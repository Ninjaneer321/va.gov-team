### {{STEP_NUMBER}} Design review touchpoints (Optional)

These touchpoints with the Governance Team ensure your product aligns with VA.gov standards for design, IA, content, and accessibility at different stages in the design process. Teams who complete one or both design touchpoints have reported feeling better prepared for Staging Review and are less likely to have launch-blocking findings.
