# Contact us page
The Contact us page ([va.gov/contact-us](va.gov/contact-us)) on VA.gov helps people get answers to questions about VA benefits and services. It connects people to the following types of customer support channels: 
- **Self-service**: I can find solutions independently through resources provided by VA.
- **Live agent**: I can talk to a VA agent in real-time.
- **Asynchronous agent**: I can send messages or questions on my own time and review responses later.
