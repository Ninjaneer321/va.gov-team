 ## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
[I have been a Veteran, joined in 78, and got out 93.
I have but sometimes I get frustrated because I’m not getting what I need. So I usually call.  
*What was your most recent experience? -I travel expense/travel pay.  A few months ago I was eligible again and I went in to put in my information and I wasn’t approved and I called to but I was not getting anyone and was going around in circles. I called and they gave me a number and I didn’t get an answer. Maybe if I go to the app and send a message and I went to secure messaging. I think within an hour I got an answer back. I had signed up for direct deposit but when I looked it seemed that it didn’t take.]

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[ I would do a couple things, I would start with the chat or Contact as online to see if that questions has been asked. Or maybe in Call Us. I might do a few different things that puts me in the right direction. 
I would go to Chatbot, it opens, but it also opens up a  411 number and I would go to the 1800 number. I would go to the number since that is the next thing I see pop up. 
*Why that number? - Because I need to know about benefits.
*What would you do next if that was no help?- I will go back on here and look over the numbers. I will call the Hotline. When I call someone, I can express myself better. 
I’m still working on getting better at this online stuff since that seems what everyone is doing. You have to write a paragraph (on chatbot), I would rather call you.]
*What do you think Contact Us Online means? -I think I may get something. It might be a regular chat thing. I think I read it wrong. 
Now, it looks like I may be able to get a chat going. Chat means to me where I think we go back and forth. Like a text-type thing. 
### Claims scenario
[I’m reading the headings to see the description. Sometimes this blue area is helpful. I’m looking for anything that clicks me to where I can create a log in. I’m not seeing anything. 
They have “explore resources and support” and here I might start playing around to see if I can find out what I need and click things. 
If I put in here help with creating log on, let me see what does. Link for creating an account for VA.gov. There you go. It’s helping me create a log on. 
*Would you stay on this page? I would try on here. I think I might have to call the VA 411. If I stay on here it’s going to ask me for an ID that I don’t have. If I go to ID.me, I’m trying to ID myself without creating but I would go on here to create it.  ]

## Review each scenario
[It all depends on the user and I’m pretty resourceful and play with it and sometimes you’ll find someone that can’t find what they are looking for and give up right away. It needs to be personalized. 
*What would like to see when you think personalize? -That you know exactly what I think. You would have to have a few different formats for someone savvy (vs not so savvy). 
*What would be the ideal Contact Us page for you? -The search bar because I have been trying to learn how to word it so it can go faster.]

## Cool down
[I think I would go to the search bar. I would like it to be more broader. Can create a login with just a passport. I think creating an account with ID.me would have gone a lot better. ]
