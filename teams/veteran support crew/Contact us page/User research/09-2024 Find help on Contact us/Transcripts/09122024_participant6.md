## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: And first, I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with VA customer support. So starting off around how long have you been a veteran?

> P6: I've been a veteran since [number]. I joined in [number], I got out in [number], so [number] years, something like that.

Becky: Yeah, that's very impressive. Remembering exact exact year dates. I know I struggle with that.

> P6: Well, I turned 18 into service, so, very easily.

Bcky: Yeah, that's awesome.

> P6: And, and in your time as a veteran, have you ever used the Contact us page on v.gov or, or maybe reached out to VA for customer support, anything like that?

> P6: I have. And sometimes I get frustrated because I'm either not finding what I need or I'm not. Maybe I'm not asking in the right way. So I'm not sure if it's the program or it's me. 

> P6: So I usually just try to call somebody. I'm like, am I calling the right place? I always get the answer one way or the other, but sometimes I struggle a little bit.

Becky: Yeah. I'm, I'm curious, can you walk me through the most recent experience you've had with maybe using the Contact us page or reaching out to VA for help?

> P6: Well, I was trying, I do travel, you know, expense, you know, travel pay.

> P6: So I was trying to get that started again, 'cause I, you know, I, I, I wasn't qualifying for a while because of my, you know, with the, my, my, my income.

> P6: But then now I think it was two months ago, whatever I, you know, became eligible again.
 
> P6: So I wanted to go in there and I did and I was able to go on there and do my, you know, in, you know, put in for my pay or whatnot.

> P6: But some of them were saying, I don't remember that word, but it wasn't approved for whatever reason, it was right.

> P6: So I said, well, I gotta call somebody to see, you know, what should I do? Am I doing something wrong?

> P6: So I went into the page and like contact us, call us and I wasn't getting anybody. I wasn't getting to try to get a travel expense.

> P6: I wasn't I was like going around in circles. I said, just gotta something gotta be wrong. So then I went and I tried because I don't give up on anything.

> P6: I called and they gave me a number, called this number and nobody was answering the number. I was frustrated.

> P6: I said, you know what, I'm gonna give it a rest. Maybe I'm just being frustrated so I'm not getting what I need.

> P6: But in a couple of days I said, you know what? I think maybe if I go to the, you know, the app, maybe if I send a message, you know, secure messaging, maybe that'll work.

> P6: So I went in there and I went through secure messaging and I don't remember the exact. I think it said travel something. I don't remember what it was.

> P6: I went in there and I said, well, I'm not sure if I'm getting the right person, but this is what I need to do.
 
> P6: I think within an hour I got an answer back. I think within an hour I got an answer back. And he says, oh, walk me through it.

> P6: Look through this, look through that. Fantastic. Apparently I had, I had signed up for direct deposit, but when I did it, it didn't look like it took.

> P6: Does that make any sense?

Becky: Yeah.

> P6: It didn't give me like, hey, OK, congratulations, whatever, something like that. So I thought I didn't do it, but I was just seeing my checks coming in because they were going directly into my account and I it's only a few dollars that you really don't really notice, you know what I mean?

> P6: Your, your account goes up and down. So that was it. But yeah, I was frustrated. But I, I, I just can figure out a way, 'cause I'll go back and forth or I'll get a number to call. I'll call somebody. So yeah.

Becky: Yeah. You really persisted and found the right person at the end. But yeah, it's really frustrating. It took you, you know, so many tries.

Becky: So you started with phone. And then lastly, the secure messaging on the app was was where you could find your answer.

> P6: Yeah. I didn't think I would find it there. I thought that was just like, you know, the doctor's or maybe a pharmacy. Then I said, you know what, let me just look in there.

> P6: Maybe, maybe it'll take me somewhere. And it did. It really did. I was really, really impressed.

Becky: Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. Well, not awesome. You know, you had to call.

> P6: So no, that's why. Live and learn.

Becky: Oh, well, it's so helpful to learn about that experience that you've had just trying to contact support. 

## Scenarios
Becky: In the rest of the research session, I'll give you 2 scenarios where you as a veteran would reach out to VA for help.

Becky: So these are actually scenarios that are real questions veterans asked us this year, just reworded.

> P6: OK, Yeah.

Becky: And before we do that, I'm going to send you a link to our current Contact us page on VA.gov, which which may look familiar to you.

Becky: So I'll send it in the chat right now and let me know if you can open that link.

> P6: And you want me to do it right through the chat?

Becky: Yes. Yeah, open the chat and then you can click on the link.

> P6: Oh, you're assuming I know what I'm doing, right?

Becky: That's no worries, on the bottom...

> P6: Oh you see here it goes. OK, chat. OK, so I see something there. Oh, here it goes. So I'm just going to go click on it.

Becky: Yes.

> P6: OK, so I see it's is it going? It's not doing anything though. Oh, there it goes. OK, I see it says Contact us, get answers to your question, blah blah blah blah. Yeah, I got it.

Becky: OK, perfect. The second question and I can definitely help out with this next one is if you have you ever shared your screen on Zoom before?

> P6: I believe I did it last time I did, I did do it.

> P6: It actually, do permission. I did, I did, I have done it.

Becky: OK, Could you share your screen with the contact us page shown up at the bottom should be a share icon. It might be green. And then if you select that, it might ask you what you want to share, which is your screen. And then you'll have to select the page that's open.

> P6: Now I have to go back to where you're at. I have to go back to your picture.

Becky: Oh, yes, yeah. So go ahead and go back to the Zoom app.

> P6: Oh, did I kick you out? OK. You said at the bottom there should be a share. Let's close this. Is it being... OK. It says share contact content. Is that what you want?

Becky: What are the other options there?

> P6: It says it has a mute star video, share contact participants more. It doesn't give me...

Becky: Share content should be right. So you can go ahead and click on that share content.

> P6: Then it says screen photos, iCloud website, whiteboard, you want screen, right?

Becky: Yes, screen.

> P6: OK, screen it says everything on your screen, including notifications will be recorded. Enable do not disturb to prevent unexpected notifications.

> P6: OK, So start broadcast.
 
Becky: Yes, you can start your broadcast.

> P6: OK. It says start broadcast.

Becky: Oh, perfect. OK, I can see what's on your screen right now. And now what you need to do is just you can either navigate to the page you opened or just go back to the chat and select the the link I sent again.

Becky: So whatever is easiest for you there.

> P6: You could tell I'm not a expert on this thing, right?

Becky: No, no worries. I think you're doing great.

> P6: Yep there I go.

Becky: Perfect.

> P6: I'm probable with technology.

Becky: No, you know, you're doing great.
 
> P6: Are you good there? Can you see? I see you at the top, right? That's my mother going in and out. Yeah, that's my mother going in and in and out of my my house.

Becky: No worries.

> P6: Can you see my screen? Yes, I can see your screen right now.

> P6: OK.

Becky: All right. So we're ready to to go ahead with the first scenario. So again, you're, you're a veteran in this scenario and you currently get disability compensation for shoulder pain.

Becky: And you notice that your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months. And you want to know if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's worse now.

Becky: And so starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this scenario. Yeah. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and what what you're noticing out loud too.

> P6: Well, you said I'm getting compensation for, So I'm getting what that is that, that's social security, disability or something, right? Am I correct?

Becky: Yeah, compensation for a VA-related condition.

> P6: OK. I would probably do a couple of things and see which one leads me in the right direction. I would probably start a a a chat and say hey this is the scenario.

> P6: Do you have a number I can call or I didn't even try to go Contact us online through ask VA and see if they already have that question being asked and answered.

Becky: OK, is there a reason why you'd want to do the Well, I noticed you said chat, but are you referring to the chat bot?

> P6: The chat bot, yeah, the ask the question. Yeah, 'cause usually, usually when you go through not only getting through the VA, but anything I, I do a lot of the chat that way and they usually the guide me in the right direction.

> P6: Or he had called this number or I'll have a live agent call you and, you know, and that's, that seems to work pretty good for me.

> P6: Or there's even a call us. I may even call, do a call us. There might be a number there.

> P6: So I may do a lot of different things to see which one, you know, puts me in the right direction.

Becky: Yeah, Yeah, that makes sense. And since you mentioned doing chat first, I'm wondering do you want to go ahead and and show me how you would do that?

> P6: OK, I would go. It should give me a little option there. OK.

> P6: So once I hit the chat [the jump link], it opened up to learn more about it and ask a question, but it also opened up a 411 information.

> P6: So I'll read through that to see what's going on there. And then it says, it says VA benefits hotline. There's a number right there. Boom. I can call that number.

> P6: It gave me a 800 number right there. I don't even have to go anymore. I don't believe so.

Becky: Oh, OK, So maybe are you saying you would you'd maybe skip the chat bot 1st and go straight to the number since that's the next thing you see?

> P6: Yeah, and that's the next thing I did. It just popped up. So I see an 800 number and they're open pretty late. They're Monday through Friday till 9:00. So that's pretty good.

> P6: So I do, I'll assume that's right. There is a, it says be a vendor, but you can't get any better than that.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. Why that phone number and not any of the others that you're seeing right now?

> P6: Because I need, I need to know about benefits. OK, that's what I'm thinking. I may be wrong, but this is and I call them, they say, hey, no, it is benefit related, but you should this is a better number.

> P6: Then they might give me another number. They might be able to help me.

Becky: OK, OK, so you're expecting maybe they can help you, maybe they'll give you a number, but it's really that word benefits that's drawing you to the number it sounds like, right?

Becky: OK, you know, let's say you call the number and they don't quite answer your question. What would you do next in the scenario?

> P6: Well, if they don't ask my question and I and I and they can't tell me further, I'll go right back on here and somebody's going to answer my questions.

> P6: I'll go right back here. Oh, there's another number here. It says VA health benefit hotline. I can call them as well too. There's another number.

Becky: OK. And I noticed you like before you mentioned, you know, you might do some of the online options, but when you see the phone numbers, you're, you're drawn to them first.

Becky: And so I'm wondering why, why would you call rather than any other option? Like what What draws you to calling first?

> P6: Two reasons. First of all, when when you call, this is some, even with regular, when I do that even to my kids, sometimes I call them and I want to say something to them.

> P6: I text them and they're like, but I'm like, no, if I call somebody, I can express myself better rather than to and I can give them like the whole scenario rather than to like it's blue.

> P6: Oh, but why is it, you know what I mean? It's too much back and forth and it just to me, it's like, I can't do it. I can't type that fast.

> P6: And if it seems like, you know, sometimes when you text someone and you and the text doesn't sound the way you want it to tell you, does that make sense?

> P6: So I think if I speak to someone, I say, Hey, let me this is what I have. And sometimes they, you don't even have to get out the whole story and they know exactly what it is.
 
> P6: So this is what you want. Or they have to write words that you need to say, you know what I mean? Does that make sense? Like I'm doing right now to you?

> P6: So that's why. So that's why I think to me it's easier if I can call someone and then, you know, they may say, hey, you have to do this online.

> P6: Then I said, OK, then I'll then they'll either send me a link or say, hey, you know, go online. It should be pretty simple.

> P6: But if you have questions, you know, feel free to call or not. So I think that's why I would prefer a number.

> P6: But if I, I, I am still, I'm learning how to get better at just trying to maneuver the online stuff 'cause that's where everybody's going.

### Login scenario
[ I would do a couple things, I would start with the chat or Contact as online to see if that questions has been asked. Or maybe in Call Us. I might do a few different things that puts me in the right direction. 
I would go to Chatbot, it opens, but it also opens up a  411 number and I would go to the 1800 number. I would go to the number since that is the next thing I see pop up. 
*Why that number? - Because I need to know about benefits.
*What would you do next if that was no help?- I will go back on here and look over the numbers. I will call the Hotline. When I call someone, I can express myself better. 
I’m still working on getting better at this online stuff since that seems what everyone is doing. You have to write a paragraph (on chatbot), I would rather call you.]
*What do you think Contact Us Online means? -I think I may get something. It might be a regular chat thing. I think I read it wrong. 
Now, it looks like I may be able to get a chat going. Chat means to me where I think we go back and forth. Like a text-type thing. 
### Claims scenario
[I’m reading the headings to see the description. Sometimes this blue area is helpful. I’m looking for anything that clicks me to where I can create a log in. I’m not seeing anything. 
They have “explore resources and support” and here I might start playing around to see if I can find out what I need and click things. 
If I put in here help with creating log on, let me see what does. Link for creating an account for VA.gov. There you go. It’s helping me create a log on. 
*Would you stay on this page? I would try on here. I think I might have to call the VA 411. If I stay on here it’s going to ask me for an ID that I don’t have. If I go to ID.me, I’m trying to ID myself without creating but I would go on here to create it.  ]

## Review each scenario
[It all depends on the user and I’m pretty resourceful and play with it and sometimes you’ll find someone that can’t find what they are looking for and give up right away. It needs to be personalized. 
*What would like to see when you think personalize? -That you know exactly what I think. You would have to have a few different formats for someone savvy (vs not so savvy). 
*What would be the ideal Contact Us page for you? -The search bar because I have been trying to learn how to word it so it can go faster.]

## Cool down
[I think I would go to the search bar. I would like it to be more broader. Can create a login with just a passport. I think creating an account with ID.me would have gone a lot better. ]
