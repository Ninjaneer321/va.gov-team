## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
[*How long have you been a Veteran? -Since 1973. 
*Have you reached out to VA for support? -I think once or twice.
First I looked up on the internet how to get with the VA. There was a number that and left messages and then realized that’s not what to do. I went online and filled out the form online. I think it was 2018 when I did the form.
 I’ve used it on the VA. gov side and it was pretty easy.
*Do you have a preference? – I like the VA.gov because it quick and easy. 

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[*Why did you click Ask VA? -Seemed like the most logical place to go. If you want to do anything with the VA, you AskVA. You go to the VA and ask that question might be the easiest way to do it.
*What do you think Contact us online means?- Through the website.
*What do you expect to happen?- I expect that in a timely manner I would get a response back or an answer.
*Is that what you would try and do first when you have a question? -When I go to the VA homesite, they have that information and look up where I can tell them the information I’m looking for and pull up an article and or a number I’m looking for.
*What would you do next if this path didn’t work for you? I don’t know, I grab one and I dial. Then they redirect me. 
*What are you skimming through? -I’m trying to see if there is an actual phone number to call in for information. The East Coast numbers have all the good stuff.
If I don’t see, I call the VA help desk and that takes me to where I need to go.
It’s when they are automated that drives me nuts. You end up hitting zero and sometimes that helps.]
### Claims scenario
[Where is my disabilities. Looking for that key word.(helpful online tool)
*What do you think Helpful online tool means? -When you get a hyperlink, it will take you right to the page that you need to go. 
You have not been able to sign in the VA website, that might be difficult. 
*Would you sign in if you landed on this page? -I see at the bottom to check in, I assume I’d be under that and then sign in to see and make an appointment and go from there.
*What would you do if you didn’t find an answer? -I would call the hospital or main number and speak to a person at that point. I would call the central scheduling number and they will send me to the right direction I need to go to. (Participant has saved numbers he has previously had interactions with).]

## Review each scenario
[ It would be nice to get the phone numbers, depending on where you are for the State you are in, it would give you the main numbers for that State.]

## Cool down
[*What did you think of those two pages for the scenarios? -Those are the two I use the most.It showed me what the new page can help me get more information.
*What made it easier? -The way it’s laid out, simpler terms.]
