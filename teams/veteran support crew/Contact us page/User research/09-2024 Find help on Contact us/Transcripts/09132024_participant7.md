## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
[I joined in 1974. I started using the VA in 2010. Then I got more involved with My Healthy Vet and got more involved. 
*Have you used Contact Us? -I don’t recall. I have used Secure messaging.
I’ve had 4 femoral surgeries and I have recurring pain and going to a VA chiropractor for years who referred me to an Ortho specialist. Ended up referring me back to my civilian Orthopedic doctor and prescribed me medication and denied by Medicare and Tricare. I have a lot of communication with my doctors. 
The emails are just secure messaging with my VA. It seems that at one time the civilian doctors and VA doctors were able to see each other's notes. Now, I’m hand delivering my charts/ x-rays to from the VA to my civilian doctors.]

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[This is really here a link, I want to more so contact someone. I think I would call the VA benefits hotline. I prefer to talk to someone and ask where I need to go. I know from past experience, I can click on these links I end up in a rabbit hole and three hours later I forget what I was even looking for. I may or not be talking to someone if I’m typing. It could be a robot, you don’t don’t know. 
*Were you looking for keywords? -Yes. The VA website, I get extremely frustrated trying to use it. Even if there were a search box. 
The whole list of numbers might by a rabbit hole. 
99% of the time, If I'm looking on the site, I can’t find it. If I look in community care, I will search it and it will not give me the right information.  
*You called the Hotline number, and you didn’t get the answer you need? -Go to the West Virginia representative of the VA Affairs. I have used them at least four times in the past year. That is the last resort for me.]
### Claims scenario
[I would go down to My Healthy Vet desk and tell them I need to create a login and help me. 
*What response are you expecting? -Hopefully to talk to a person and get some guidance on where I need to go. 
* What next step would you take? -I will look at what else is available. I will also look into FAQs.
Chatbox might be able to work but I might just call and hope to speak with a person.
*What do you think Contact us means?-I clicked on it, this is the page for the headings for what I’m looking for. Contact us, Welcome to ask VA. 
What information is missing for you? – A really good search box. I can type what I am looking for but 99% of the time nothing fits what I’m trying to find.]

## Review each scenario
[When I see a form like that, I feel like I have to fill in every box. I wouldn’t skip this, sometimes I get hung up and what I need is not listed there. 
A lot of times, it gives you too much information and it’s overwhelming, you don’t read it, get more confused. A lot of times I start clicking all the links and I’ll go down the rabbit hole.]

## Cool down
[Too many options. It needs to be where you need to be. Then even simpler after that. On that search box, it would be so valuable if it worked.
*What would an ideal page look like?- X-rays for example, if you need to have 10 different words that is the same thing, so be it instead of having 10 different options.]
