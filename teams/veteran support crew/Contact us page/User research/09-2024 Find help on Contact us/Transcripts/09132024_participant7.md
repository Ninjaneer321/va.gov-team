## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: And first, I'd like to begin just learning more about your experience with VA and VA customer support. So around how long have you been a veteran?

> P7: Well, I joined the military in [number] and so I really started using the VA probably back in about [number].

> P7: So and, and then as as I progressed, I, I got more and more involved in using My HealtheVet and and that type of thing using more and more of the, the services and technology that was available.

Becky: Awesome. Yeah. And in your, in your experience using those services, have you ever used the Contact us page on VA.gov in particular?

> P7: I don't recall.

Becky: OK.

> P7: I, I do use secure messaging. So I I'm in contact with my providers quite frequently with the secure messaging, but I'm not aware of the contact us or whatever you just said page on va.gov.

Becky: Yeah, yeah. So 2 follow up questions that are coming to mind for you, but I'll ask one first. Can you walk me through maybe your most recent experience just reaching out to VA around any help you needed? Like you mentioned secure messaging, what that was like?

[P7 talks about most recent experience with VA secure messaging]

Becky: Got it.

[P7 talks more about health experience]

Becky: So I noticed you talked a lot about your health benefits and so I'm, I'm assuming here, but I want to confirm, did you do all this through secure messaging like this back and forth through VA or was it also through a phone call or e-mail, anything like that?

> P7: The email's pretty much the, the secure messaging with, with VA, I also use, and we'll call it MyChart. It's not, it's not my chart with, with the civilian Dr.

> P7: So and then trying to go between the two, it seems like, yeah, it is my chart. It seems like at one time the civilian doctors and the VA was able to see each other's notes or, or whatever, you know, but that's not always the case and usually it's not.

> P7: So that would be very beneficial if the doctors inside the VA and outside the VA had more communication and access to my [records.]

[P7 talks about specific health story]

Becky: So sounds like a lot of messaging and but you're saying there there wasn't a lot of communication between the civilian provider and the VA provider there?

> P7: Not at all. I'm the link.

[P7 talks about specific health story]

Becky: So you, it sounds like you're you're relying on your memory for a lot of these things.

> P7: Well, not only memory, but as far As for, you know, and dealing with the VA, as far as can't think of the term, but there's no proof that that actually happened, you know?

Becky: Oh, the evidence.

> P7: Right. There's no record of it.

Becky: Got it. Yeah. I feel like, you know, your experiences might align with one of the scenarios we'll, we'll go through today.

## Scenarios
Becky: So the next part of the session is just, I'll give you 2 scenarios where you as a veteran would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions that veterans have asked us this year. Just reworded.

[Becky shares link to Contact us page. P7 screen shares]

### Login scenario
Becky: All right, so I'll give you your first scenario now and all right, so you're on the first scenario, first scenario.

Becky: So imagine you're a veteran who currently gets disability compensation for shoulder pain, and you notice your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months. But you don't know if you can request more compensation for your shoulder pain because it's worse now.

Becky: So you want to know if you can request more compensation. Starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing too.

> P7: OK, Yeah, let's say yeah...

Becky: Yes, I see you, you may stopped on, sorry and I might interject just to ask what you're thinking, But I see you stopped on the contact us online through Ask VA. That first section. What were you doing there?

> P7: I was reading what options I had to click on to see what might be most appropriate for my question.

Becky: I see you're scrolling down now.

> P7: Yeah, "Your VA benefits and services...", but this really isn't a link. I mean that this is more information [description text under Explore our FAQs... section].

> P7: I'm wanting to contact somebody. Check your claim, or appeal. Nope. Schedule manage... Nope. Let me go back up.

> P7: I think I would call the VA benefits hotline. I think that would be I would prefer to talk to somebody and say, hey, here's my problem. Where do I need to go?

I prefer to talk to someone and ask where I need to go. I know from past experience, I can click on these links I end up in a rabbit hole and three hours later I forget what I was even looking for. I may or not be talking to someone if I’m typing. It could be a robot, you don’t don’t know. 
*Were you looking for keywords? -Yes. The VA website, I get extremely frustrated trying to use it. Even if there were a search box. 
The whole list of numbers might by a rabbit hole. 
99% of the time, If I'm looking on the site, I can’t find it. If I look in community care, I will search it and it will not give me the right information.  
*You called the Hotline number, and you didn’t get the answer you need? -Go to the West Virginia representative of the VA Affairs. I have used them at least four times in the past year. That is the last resort for me.]
### Claims scenario
[I would go down to My Healthy Vet desk and tell them I need to create a login and help me. 
*What response are you expecting? -Hopefully to talk to a person and get some guidance on where I need to go. 
* What next step would you take? -I will look at what else is available. I will also look into FAQs.
Chatbox might be able to work but I might just call and hope to speak with a person.
*What do you think Contact us means?-I clicked on it, this is the page for the headings for what I’m looking for. Contact us, Welcome to ask VA. 
What information is missing for you? – A really good search box. I can type what I am looking for but 99% of the time nothing fits what I’m trying to find.]

## Review each scenario
[When I see a form like that, I feel like I have to fill in every box. I wouldn’t skip this, sometimes I get hung up and what I need is not listed there. 
A lot of times, it gives you too much information and it’s overwhelming, you don’t read it, get more confused. A lot of times I start clicking all the links and I’ll go down the rabbit hole.]

## Cool down
[Too many options. It needs to be where you need to be. Then even simpler after that. On that search box, it would be so valuable if it worked.
*What would an ideal page look like?- X-rays for example, if you need to have 10 different words that is the same thing, so be it instead of having 10 different options.]
