## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
[I retired in 2022. 
*Have you used Contact Us? -Yes.
My most recent was for my son's transfer of GI bill to him. He had gotten a payment and didn’t make sense and went to the Contact me page and clicked on Chatbot, didn’t get the exact response and got a response two days later using the same system. 
*Are you going to call to get an answer next time? -We wont call, I don’t have that time. I usually try and resolve it through message apps.
We do a lot of searching on Reddit. I search through that. This one was new to us. 
*Would you call VA to get an answer more immediately? -No. My experience with calling has been more frustrating (calling the VA past experience).
*Why do you keep using Chatbot? -Typically because that is where you have to start. Typically like a bank, you have to start with Chatbot. ]

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[I would not use the Chatbot, I would not go to the Call Us because I don’t want to do that. I would go to the FAQ’s, might be there. Maybe it would be into signing into the VA.gov. I will search logging in, but it doesn’t really say.
*Would you expect to see this type of support on this type of website? -I would because it’s a login issue/creating a login account, it's before the login on the page since I can't get to the other side. I would think there would be something more of a discussion of identification. I know if I tried to use the Ask VA, I would go there. 
*What do you think the Ask online means? -That would be through the secure messaging system.
*Do you know what other Other Resources might be? -Might be a one-page with picture document, but I can’t think of other resources that isn’t covered in the FAQ.
I might look to helpful online tools. Looking at it, I don’t think it has anything I’m looking for. 
*What would you add? -Online web forms. Electronic forms that I would of filled out on paper before
*How would you decide which phone number to call? -I wouldn't use the TTY, it’s not a benefits or GI question, not a health website. I could look in other helpful numbers. I might click in the full list of numbers, but I might call the 411 number. 
To put a Contact Us or phone number on the front page, it might be helpful. Then I wouldn’t have to call this 411 number that is very dreadful. ]
### Claims scenario
[I would start with Chatbot. I feel like the Chatbot might have some things that it can do here. I would start chat and type increase for a disability rating. I think I need claims information, how to file a disability claim, I can submit a claim based on conditions I already have. I think I can file for compensation online. 
*How do you look for that information? I would click on eligibility, am I eligible, I would go back to this disability benefits page. I’m not sure where I’m going here. 
*Would you start on the Contact Us page? I would have gone to my ratings page. ]
*What other channels would you go to? I would give Chatbot another chance. I would have used Reddit before or even searched Google. 
## Review each scenario
[The answer you found, seems hidden. The other one is, maybe because it’s internal, can’t transfer you to another place, a warm handoff- I hate that I would have to dial a new number instead of transferring. That’s a process that can be improved. I know its hard if it's even possible. ]

## Cool down
[What did you like or dislike? It’s set up the way I would expect. Contact Us gives me enough to know. The way it’s set up is the way I would go. My feedback is that the general information line has the helpful numbers first. My VA 411, other helpful numbers, and everything else below that. The other helpful online tools, I don’t see that as related to everything else. I don’t know how that is more helpful than the other numbers. I don’t see the connection with everything else and the grey box.]
