## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: So we're ready to get started, and we'll first start with just learning more about your general experience with VA customer support. And so firstly, how long have you been a veteran?

> P2: I retired in [number], so just over [number] years.

Becky: And in that two years, have you ever used the contact page on va.gov?

> P2: Yes.

Becky: Can you walk me through your most recent experience with using the page and, you know, what you're trying to look for, and if you're able to find the information you are looking for?

> P2: Yeah. So my most recent using it was for my son. So I transferred GI Bill benefit to him. And so we were looking for, he had gotten a payment for education benefit, and it didn't, the amount didn't make sense.

> P2: So we went to the contact me page. I was with, me and him, and we started with the chat bot asking about what was the most recent payment, and then it said it couldn't, it couldn't get recent payments.

> P2: And so we went back to the contact me page and used the secure contact page to send an email or basically a message through the system. And then, yeah.

> P2: So that was the, that we we got a response 2 days later. So I had to go back in and found the, found the response and using the same system. So kind of came back 2 days later to the same page.

Becky: Got it, and you know, you mentioned with the chat bot, you didn't quite exactly get your answer with the messaging. Were they able to successfully answer your question?

> P2: Kind of, it was a, the response was, I asked, because in my experience, I know I have to be as detailed as I can.

> P2: So my question was, you know, I thought, well spelled out like, explain the most recent payment, and the response back was that payment hasn't been processed yet, so we will know once it's processed. Although I had been paid so, or he had been paid, so I kind of changed my expectations to, maybe we'll know more in October.

> P2: Once the new one, it processes, which sounds like it hadn't processed. So kind of answered it.

Becky: OK, that's, that's a relatable customer experience from, from my own experience as well. So I guess are you planning on following up or, or even calling?

> P2: we won't call. I don't have that kind of time. And it's just, it's super frustrating to be on hold for hours.

> P2: So typically, I try and resolve it all through message apps. It's not an emergency by any means. In this case we'll just wait for the next month.

> P2: In this case, it would be a little different, because he has another scholarship. So that's paying. So I'm not in a dire need for an answer.

> P2: So we would, we talked about it. We'll wait until October payment, and then, if that's not resolved, then reach out again.

Becky: Got it. Did you ever before using the chat bot, or messaging? Did you ever try to find the answers online first, through searching. And how did that go? If you did.

> P2: Yeah. So we do a lot of searching through, especially for benefits part through Reddit. There's a really good stream on Reddit for veterans, benefits. And so I search for that.

> P2: This one was a little nuanced because it's a state of Florida thing. I'm using a State of Florida benefit and a VA benefit. And so there's a lot of, you know.

> P2: It's a, it's a pretty nuanced thing that I couldn't find a whole lot of information about so, but yeah, I always start there first. Before I go to the VA website, I try and read there first to see if I can find anything else, and then go to the VA Website.

Becky:  Got it. Yes, we've heard from veterans, too, that Reddit is a very useful resource to hear from other veterans with similar situations. But it sounds like this is a very, it sounds like this is a very specific situation. So it was hard to find some answers there.

Becky: I'm curious. Is there ever a situation where you would use, where you would call VA to get an answer, maybe more immediately, or I know you try to do things online first. But can you imagine a situation where you might use other contact channels?

> P2:  I can't, because my experience with calling in has been more frustrating than just sending a message. because of my past experience. No, I would. I would almost always.

> P2: I would always start with the chat bot, if that's possible. But I know there's limitations to that. I know it's new and getting better, and it's way better than it was even 2 years ago.

> P2: But yeah, I would. I can't think of a scenario unless it was an emergency, I had to talk to somebody now. But I haven't run into that yet.

Becky: Yeah. And I'm curious. Has your past experiences with calling VA or calling customer support in general, sort of given you the expectation of of what a phone call might be?

> P2: The VA

Becky: Okay. VA, gotcha. 

> P2: Yeah. Well, I'd say in general for all the things I reach out to first, like I think about like credit card or bank, or something like that. I will, I will, I will never call. I will always try that.

> P2: I will. I will revert to chat bot, which never works. Well, not never, hardly ever works for what I'm asking. And then personal human chat. And then email. And then call.

> P2: Well, maybe even send a letter before I call. But I haven't run into that yet.

Becky: Yeah, no, it's helpful to like. I see the your internal triage, for you know where to start, and then where to go from there. I'm curious, you know you mentioned using Chatbot, and how that often doesn't work. But but it seems like you still go back to using Chatbot. Is there any any particular reason why?

> P2: Typically cause. That's where you have to start. If you don't, like, I'm thinking other things. Not necessarily VA, because, VA, I can just send a secure message.

> P2: But typically like a a bank or credit card, you almost always have to start with the chat Bot, and I'll ask the question. It won't understand. And so I'll just type human or operator, or something to override the system, you know, to to make it go to a human chat.

Becky: Got it. Okay? So what you're talking about is more the like Chatbot to live agent chat experience you've had on other on other sites.

> P2: Yes

Becky: Great well, thanks, for you know, walking through your your process in the past with using the Contact us page and with support with VA.

## Scenarios
Becky: For the rest of the session, now I'll give you 2 scenarios where you, as a Veteran, would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions Veterans asked us this year, just reworded. So before we do that, do that, I'll send you a link to our current Contact us page. 

Becky: And then, and let me know if you have any trouble with opening that.

> P2: Got it? Well, maybe here it goes. Well, try again. Okay I have it.

Becky: All right, and have you shared your screen on Zoom before?

> P2: Yes. I'm not as good at this as Teams, but here we go.

Becky: No worries. Okay awesome. That was amazingly quick. So that's great. Alright. So I'll give you your first scenario. Now, again, we'll review two total scenarios in this session.

### Login scenario
Becky: So I'd like you. Oh oops all of my screens. Just minimize. Okay, I'd like you to pretend that you're a Veteran, and you're having trouble creating an account on VA.gov.

Becky: So you're trying to create a Login.gov account. But Login.gov doesn't let you use your passport as a form of identification. However, you don't have your driver's license or any other forms of identification. You've you've recently lost your driver's license. So that's why you're using your passport.

Becky: So starting on this page, the one you have open right now, can you show me how you would find help for this scenario? And as you're showing me, just tell me what you're thinking and noticing, too, on the page. And yeah, that's the scenario.

> P2: I think this is a very. It seems like my my chain of thought is, it's kind of a specific request again, so I probably would not use the chat Bot. Knowing the functionality of the chat bot.

 > P2: I would not go to the call us, because I don't. I don't want to do that. One thing that does that stick out to me is the frequently asked questions. So I might look there to see if there are any topics that might be helpful how to use VA.gov to manage your benefits, it might be there.

> P2: So I would probably click. Don't you just go ahead and click around. Is that okay?

Becky: Go ahead and interact. 

> P2:  Okay, so I probably click in here. And it was the id me, was that the one or which? Which? Which one am I trying.

Becky: Yeah, you're trying to create an account with Login.gov, but you can't use your passport. That's the scenario or the problem right now.

> P2: Okay, so I don't know, so maybe it would be signing into VA.gov. Issues with signing in. I see here. What if I don't have... It doesn't really give me the information here that I'd be looking for.

> P2: I might look under problems. Try and do a search. 'logging in.' Oh, by the way, typing in front of people is my biggest fear.

Becky: It's all good.

> P2: So see if that gives me anything problem long again. I don't know if it will. Issues with, you know, it's kind of issues of signing in. But it doesn't really say. And this is not going very quickly. Starting again. Try that again.

> P2: Looks like it's locked on my side, which doesn't really surprise me.

Becky: Yeah, no worries while we're while this page is loading. Some follow-up questions for me. So you know you, it seems like you gravitated towards the FAQ link, first on the Contact us page. 

Becky: Would you expect to see this type of support on a on a Contact us page on the website?

> P2: Yeah, I would only because I mean, if it's a, if it's a login issue, I guess it's not really a login issue.

> P2: It's a creating a website issue or creating a login account issue. I would, I would think it would be.

> P2: I mean, it's definitely on the before the firewall or before the login, you know, on the front side of the page as opposed to behind the sign in because I'm having trouble signing in, so I can't get to the other side.

> P2: So that's where I would expect it to be.

> P2: I would think that there would be something my, my whole login is not going here or the whole website's locked up for me

Becky: That may be an issue on our end. So don't worry about trying to search right now.

> P2: Yeah Ok. So I think, I think it would be about, you know, more of a discussion on what are acceptable forms of ID or something like that for login.

> P2: I think I would find that that would make sense to me to be in a frequently asked questions page.

> P2: And if it yeah, that that's why I would expect to find it if I couldn't find it there.

> P2: I know if I tried to do that through through Ask VA, there's a secure and a non secure side.

> P2: So that would be my next. If I couldn't find anything there and I had already used Reddit, that would be my next. That would be my next line would be to contact through the Ask VA link there.

Becky: And I know this question maybe a bit biased because you already have experience with Ask VA, it seems, but what do you think contact us online means

> P2: That would be through the secure messaging system where it's going to go to a A, VA, you know, the, the right VA Rep that can answer that question and get it back to me via, well I mean it's a secure system.

> P2: So it would come back to me, I'd get an e-mail that said, hey, there's an answer, go back and check it out.

> P2: And I would expect in this case, I wouldn't have to log in to get the answer because I don't, I can't log in.

> P2: So I would think there would be a difference between, you know, just a general question and a secure question about my account specifically.

Becky: Got it. No, no, that totally makes sense. And yeah, the the reason why I asked you is sometimes, you know, this language can be a bit ambiguous or general contact us online.

Becky: But it sounds like, you know, you have an understanding that this means to send a message, a secure message.

Becky: I notice you use that phrase in particular to send a secure message to VA. Yeah, that makes sense to me. 

Becky: And real quick, going back to the FA QS Section 2, I wanted to ask what do you think resources and support means?

Becky: This is another, you know, phrase we use to to talk about this section of the website.

> P2: I would think, let's see. So FAQs, step by step guides and other resources. Other resources might be I, I kind of think, I'm not really sure what a different resource would be other than like, like at work, we create a one pager document that has a picture and some information about something that you, you know, a specific area of a website you might be interested or something like that.

> P2: So maybe that, but I can't think of any, you know, an an other resource other than what would be covered in FAQ because to me, step by step guides come from the FAQ. How do you do this? And then it'll reference you out and give you step one through 10. This is how you do it.

> P2: But I'm not really totally sure what another resource would be.

Becky: No, that's helpful to to hear how that phrase is still a bit confusing in relation to, you know, the other, the other pieces of content we have outlined here.

Becky: So you mentioned, you know, going through the FAQ section, then you would try to send a message if for whatever reason those two channels do not work out.

Becky: What would be your next step in sort of trying to get an answer to to your login account creation issue?

> P2: I might look at helpful online tools. I saw that there, which seems a lot like, wait, is that the FAQs? Oh, yeah, I just noticed that. So I might look at what that is helpful Online Tools, which looking at this box, I don't think that really does anything that I'm looking for.

> P2: So, so chat bot didn't work.

Becky: A similar question. What do you think a helpful online tool is? What is an online tool you can think of?

> P2: It seems like those are the online web forms forms things that I would normally long time ago fill out in paper, but just the electronic version of those like address changes or these are all forms that I would have filled out in paper years ago.

> P2: And so it looks like helpful, the helpful online tools are these four things limited to these four things which don't look like anything that I need to do.

Becky: OK great. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you too. I think you're going going past the online tools when I asked a follow up question.

> P2: Oh yeah, I would, I would try that. And if that didn't work, then I would be have to call somebody.

Becky: Got it. Yeah, let's, let's have a look at this section again. Your, your challenge is you only have a passport and Login.gov's not letting you create an account on va.gov with just your passport and you don't have a driver's license because you lost it.

Becky: So given that, which, how would you decide to, how would you decide which phone number to call based on this list?

> P2: I, I think it's a general question. So kind of looking here, I mean, this is the everything pile, which is monster to get through, but that's kind of the first option.

> P2: It's not I I wouldn't use the TTY because I don't have I think that's a hearing impaired thing that I don't need.

> P2: It's not a VA benefits question because it's into that. It's into, I can't get into the page at all.

> P2: It's not a GI Bill question. It's not a homeless question. Health benefits is still within the website that I can't get into my health.

> P2: That same thing. Other helpful numbers. I could look there. I'm hesitant, although I would say probably what I would do is just call the that number.

🟡

*How would you decide which phone number to call? -I wouldn't use the TTY, it’s not a benefits or GI question, not a health website. I could look in other helpful numbers. I might click in the full list of numbers, but I might call the 411 number. 
To put a Contact Us or phone number on the front page, it might be helpful. Then I wouldn’t have to call this 411 number that is very dreadful. ]
### Claims scenario
[I would start with Chatbot. I feel like the Chatbot might have some things that it can do here. I would start chat and type increase for a disability rating. I think I need claims information, how to file a disability claim, I can submit a claim based on conditions I already have. I think I can file for compensation online. 
*How do you look for that information? I would click on eligibility, am I eligible, I would go back to this disability benefits page. I’m not sure where I’m going here. 
*Would you start on the Contact Us page? I would have gone to my ratings page. ]
*What other channels would you go to? I would give Chatbot another chance. I would have used Reddit before or even searched Google. 
## Review each scenario
[The answer you found, seems hidden. The other one is, maybe because it’s internal, can’t transfer you to another place, a warm handoff- I hate that I would have to dial a new number instead of transferring. That’s a process that can be improved. I know its hard if it's even possible. ]

## Cool down
[What did you like or dislike? It’s set up the way I would expect. Contact Us gives me enough to know. The way it’s set up is the way I would go. My feedback is that the general information line has the helpful numbers first. My VA 411, other helpful numbers, and everything else below that. The other helpful online tools, I don’t see that as related to everything else. I don’t know how that is more helpful than the other numbers. I don’t see the connection with everything else and the grey box.]
