## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: So we're ready to get started, and we'll first start with just learning more about your general experience with VA customer support. And so firstly, how long have you been a veteran?

> P2: I retired in [number], so just over [number] years.

Becky: And in that two years, have you ever used the contact page on va.gov?

> P2: Yes.

Becky: Can you walk me through your most recent experience with using the page and, you know, what you're trying to look for, and if you're able to find the information you are looking for?

> P2: Yeah. So my most recent using it was for my son. So I transferred GI Bill benefit to him. And so we were looking for, he had gotten a payment for education benefit, and it didn't, the amount didn't make sense.

> P2: So we went to the contact me page. I was with, me and him, and we started with the chat bot asking about what was the most recent payment, and then it said it couldn't, it couldn't get recent payments.

> P2: And so we went back to the contact me page and used the secure contact page to send an email or basically a message through the system. And then, yeah.

> P2: So that was the, that we we got a response 2 days later. So I had to go back in and found the, found the response and using the same system. So kind of came back 2 days later to the same page.

Becky: Got it, and you know, you mentioned with the chat bot, you didn't quite exactly get your answer with the messaging. Were they able to successfully answer your question?

> P2: Kind of, it was a, the response was, I asked, because in my experience, I know I have to be as detailed as I can.

> P2: So my question was, you know, I thought, well spelled out like, explain the most recent payment, and the response back was that payment hasn't been processed yet, so we will know once it's processed. Although I had been paid so, or he had been paid, so I kind of changed my expectations to, maybe we'll know more in October.

> P2: Once the new one, it processes, which sounds like it hadn't processed. So kind of answered it.

Becky: OK, that's, that's a relatable customer experience from, from my own experience as well. So I guess are you planning on following up or, or even calling?

> P2: we won't call. I don't have that kind of time. And it's just, it's super frustrating to be on hold for hours.

> P2: So typically, I try and resolve it all through message apps. It's not an emergency by any means. In this case we'll just wait for the next month.

> P2: In this case, it would be a little different, because he has another scholarship. So that's paying. So I'm not in a dire need for an answer.

> P2: So we would, we talked about it. We'll wait until October payment, and then, if that's not resolved, then reach out again.

Becky: Got it. Did you ever before using the chat bot, or messaging? Did you ever try to find the answers online first, through searching. And how did that go? If you did.

> P2: Yeah. So we do a lot of searching through, especially for benefits part through Reddit. There's a really good stream on Reddit for veterans, benefits. And so I search for that.

> P2: This one was a little nuanced because it's a state of Florida thing. I'm using a State of Florida benefit and a VA benefit. And so there's a lot of, you know.

> P2: It's a, it's a pretty nuanced thing that I couldn't find a whole lot of information about so, but yeah, I always start there first. Before I go to the VA website, I try and read there first to see if I can find anything else, and then go to the VA Website.

Becky:  Got it. Yes, we've heard from veterans, too, that Reddit is a very useful resource to hear from other veterans with similar situations. But it sounds like this is a very, it sounds like this is a very specific situation. So it was hard to find some answers there.

Becky: I'm curious. Is there ever a situation where you would use, where you would call VA to get an answer, maybe more immediately, or I know you try to do things online first. But can you imagine a situation where you might use other contact channels?

> P2:  I can't, because my experience with calling in has been more frustrating than just sending a message. because of my past experience. No, I would. I would almost always.

> P2: I would always start with the chat bot, if that's possible. But I know there's limitations to that. I know it's new and getting better, and it's way better than it was even 2 years ago.

> P2: But yeah, I would. I can't think of a scenario unless it was an emergency, I had to talk to somebody now. But I haven't run into that yet.

Becky: Yeah. And I'm curious. Has your past experiences with calling VA or calling customer support in general, sort of given you the expectation of of what a phone call might be?

> P2: The VA

Becky: Okay. VA, gotcha. 

> P2: Yeah. Well, I'd say in general for all the things I reach out to first, like I think about like credit card or bank, or something like that. I will, I will, I will never call. I will always try that.

> P2: I will. I will revert to chat bot, which never works. Well, not never, hardly ever works for what I'm asking. And then personal human chat. And then email. And then call.

> P2: Well, maybe even send a letter before I call. But I haven't run into that yet.

Becky: Yeah, no, it's helpful to like. I see the your internal triage, for you know where to start, and then where to go from there. I'm curious, you know you mentioned using Chatbot, and how that often doesn't work. But but it seems like you still go back to using Chatbot. Is there any any particular reason why?

> P2: Typically cause. That's where you have to start. If you don't, like, I'm thinking other things. Not necessarily VA, because, VA, I can just send a secure message.

> P2: But typically like a a bank or credit card, you almost always have to start with the chat Bot, and I'll ask the question. It won't understand. And so I'll just type human or operator, or something to override the system, you know, to to make it go to a human chat.

Becky: Got it. Okay? So what you're talking about is more the like Chatbot to live agent chat experience you've had on other on other sites.

> P2: Yes

Becky: Great well, thanks, for you know, walking through your your process in the past with using the Contact us page and with support with VA.

## Scenarios
Becky: For the rest of the session, now I'll give you 2 scenarios where you, as a Veteran, would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions Veterans asked us this year, just reworded. So before we do that, do that, I'll send you a link to our current Contact us page. 

Becky: And then, and let me know if you have any trouble with opening that.

> P2: Got it? Well, maybe here it goes. Well, try again. Okay I have it.

Becky: All right, and have you shared your screen on Zoom before?

> P2: Yes. I'm not as good at this as Teams, but here we go.

Becky: No worries. Okay awesome. That was amazingly quick. So that's great. Alright. So I'll give you your first scenario. Now, again, we'll review two total scenarios in this session.

### Login scenario
Becky: So I'd like you. Oh oops all of my screens. Just minimize. Okay, I'd like you to pretend that you're a Veteran, and you're having trouble creating an account on VA.gov.

Becky: So you're trying to create a Login.gov account. But Login.gov doesn't let you use your passport as a form of identification. However, you don't have your driver's license or any other forms of identification. You've you've recently lost your driver's license. So that's why you're using your passport.

Becky: So starting on this page, the one you have open right now, can you show me how you would find help for this scenario? And as you're showing me, just tell me what you're thinking and noticing, too, on the page. And yeah, that's the scenario.

> P2: I think this is a very. It seems like my my chain of thought is, it's kind of a specific request again, so I probably would not use the chat Bot. Knowing the functionality of the chat bot.

 > P2: I would not go to the call us, because I don't. I don't want to do that. One thing that does that stick out to me is the frequently asked questions. So I might look there to see if there are any topics that might be helpful how to use VA.gov to manage your benefits, it might be there.

> P2: So I would probably click. Don't you just go ahead and click around. Is that okay?

Becky: Go ahead and interact. 

> P2:  Okay, so I probably click in here. And it was the id me, was that the one or which? Which? Which one am I trying.

Becky: Yeah, you're trying to create an account with Login.gov, but you can't use your passport. That's the scenario or the problem right now.

> P2: Okay, so I don't know, so maybe it would be signing into VA.gov. Issues with signing in. I see here. What if I don't have... It doesn't really give me the information here that I'd be looking for.

> P2: I might look under problems. Try and do a search. 'logging in.' Oh, by the way, typing in front of people is my biggest fear.

Becky: It's all good.

> P2: So see if that gives me anything problem long again. I don't know if it will. Issues with, you know, it's kind of issues of signing in. But it doesn't really say. And this is not going very quickly. Starting again. Try that again.

> P2: Looks like it's locked on my side, which doesn't really surprise me.

Becky: Yeah, no worries while we're while this page is loading. Some follow-up questions for me. So you know you, it seems like you gravitated towards the FAQ link, first on the Contact us page. 

> P2: 


*Would you expect to see this type of support on this type of website? -I would because it’s a login issue/creating a login account, it's before the login on the page since I can't get to the other side. I would think there would be something more of a discussion of identification. I know if I tried to use the Ask VA, I would go there. 
*What do you think the Ask online means? -That would be through the secure messaging system.
*Do you know what other Other Resources might be? -Might be a one-page with picture document, but I can’t think of other resources that isn’t covered in the FAQ.
I might look to helpful online tools. Looking at it, I don’t think it has anything I’m looking for. 
*What would you add? -Online web forms. Electronic forms that I would of filled out on paper before
*How would you decide which phone number to call? -I wouldn't use the TTY, it’s not a benefits or GI question, not a health website. I could look in other helpful numbers. I might click in the full list of numbers, but I might call the 411 number. 
To put a Contact Us or phone number on the front page, it might be helpful. Then I wouldn’t have to call this 411 number that is very dreadful. ]
### Claims scenario
[I would start with Chatbot. I feel like the Chatbot might have some things that it can do here. I would start chat and type increase for a disability rating. I think I need claims information, how to file a disability claim, I can submit a claim based on conditions I already have. I think I can file for compensation online. 
*How do you look for that information? I would click on eligibility, am I eligible, I would go back to this disability benefits page. I’m not sure where I’m going here. 
*Would you start on the Contact Us page? I would have gone to my ratings page. ]
*What other channels would you go to? I would give Chatbot another chance. I would have used Reddit before or even searched Google. 
## Review each scenario
[The answer you found, seems hidden. The other one is, maybe because it’s internal, can’t transfer you to another place, a warm handoff- I hate that I would have to dial a new number instead of transferring. That’s a process that can be improved. I know its hard if it's even possible. ]

## Cool down
[What did you like or dislike? It’s set up the way I would expect. Contact Us gives me enough to know. The way it’s set up is the way I would go. My feedback is that the general information line has the helpful numbers first. My VA 411, other helpful numbers, and everything else below that. The other helpful online tools, I don’t see that as related to everything else. I don’t know how that is more helpful than the other numbers. I don’t see the connection with everything else and the grey box.]
