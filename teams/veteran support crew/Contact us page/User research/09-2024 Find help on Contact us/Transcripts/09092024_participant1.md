## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: Alright, so it seems like we're ready to get started. And first, I'd just like to begin learning a bit more with your experience with VA customer support. And so how long have you been a veteran?

> P1: I've been a Veteran for nearly 40 years. So from when I first enlisted, and I've been retired for 9 years.

Becky: And in your time as as a Veteran, so far, have you ever used the Contact us page on VA.gov?

> P1: Oh yes.

Becky: Great. Can you walk me through like, maybe a recent experience you've had with using the page?

> P1: Very unproductive is the VA has partnered with Login.gov and ID Me for their verification updates. Unfortunately, they made it sound like it would happen after the 1st of the year, January 2025. But they've already started to implement. They've already firewalled off certain pages on the VA without warning or notification. I won't go into all the details. Why, I can't meet the requirements for either Login.gov or ID me.

> P1: And I've probably had 40 emails with Id Me. And every single session with them is, well, contact the people at your agency. Aka, VA. Everybody wants to send me back to the VA. As if they think that there's some simple person to reach out and contact about this process.

> P1: I've gone through page after page between, you know, webmasters, whatever anything I could find to where there's anybody that is paying any attention to what's going on, and there simply isn't. And I haven't had any response to that. 

Becky:  Got it. So it sounds like, maybe I'm reading between the lines here a bit. So let me know if this sounds right. Bu twere you able to find the contact information you were needing? Or are you still at a point where you don't know who to contact?

> P1: I can't, both, could not find anybody that because, you know, I get all the regular VA emails. Aware that they would be transitioning eventually to ID me. But I went back through all the old emails looking for points of contact, went through the website looking for somebody that is specifically becauseI'm a tech guy. And I've been with ID me for years. And they just arbitrarily started deactivating accounts because they decide they need a higher level of verification with the VA. Now than they ever did before.

> P1: Now I live overseas, and this is affecting hundreds, if not thousands, of other Veterans that have not, I haven't been back. I haven't lived in the US In over 20 years. I got sent overseas shortly after 9/11. And so it's caused problems for me. It's caused problems for other Veterans, and we've discussed this at length.

> P1: How many of stuff of us are having problems with both in Logiv.gov. And now ID me. And them ignoring all of our complaints and saying, go, talk to the VA. And when we say who do you suggest? Because you're the partners with the VA. Not me. I'm low man on the pole. So you tell me your technical contact is with the VA to iron this out, because now we're having people that did get validated Id me accounts, and they still have problems not being able to log in. And again, we don't know who at the VA is addressing these specific complaints.

> P1: Because you just get all the routine, if you try and find any information about it. It's just a promotional message that oh, these are our partners, and we'll be doing this next year. Well, no, they're doing it now, and so yeah, it's just been very frustrating trying to find what office is even responsible for this. And it doesn't, because it doesn't seem to fall under anybody right now, because technically, it wasn't supposed to be implemented yet. 

Becky: Yeah, I'm I'm really sorry to hear that it sounds like, you know, you're really trying to make the effort to you know, follow the right steps. But maybe that that information isn't as easily available on on VA.gov as it as it should be right now. And I guess I'm curious in your experience, too, ahat sort of support channels did you try to find first? Was it phone email, or like articles. What was your step?

> P1: Well, first was, I said, I pulled up all, did a search of all my VA emails that had the term Login.gov, or ID me. There were no, you know, more questions or more information. There were links that were just basically promotional pages talking about it, and how easy it was. And just here's our partners redirect.

> P1: But everything was always pushing you back to those 2 partner sites, but nothing within the VA website saying, oh, and you know, if you're still using a CAC card or your DS Logon, or your previous ID me logon. The only thing we can do is once again. We'll just send you over to DS Logon. We'll send you over to your agency's, you know, CAC Administration and again, like I said, I already had an ID me account, and they just say, oh, well, you just need to go through and reverify. Oh, sorry you're not eligible anymore.

> P1: So yeah, so couldn't find anything in the emails. Couldn't find anything in the promotional information all the anything you click on within the web page always sent you back to another promotional message and redirected you to ID me or Login.gov. And and even like Login.gov, when you've gone through every potential option they give you to fix.

> P1: The last one you're presented with is, go to your local post office. It's only post offices in the Continental United States. So even though we have military post USPS, postal service stations overseas, they haven't even identified that as being an option, and that's the only that is literally the last option available to anybody living overseas is to go to the nearest military base. Go to the USPS. Uou know. It's the Military Operated Office in USPS to go there, but they they know nothing about this program at all, so we can't even get it verified in person anywhere.

We can’t get anything verified anywhere. In-person, they have never heard of it. I talked to the US Postmaster and they have never seen any advisory and are unfamiliar with VA.gov. No body saw it coming.]

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[I would hit Contact us link. I hate chatbot. I refused to sit and wait and be held hostage. Chatbot is a question, and then you’ll wait 5- 10 minutes. My experience with them is infuriating. You don’t want to hear my questions, you want me to change my questions- give keywords and then it has an answer to that. Call Us, I don’t like because I will have to be up early and then I’ll be on the call 30-40 minutes and depending on if I get a helpful person. I might go to FAQ’s like if I lost my drivers lisence. 
*What would you expect if you clicked Contact Us online? -Contact Us form with a bunch of dropdowns and probably give you a couple of options before you submit. I expect a detailed Contact Us form. 
What I would want to know is, before calling, what is expected from us to bring. 

*Without that information, who would you choose what phone number to call?  -I’m old school, I would call the 24/7. The other phone numbers are not applicable. I would fill out a form, webmail form first, then it prompts you to a number you might call.]
### Claims scenario
[I know the benefits section is a completely different animal. I’m going to scroll down through this VA stuff, top section. I see the first VA benefits hotline but I’m going to keep scrolling. Now, I’m confused because they’re three separate numbers. I will go back to VA health benefits hotline.
What would you do next if you didn’t get your answer there? -Assuming that I already had that signed in active account, and I can quickly narrow down what department of the VA.

*What would you expect differently if you were logged in? - I will go to Contact Us and see if there is anything and if not, I will go back to the previous page and see if there is a link. 
I’m a tab guy, I would click the next tab. I expect to sign-in on VA.gov. 

*Would you click anywhere else for this scenario? -For this particular scenario, no.]

## Review each scenario
[I would, HIPPA has ruined society. Not even parents can get information on their kids. You can’t jump any hoops to prove your identity. There is no one over the phone that will talk to me about my case without verification of identity.]

## Cool down
[We had a lot of issues with so many numbers, no plus signs, no dashes and so, many of these folks have no idea how many characters are allotted and there’s no proper notification. Wish we just had a format on what it should be. It’s a wild guess to see which one works. Two of the most common complaints; are phone number formatting and postal formatting.

TIME OVER

-Please go back to the folks who are working with the verification process for those who had accounts with the VA, I did that in person. Everyone that was 50 or 60 should have been grandfathered. What's missing from the page that you were previously on, It must be end date to be valid. US Code 81, I believe, they are sitting, miss-quoting it for the US military ID cards. We are all mandated to get these Caq cards but they are being refused as a form of identification.]
