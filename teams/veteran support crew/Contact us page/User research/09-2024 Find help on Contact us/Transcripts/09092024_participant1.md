## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: Alright, so it seems like we're ready to get started. And first, I'd just like to begin learning a bit more with your experience with VA customer support. And so how long have you been a veteran?

> P1: I've been a Veteran for nearly [number] years. So from when I first enlisted, and I've been retired for [number] years.

Becky: And in your time as as a Veteran, so far, have you ever used the Contact us page on VA.gov?

> P1: Oh yes.

Becky: Great. Can you walk me through like, maybe a recent experience you've had with using the page?

> P1: Very unproductive is the VA has partnered with Login.gov and ID Me for their verification updates. Unfortunately, they made it sound like it would happen after the 1st of the year, January 2025. But they've already started to implement. They've already firewalled off certain pages on the VA without warning or notification. I won't go into all the details. Why, I can't meet the requirements for either Login.gov or ID me.

> P1: And I've probably had 40 emails with Id Me. And every single session with them is, well, contact the people at your agency. Aka, VA. Everybody wants to send me back to the VA. As if they think that there's some simple person to reach out and contact about this process.

> P1: I've gone through page after page between, you know, webmasters, whatever anything I could find to where there's anybody that is paying any attention to what's going on, and there simply isn't. And I haven't had any response to that. 

Becky:  Got it. So it sounds like, maybe I'm reading between the lines here a bit. So let me know if this sounds right. Bu twere you able to find the contact information you were needing? Or are you still at a point where you don't know who to contact?

> P1: I can't, both, could not find anybody that because, you know, I get all the regular VA emails. Aware that they would be transitioning eventually to ID me. But I went back through all the old emails looking for points of contact, went through the website looking for somebody that is specifically becauseI'm a tech guy. And I've been with ID me for years. And they just arbitrarily started deactivating accounts because they decide they need a higher level of verification with the VA. Now than they ever did before.

> P1: Now I live overseas, and this is affecting hundreds, if not thousands, of other Veterans that have not, I haven't been back. I haven't lived in the US In over 20 years. I got sent overseas shortly after 9/11. And so it's caused problems for me. It's caused problems for other Veterans, and we've discussed this at length.

> P1: How many of stuff of us are having problems with both in Logiv.gov. And now ID me. And them ignoring all of our complaints and saying, go, talk to the VA. And when we say who do you suggest? Because you're the partners with the VA. Not me. I'm low man on the pole. So you tell me your technical contact is with the VA to iron this out, because now we're having people that did get validated Id me accounts, and they still have problems not being able to log in. And again, we don't know who at the VA is addressing these specific complaints.

> P1: Because you just get all the routine, if you try and find any information about it. It's just a promotional message that oh, these are our partners, and we'll be doing this next year. Well, no, they're doing it now, and so yeah, it's just been very frustrating trying to find what office is even responsible for this. And it doesn't, because it doesn't seem to fall under anybody right now, because technically, it wasn't supposed to be implemented yet. 

Becky: Yeah, I'm I'm really sorry to hear that it sounds like, you know, you're really trying to make the effort to you know, follow the right steps. But maybe that that information isn't as easily available on on VA.gov as it as it should be right now. And I guess I'm curious in your experience, too, ahat sort of support channels did you try to find first? Was it phone email, or like articles. What was your step?

> P1: Well, first was, I said, I pulled up all, did a search of all my VA emails that had the term Login.gov, or ID me. There were no, you know, more questions or more information. There were links that were just basically promotional pages talking about it, and how easy it was. And just here's our partners redirect.

> P1: But everything was always pushing you back to those 2 partner sites, but nothing within the VA website saying, oh, and you know, if you're still using a CAC card or your DS Logon, or your previous ID me logon. The only thing we can do is once again. We'll just send you over to DS Logon. We'll send you over to your agency's, you know, CAC Administration and again, like I said, I already had an ID me account, and they just say, oh, well, you just need to go through and reverify. Oh, sorry you're not eligible anymore.

> P1: So yeah, so couldn't find anything in the emails. Couldn't find anything in the promotional information all the anything you click on within the web page always sent you back to another promotional message and redirected you to ID me or Login.gov. And and even like Login.gov, when you've gone through every potential option they give you to fix.

> P1: The last one you're presented with is, go to your local post office. It's only post offices in the Continental United States. So even though we have military post USPS, postal service stations overseas, they haven't even identified that as being an option, and that's the only that is literally the last option available to anybody living overseas is to go to the nearest military base. Go to the USPS. Uou know. It's the Military Operated Office in USPS to go there, but they they know nothing about this program at all, so we can't even get it verified in person anywhere.

Becky: Oh, so when, you, so it sounds like when you've gone to the military base for that last in-person option, they don't know. 

> P1: Never. They've never heard of it, and they have nobody to contact, because, you know, you pull up the webpage on your phone and you show them how this one shows, and and they've never heard of it.

> P1: I talked to the postmaster at the station. He gets all the advisories from the USPS, because it's USPS and then MPS, so it's the MPS, is the military you know, agent form. So they've never seen an advisory. Never heard about it. Completely unfamiliar with Login.gov as a whole, let alone that they're the only authorized agent for in-person verifications. And so yeah, no, nobody, nobody saw it coming.

> P1: I used to have this mantra in the military. I always did as a supervisor education before implementation. That was my mantra, and that's what they've done is they went ahead and implemented it last month. And all these people is, I'm, you know. I'm [age], and I'm a young buck among the retirees. But I'm also, you know, the calm guy. So I'm trying to help people, you know, techno with technical troubleshooting all these workarounds, even just to help them get it, ID me, and see if they can do a video verification.

> P1: But like I said. We've ruled out Login.gov is not an option for any of us, because Post Office is the last option that doesn't work. Nobody's thought about it yet.

> P1: And you know, maybe tweaking their browsers, trying some other options, where again, even the ones that got video verified with ID me still doesn't work, so I'm walking them through. I'll try this browser, and, you know, disable this and clear that, and they still can't logged in, and there's no nobody to turn to, because ID me when they say, Hey, id me! I'm using you to authenticate, and I'm just caught in this endless loop.

> P1: I have also, I have every remote tech support app there is, and I've watched them, and you just see them get caught in this endless loop of trying to authenticate. Get kicked. Kick back. ID me. Go back to VA get kicked back to ID me. Yeah, it's just it's been hopeless.

Becky: Yeah, no. And you know, I really appreciate this feedback, even outside of just the Contact us page. I know we we've been talking about login and authentication to within our office. So I will, we'll definitely share this feedback with, you know the folks that are involved with that process right now. But yeah, it's really kind of you to help, you know your fellow Veterans who are also living abroad, since you seem to have, just unfortunately, a lot of experience with trying to find the right contact information. Yeah. I'll continue moving us along. But we will go through a scenario that maybe is relevant to your experiences with login, and I'll go through that right now.

## Scenarios
Becky: In the rest of the session. I'm going to give you 2 scenarios where you, as a veteran, would reach out to VA for help. So you know, I'd just like to imagine that you're a Veteran in these 2 scenarios. And these are actually real questions that Veterans asked us this year, just reworded.

Becky: So before you do that, I'm going to send a link to the current Contact us page on VA.gov. Yes, in the chat. So let me know when you've received that, and if you can open the link in the chat.

> P1: Okay, I've got that open in Google Chrome.

Becky: Now, second question, have you shared your screen on Zoom before?

> P1: : Yes. But let me see. I have multiple browsers. So yeah.

Becky: Now you can choose the right window, so you don't share your whole screen. And let me know if you need help with that.

> P1: I've been playing in Microsoft Teams for the past 2 weeks. Where do we have it here on Zoom?

Becky: Yes, in Zoom it'll be that green share button. Yes. Yeah, no worries. It's funny how it's very obvious, but not not obvious enough sometimes.

> P1: Got it

Becky: Amazing. Alright. Now let me expand my screen. Okay, now I can see your whole screen. Great. And I'll walk you through our first scenario, which is actually a login scenario.

### Login scenario
Becky: So I'd like you to pretend that you're a Veteran who can't create an account on VA.gov. You are trying to create a Login.gov account. But Login.gov doesn't let you use your passport as a form of identification. And you just don't have your driver's license because you lost it recently. But you still need to create an account.

Becky: So, starting on the Contact us page, which is the page you're on right now show me how you would find help for this scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing on this page.

Becky: I'll also send this scenario in the chat. So you have it readily on hand in case you need to refer to it. So yeah, again, walk through the page. Tell me how you would try to find help for creating an account for VA.gov, when you only have a passport. You don't have your driver's license.

> P1: Let me, I gotta move my screen around a little bit. Here. Okay, yeah, I just want to say it's when you were talking about, so I can see the chat. I don't see, okay? And they didn't. So I just said, Oh, that's in a group, couldn't imagine somebody trying to do this on a mobile phone or, cause I've got a, so I've got the chat window open separately. And then I've got your video open up in the corner there.

> P1: Okay, back to the screen.

> P1: so just initial, my initial response is, Contact us online through Va, well. I want to see what else, I hate chat bots.

Becky: Sorry. Pausing there. Can you tell me a little bit more about the hate for chat bots?

> P1: Number one, is just because I've been trying them since they were first invented is, I refuse to sit and wait, held hostage by chat bot!

> P1: So it's just kind of like every time I go to walk away. It's like, you know, do you get a repeat of the exact same question. But it's basically what should be if it was a live agent question. Answer, question, answer, chat bot is question, go ahead and start dinner as it could be. 15, 10 min before it comes back.

> P1: And again I know chat bots have advanced considerably. But it seems even what they do now is simulating engagement by just front loading you, whatever it can.

> P1: You know. Do to make you feel like, oh, I'm being there. It's being responsive, and it's helping me, and my experience with them is they just, just a little infuriating, because it's just like, Oh, you want me to keep you. You don't want you don't want to hear my question. You want me to ask the question that matches the answers. So it keeps on trying to change my initial inquiry into here, let me throw some keywords at you, and if any of these keywords work for me, I've got an answer for that.

> P1: So it's like it doesn't necessarily want to try and interpret my question, or I didn't have the right keywords the way I phrased it. So it's kind of like, you know, leading me down this path, that well, I'm going to give you an answer that I already have, because I had this team put together 87 pre-formatted responses. And we're going to force you to accept one of those 87 answers, and we'll try and get as close as we can. So that's why, initially, I'll ignore the chat bot




Call Us, I don’t like because I will have to be up early and then I’ll be on the call 30-40 minutes and depending on if I get a helpful person. I might go to FAQ’s like if I lost my drivers lisence. 
*What would you expect if you clicked Contact Us online? -Contact Us form with a bunch of dropdowns and probably give you a couple of options before you submit. I expect a detailed Contact Us form. 
What I would want to know is, before calling, what is expected from us to bring. 

*Without that information, who would you choose what phone number to call?  -I’m old school, I would call the 24/7. The other phone numbers are not applicable. I would fill out a form, webmail form first, then it prompts you to a number you might call.]
### Claims scenario
[I know the benefits section is a completely different animal. I’m going to scroll down through this VA stuff, top section. I see the first VA benefits hotline but I’m going to keep scrolling. Now, I’m confused because they’re three separate numbers. I will go back to VA health benefits hotline.
What would you do next if you didn’t get your answer there? -Assuming that I already had that signed in active account, and I can quickly narrow down what department of the VA.

*What would you expect differently if you were logged in? - I will go to Contact Us and see if there is anything and if not, I will go back to the previous page and see if there is a link. 
I’m a tab guy, I would click the next tab. I expect to sign-in on VA.gov. 

*Would you click anywhere else for this scenario? -For this particular scenario, no.]

## Review each scenario
[I would, HIPPA has ruined society. Not even parents can get information on their kids. You can’t jump any hoops to prove your identity. There is no one over the phone that will talk to me about my case without verification of identity.]

## Cool down
[We had a lot of issues with so many numbers, no plus signs, no dashes and so, many of these folks have no idea how many characters are allotted and there’s no proper notification. Wish we just had a format on what it should be. It’s a wild guess to see which one works. Two of the most common complaints; are phone number formatting and postal formatting.

TIME OVER

-Please go back to the folks who are working with the verification process for those who had accounts with the VA, I did that in person. Everyone that was 50 or 60 should have been grandfathered. What's missing from the page that you were previously on, It must be end date to be valid. US Code 81, I believe, they are sitting, miss-quoting it for the US military ID cards. We are all mandated to get these Caq cards but they are being refused as a form of identification.]
