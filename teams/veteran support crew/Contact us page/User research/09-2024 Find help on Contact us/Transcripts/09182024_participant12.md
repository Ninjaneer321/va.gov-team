## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: And it looks like now we are ready to get started.

> P12: OK, Yeah.

Becky: And first, I'd like to learn more just about your experience with VA and VA customer support. So to start off, around how long have you been a veteran?

> P12: Oh, I enlisted in [year] in the United States Marine Corps and served [number] years active and [number] years inactive.

> P12: But obviously as a public school teacher, I wasn't eligible for VA benefits of any kind. OK, so I've only been, I was given VA medical benefits because I was a Marine stated at Camp Lejeune with the Water Act passed by Congress.

> P12: So once that became available, then I initially just kind of made some contacts. And the more experiences I had, the more positive I was. And short little note, to be honest, if I didn't have a wife, I'd probably use the VA exclusively, especially before I was [number].

> P12: I'm [number] now, but before I was [number], I retired at [number]. So there are some really expensive healthcare programs that you have to pay for until you get on Medicare. So, you know, you're not going to hear a lot of complaints from me about the VA.

> P12: I'll be honest. So I was in private medical care until Congress made me eligible. And then I slowly moved over different parts of my medical care to the VA to the point where virtually everything I do now is through the VA.

Becky: Yeah. That's really good to hear. You know, while while it is helpful to hear, you know, those negative experiences as well, I'm glad in your case, you know, it seems like things have have been working out pretty well. I'm curious...

> P12:  And also I will say the only negative is occasionally if things take too long.

[P12 discusses a health care experience.]

Becky: Yeah, no technology is really amazing nowadays, and I'm glad you know, doctors at VA are utilizing that. I'm curious in your experiences, too. So it sounds like you use VA mostly for health benefits.

Becky: And so have you have ever had the experience of maybe not knowing who to contact for something and then trying to look up contact information on our website before?

> P12: Yes. And generally what I have found is the easiest thing to do is I have one person, [name], I think his, I think I forget his name.

> P12: But in my emails when I go online, I see, I see a list of people I can contact. If I have to contact the pharmacy, ask a pharmacist, they may they reply.
 
> P12: But almost everything else, if I want something, I almost always just jot a note to the nurse and say, hey, I've got a weird question, what do I do about this?

> P12: They're very quick about replying, getting, you know, the weird things when you try to get like an eye appointment or something.

> P12: I don't know how effective the scheduling of that is, but they eventually have to call you back anyway. But no, they're always good about letting me know my own ignorance of a particular avenue that I've never been to.

[P12 discusses health care experience.]

> P12: But anyway, things like that, when you don't know what to do and you call somebody, you sometimes get an odd answer. But generally I'm very happy with them working out.

> P12: You know, me sending them a note to my primary care at the VA and them just saying, oh, you got to do this. And sometimes they're not on my list still of people I'm allowed to e-mail. It's not like we have a directory of anybody we can e-mail. We only get, we get a pull down menu on the website.

> P12: When you wanna slip a message, you get a pull down menu that says you can, you know, cardiology or pharmacy or whatever.

> P12: So generally, if I don't know who to call, I just call the main guy and they tell me.

Becky: Yeah. It sounds like, you know, you've been talking about, I think. Are you talking about VA secure messaging, like the messaging?

> P12: Yes. 

Becky: OK, great. I just wanted to confirm, but no, that that's great. I'm wondering, do you ever try to look for answers online first or do you go straight to maybe trying to contact someone?

> P12: No, I, I mean, I've explored the website. I used to design websites years ago. I mean, I've been on the Internet since [year]. So I mean published on it and things like that.

> P12: So I'm, I'm actually kind of fascinated with what things work well and what things don't. I would say I, I do some exploring, but I will say it's easier just to, you know, if I know I don't know the answer and I'm not just fooling around on the, on the website, it's easier to just ask somebody.
 
> P12: You know, it's like a plumbing problem. I had no school. I was a history teacher. So I have a plumbing problem. I'm beyond trying to fix it. I used to do that.

> P12: I had a few family, you know, plumbing was like something to explore, but, you know, it's just so easy because they're in it every day and they know what you're, you're not the first veteran who had that question. That's my thought.
 
> P12: So, yeah. And they're always so helpful. I I mean, they respond immediately if I, I mean, sometimes I'll be on a Saturday or Sunday and I'll send a note. Pharmacist works on Saturdays and replies right away.

> P12: My, my guy, [location] or whatever time they get to work, it's like I get a response and I need to see somebody and they're like, we'll call you and get you set up. So I have no complaints there.

Becky: Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That, that totally makes sense, especially if you can expect a good response from what you're using right now.
 
> P12: Right.

Becky: And maybe one final thing I wanted to ask before we move into some scenarios we'll go through is what information do you usually expect on a contact us page? What do you think you might find on a page that you know it?

> P12: It's like that contact information page on websites. The things I really want to know immediately are, is somebody going to get back to me soon? So in other words, if your hours are 8:00 to 5:00 Monday through Friday, then I won't expect to reply on Saturday.

> P12: But I have found, like with the pharmacy, there's somebody working there not 24/7, but there's somebody working there on Saturdays because they totally respond. So I'm like, oh, that's cool. I don't think they work on Sundays, but yeah, ours are a phone number.

> P12: If I really needed something, I, I fortunately, other than the stroke, I haven't had an emergency need that that quickly.

> P12: And, and to me, this is going to sound arrogant and I don't mean to sound arrogant, but I worked hard and I made enough money that if it's an emergency, I honestly don't care who's going to pay for it. Does that make sense?

> P12: Like there's no doubt that one of the reasons I'm using the VA is that frequently they pay for everything or they, you know, [name] [number] a month.

> P12: It cost me 8 through the VA. So not to use the VA pharmacy would be stupid. So on the other hand, if I can't breathe, I'm calling the life squad.

> P12: I'm not going to wait for the VA to find out whether it's covered or not because it doesn't matter to me. I want to stay alive.

> P12: So I may be in a different situation, which I don't like to say that, but I may be in a different situation that I'm not as bound by the restrictions of I have to use the VA, I don't have to use the VA, I use the VA because it's convenient, it's less expensive, and they seem to do as good or better work than anybody in the private sector.

[P12 talks baout health experience.]

Becky: Yeah, yeah, that does make sense. And it's really helpful to hear your your thought process through, you know, using your benefits too. So yeah, thanks for explaining some of those experiences with the A so far.

> P12: Sure.

## Scenarios
Becky: All right. Well, we'll move into the next part of the session. And I'll, I'm going to give you 2 scenarios where you, as a veteran would reach out to VA for help. And these scenarios are actually real questions that veterans asked us this year. They've just been reworded.

Becky: All right. So before we do that, though, I will send a link to our current contact Us page on va.gov and let me know when you've opened that and it shouldn't be in your chat.

[P12 screen shares.]

### Claims scenario
Becky: All right, so we can pause for a second here while I give you your first scenario.

> P12: All right.

Becky: All right. So in this case, you're a veteran and you currently get disability compensation for some shoulder pain. And you noticed your shoulder has been hurting more in the past couple of months, but you don't know if you can request more compensation than you're getting right now for this worsening pain.

Becky: So starting on this page, show me how you would find help for this scenario. And as you're showing me, tell me what you're thinking and noticing too.

> P12: Well, in looking at this page, I would probably first ask the chatbot a question because I find that fascinating because the tech, I'm a tech guy.

> P12: So because I did actually ask about this disability compensation for [condition]. And I was actually told by my, and, and I will tell you what exactly what I did.

> P12:I sent an E as I told you I do. I sent a note to my primary care. He's not a physician. I think he's a physician physician, but I'm in one team. So I sent it to the team and said is that something you can answer?

> P12: And she said no. We only deal with if you have a medical problem. There's a separate section for compensation. Here's the phone number. You should call them and they will have access to your files.

> P12: So I don't want to say I know the answer to the question, but I have recently asked that question of the VA and that's what I did.

Becky: So no, that that's helpful to hear that experience. So it sounds like they couldn't answer your question, but they were able to redirect you to maybe a different phone number you could call, right?

> P12: That that's what led me to they made a, they made an appointment for me for the [condition] and I sent them copies of all my recent [health info].

> P12: He looked them over. Then he did a video conference with me. I have not followed up yet with the people in charge of compensation. I have another meeting with him in the middle of [month] after [number] days with his new settings, and I was kind of waiting for that, to be honest.

Becky: Yeah, I'm curious. Maybe we'll learn something new here. But do you want to go ahead and click the chat bot link and and see and go through this as as you're in the scenario? So you said you'd use the chat bot and yeah, just show me what you'd do next.

> P12: I would click on learn about the chat bot, start the chat.

Becky: OK. 

> P12: And then it was I would say can my disability payment slash level be changed because I am in more pain.

> P12: And then I would to clarify, did you mean claims information ratings, I think it's called your rating depending on what you, you need to sign in to see your disability, you'd like to sign in now. So then I would sign in.

Becky: OK, Yeah. And why would you sign in at this point because it says would you like to do that?

> P12: So I would assume that's going to take me to see the disability ratings and maybe I can read something that would say depending.
 
> P12: I don't know what the disability is for a sore shoulder, but maybe it would say if your pain levels increase. I don't think they would. But like I said, it seemed to be easier just to e-mail the VA and they would say Nope. For compensation. You got to talk to these people. Here's their phone number, call them.

[If I can’t figure it out by reading this, I would go to VA.gov and type this link is not working. It’s almost like the VA has tried to change how to log in for the past three years. I don’t like that there is numerous ways to log in. If I choose VA Health, it gives me three choices to log in, I used My HealtheVet because it’s easier to do it.
It’s a 10 minute drive, I would just drive there and get help. I wouldn’t spend hours and hours on the internet. I don’t think I would dial the 1800 instead of driving to my clinic because they are always helpful. I couldn’t be happier with the quality care I’m getting at the VA. Finding a VA in Florida is very easy. I have done some exploration of the website and we aren’t ready to move to Florida but there’s a lot of VA’s in Florida. 
*Can you show me? – Typed Venice FL (Find VA location). This page doesn’t tell you if I had an emergency, it doesn’t tell you where I need to go. 
They don’t say this, I thought when I got VA care, I thought they would treat what I have and sometimes you pay and sometimes you don’t.]

### Login scenario
[I would as Chatbot the question because I find that fascinating and I’m a tech guy. For example, I sent a note to my Team and asked them if is that something they could answer, there's a separate section for compensation, here is the number.
I would click Learn about the Chatbot, start the chat, then I would sign in. I would sign because it says if I would like to do that and see my disability rating. It seems it would be easier to email the VA and them to respond, “Here is a list of numbers on where to call”. No one can know everything, but my PA’s teams seem to know where to redirect me.
*What step would you take next to get your answer? -I would contact my primary care and I have never been unhappy at how they do that. I would sign into my VA account and send a secure message. 
How would you go back to find that link? I would not search the VA. I can click on the VA app and explore]



## Review each scenario
[I like that in red it says, “this is required”.
*Any thoughts on the Chatbot? -No, I’m familiar with how they work. It’s a good place to start. 
It’s irritating that I’ll be on my computer and it will ask me for my phone for the multifactor. ]

## Cool down
[A way to get to your local directory if there were such a thing. In terms of Contact Us, I just contact my Team, it just works out better for me that way.]
