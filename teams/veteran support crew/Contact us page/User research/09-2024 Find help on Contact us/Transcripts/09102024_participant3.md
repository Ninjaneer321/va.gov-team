## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
[I’ve been a Veteran since 2010. 
*Have you used Contact Us? -Yes.
The last time I was on VA.gov when I was looking for a VA in Spokane, WA. It was easy. I typed in the search. I hot Spokane, WA and it pulled up the two locations closest to it. 
*Do you ever try to find answers online first? -Yes. Search bar is my favorite thing. The most common thing I look up is the travel page. I normally tell other Veterans to go to VA.gov and go to search.]

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[I’m scanning for a contact for online support. The closest thing I see is my Health help desk. I would go through contact us through online Ask VA. It’s usually a chat or frequently asked questions. I would start message without signing in because I don’t have a sign in.
Chatbots are not my favorite thing, I don’t want to wait for an email to get an answer back. 
*Why not use Chatbot? -Because you get a bunch of responses before you get one thing.
*Why don’t you call your local VA? -The wait to even talk to a person. You sit in there for a while and you sit and wait.
*Have you used this method before (Ask VA)? -No. I would hope to have a response within 24 hours.]
*Do you think you would be able to find a number? -I would go to, Find VA near you. Because we were talking about appointments and it’s not urgent, I chose VA health. For me, as you can see are all about 45 minutes to me. My main care is at W.G Hefner, and they are a bigger facility.]
*Why did you choose Login.gov? -That’s the first one that came to mind. 
*Would you expect to see this type of link or support in this Contact Us page? I would expect to see it on the FAQ that is on the Contact Us page.
*What would you expect from FAQ links? - I would hope, an actual person or an email
### Claims scenario
[ Here is the VA benefits hotline number. I would click on check your VA claim or appeal status.
*Is there a reason you would try and find a number on there? That’s only is it was within the hours they were closed. I’m looking for an email. I can click on this Claims status and see if there is anything I can add. If it’s in the middle of the night, there’s no one to talk to and I would click FAQ’s.
*Are you familiar with the VA benefits hotline? -No. I never used it.
I would click on VA articles, none of them answered that question, I would go back and see if I missed something. 
*As a final result? -I would call.]

## Review each scenario
[Key words are important when doing a search. It’s odd to me that Login and ID are two different processes.
If you’re a Chatbot person, I’m glad it’s there.]

## Cool down
[I like that it was easy to find the phone numbers. I like that it was split up and not one general number.
*Anything that could of been easier? -For me, no. Maybe for other Vets that are not tech savvy, might be difficult but it’s easier than what it used to be.]
