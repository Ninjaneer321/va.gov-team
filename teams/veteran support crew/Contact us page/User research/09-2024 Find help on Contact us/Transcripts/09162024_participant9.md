## Before showing ‘Contact us’ page
Becky: Well, it seems like we're ready to get started and first, we're just gonna take some time to learn more about your experience with VA and VA customer support. So starting off around how long have you been a veteran?

> P9: We're technically a veteran with when I joined, so [number] years ago this month.

Becky: Wow. OK, Happy happy anniversary. That's quite a long time. In that time, have you ever used the contact us page on va.gov?

> P9: Yes, I want to say two years ago was the last time I did when they went to the new I think it was log on dot, log on dot, ID whatever was called the new format.

> P9: I was part of a test part for that to do, trying to work on it and to get the ID, ID to work.

> P9: But it after the session it didn't work. And then I kept trying to contact the VA through Contact us and then try to get that that log in to work again and I still haven't gotten it to work right since.

> P9: So I have to use other logins other than the new version of it that they have.

Becky: Oh, interesting. OK. How did you try to contact the VA in that instance?

> P9: So I clicked on the link on the website and then 'cause I tried to do first, you know, reset your IP, you know, getting a new password and everything else, trying to go through the process, but it's got so many Dang steps.

> P9: It kept timing out and then it kept screened up. So I finally got it to try to get a phone call. So I finally got a phone call with them to try to work on it.

> P9: They said they're supposed to give me a call back and they sent me a link, but it didn't work. So I just like, it's just not worth it, worth an hour of the time.

> P9: I was, I just was waiting for the glitches to stop. Hopefully one day it would work better so I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. But still not that.

Becky: Yeah, sorry to hear about that. I know, you know, we definitely hear a lot about login issues with our veterans too, you know, even depending on if they live overseas or if they're here, that sort of thing.

Becky: I'm curious too. So you mentioned you contacted VA by phone. Is that how you usually contact VA by calling or like, do you try to do e-mail or do you have a preference?

> P9: I try to do e-mail. I try to do or anything or whichever method e-mail or like the chat if it was available, but phone's kind of last resort just cause it's, it's a hit or miss and you never know.

> P9: And I'm, I'm not in an area where the cell phone signal is the best, which is part of the problem too.

> P9: So it's always an issue, especially if you have to worry about receiving a code to your phone, stuff like that, that's always a pain.

> P9: So it just, it's just, it's a hassle. So to me, a phone, a phone call's almost a last resort.

Becky: OK, Can you explain, I guess you talked about, you know, your, your cell phone signal. Is there any other reason why it might be a last resort for you?

> P9: 'cause the people I talk to don't always necessarily know what's going on. And again, without having the best signal, it's hard to hear them. And then constantly repeat for everything else. It's just more of a hassle than than it's worth. 
 
Becky: Yeah, yes. I'm wondering do you try to find answers online first? 

> P9: Yes.

Becky: OK, how do you do that?

> P9: So if I can't find it on the website itself to the help page or I'll go to Google and then type it in there or try to find other like some of the forums I'm part of just to see if if anything, if anybody else having the same issue or how do they way to fix it.

> P9: I try I might put the question out there if it's, you know, really troublesome, but again, we don't always get quick answers there either.

> P9: So I don't really have a quick way to get anything done just because of the fact of where I live, but it is what it is.

Becky: Got it. I'm curious, can you maybe walk me through like your most recent attempt at finding answers online and, and how that went with VA or like Ava related question.

> P9: So actually we end up being, finding out what my, actually I had to get, actually last week I had to get a benefits letter to show because my my VA benefits have been updated. So I wanted to get a letter for it.

> P9: But I kept typing in for the search function on my health, the vet or my Hilda vet, whatever it is. And then on the main VA page, it wouldn't work.

> P9: So I finally had to go to Google, type in the exact same words. And gosh, it took me right to the V as link right there.

> P9: But for some reason the VA itself, the VA.gov or the My HealtheVet would not let me find that page. That's really that was very frustrating.
 
Becky: Got it. So it sounds like you are trying to use this, that search tool, but you just had to use the Google search tool which brought you to the same page anyway?

> P9: Yes, 'cause it wouldn't let me. I couldn't find it under my own, like under myself, I couldn't find claims, I couldn't find anything where it was would go specifically to those letters that I, I'd only seen the page before.

I went to the home page, my information page.]

## Scenarios
### Login scenario
[A lot more links than I would expect, which is good. I would click on the Check your VA claim or appeal. I would log in and, looking for questions on claims or benefits that shows what I would do next like on the FAQ’s page and see where I can get additional assistance. 
Without logging in, I’m at a standstill because I can’t log on. I might click “What your claim status means”. There is another link there taking me back to check your claim status. My first page, and FAQ’s from the top of my head, I thought that would be where I can find what I’m looking for.
*Why would you go to a VA Regional office vs the phone number there? -I would try to find the Regional number because the National might take me to another number instead of the Regional, which might help me find a local number. 
I don’t have a VA hospital near me, and the VA is horrible for travel claims. They refuse to give me a letter, instead, I get a travel denial letter when they are the ones that make the appointment. I have a lot of problems with dealing with any support from the VA. 
I would choose VA health, it’s not really clear, but it’s not urgent, emergency, it’s not community providers, then I would do a search, and of course, no area is found. I don’t see I have an option where I can expand the area, like 50 mile radius but I do see a map. I’m trying to click on the one result, but I can’t do anything with it even if I click on it. Now, I go to view listing but it should of taken me automatically. Great, I have the address and main number. I would call the main number and see if I can get an appointment for my shoulder.]
### Claims scenario
[Again FAQ’s to see if that would give me a closer look. Second, click, Contact us Online through VA. I’m assuming there's some sort of chat functionality and I would get a number to the right facility. I could do the Chatbot and they may give me a live person. 
I would do the FAQs first. Then Contact Us online.
We will try the Chatbot next, I see there an area it says, things Chatbot cannot do the following. I can’t sign in and I would start my message without signing in. I’m trying to click on the box to see if I can sign in and nothing is happening. I selected the question mark which I should do, I should be able to type it. Sign in and technical issues, question mark, I’m going to click on sign in.
I would do the call if this page didn’t work. I don’t like this on this page that I have to click on something and drop down that is not very clear. 
I would do the call us. I would do the VA help desk, it might help me with that. I would choose the 411 number.]

## Review each scenario
[Why is everything a drop-down except for that one, and that is very confusing, can’t do anything.
A phone call or text messaging is frustrating because I don’t have the best service and that is a limiting factor and I would not be able to get help because, through multifactor authentication, I don’t have the best cell service. I have to use my ID.me for almost everything. I’m stuck with it for now.]

## Cool down
[Map page, and putting my issues didn’t work. For the most part, it did have options and answers but not for everything. Search bars on everything would be great.]
