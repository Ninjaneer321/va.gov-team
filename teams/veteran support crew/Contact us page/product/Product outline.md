## Overview
The Contact us page ([va.gov/contact-us](va.gov/contact-us)) on VA.gov helps people get answers to questions about VA benefits and services by connecting people to the following types of customer support channels: self-service, live agent, and asynchronous agent.

## Problem Statement
We stood up the Contact us page quickly in 2020 and have made ad-hoc updates since then. It consistently gets the lowest customer satisfaction scores compared to other pages on VA.gov. As of 2024, its CSAT score is around 20%. VA.gov's overall CSAT score is around 60%. View these scores in the [VA.gov CSAT Score Dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1545882322).
Many of the responses to the feedback button and intercept surveys through Medallia are related to people’s actual customer service experience (less within our scope to improve):
> I then tried to call your office at the number provided, and ran into a rat maze of menu options, none of which addressed my questions or offered a "something else" option to speak with someone who could help me.

However, some of the responses are related to people’s experience with finding answers and/or contact information (more within our scope to improve):
> i tried to [find] my Diagnostic Code Breakdown Letter but could not find it. i tried using the "help" but nothing was listed, so....??

First, we’ll conduct [usability tests](link to research plan) for the current Contact us page. **Research insights will help us understand the exact challenges we should prioritize when redesigning Contact us.**

## Desired User Outcomes
-	**Self-service channels**: People can find solutions independently through resources provided by VA. 
-	**Live agent**: People can find ways to talk to a person in real-time, through calling or chatting with a live agent .
-	**Asynchronous agent**: People can find ways to send messages or questions on their own time and review responses later .
