# Research Plan for [Team, Product, Date]
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - **Sample Methodologies**: Directed interviews; ethnographic interviews; observation; card sorts; tree tests; guerilla usability testing; usability testing with low- or high-fidelity prototypes; user acceptance testing. 	
  - **Also mention:** in-person moderated, remote moderated, remote unmoderated	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	
2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)	
## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 	
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**	
## Resources	
- Project Brief: 	
*Project brief should live in the appropriate va.gov-team product folder, simply paste a link to it here*	
- Convo Guide	
*Discussion guide should live in the appropriate va.gov-team product folder, simply paste a link to it here*	
- Synthesis	
*Link to any documents used for synthesis (Mural or Realtimeboard boards, excel sheets, other data outputs, etc.)* 	
- Lessons Learned	
*Did you have any takeaways from the process of this research round that you want the team to remember for the future? Document them here.* 	
- Read-Out/Results	
  - *Read-out presentation should live in the appropriate product repo and folder; paste a link to it here.* 	
  - ** Don't forget to add a link to your research folder to the research tracker! [https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platfor
