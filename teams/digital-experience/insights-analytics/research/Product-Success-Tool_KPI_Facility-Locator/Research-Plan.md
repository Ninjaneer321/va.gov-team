# Research Plan for Insights and Analytics, Product Success Tool, KPI tracker for the Facility Locator team, March 2020

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
To learn what the facility locator team and product owners of similar team want out of a KPI tracking tool and the extent of its usefulness

2. Background: The goal of the product is to help give teams the data they need to make product decisions. Each team sets measurable KPI goals, so helping them track these goals will allow them to see and report on their successes or failures. 

3. Research questions: 
- What product decisions is the team going to make using this data? 
- What will you do with this data?
- What information is missing or is there any extra information that's not needed?

4. Hypothesis: The facility locator team will find this dashboard helpful and will use it monthly to make product decisions. 

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 
  - Directed interviews with a working MVP in Domo, remote moderated

2.	Why this method? Leverages the current work and validates if we are moving in the right direction with the product. 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? Online using zoom with screen sharing

4.	What will you be testing? A working MVP of the product with real data

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use: Zoom and Domo

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
Product stakeholders of the Facility Locator Team and product managers of similar teams

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
Recruiting existing product owners who will use this product or similar products. 

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
Next sprint

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? By the end of this sprint. 

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? about 30 minutes

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?  flexible with people's schedule's within the sprint. 


## Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker**
