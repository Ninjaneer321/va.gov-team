# Monthly Contact Center Report
**Summary:** We're pulling a monthly contact center report, but not many people are actually using it or have followed up with us on why via survey. How might we make it easier for VFS teams use contact center data to improve their products?

## Meeting 7/17/20 Notes
Questions
- How is the report being used?
- Is it being used?
- Which data is being used and which data is missing?
- How do we want it to be used for?
- What can we do to get them to use it?

How do we want it to be used?
- To update & develop products

### Strategy Proposal:
1. Let's pretend we were the VFS team and were using the current data and doing the analysis ourselves (imagine how we would use the data as a VFS team):
- What insights can we glean from the current data? What do _we_ think is missing in order to get useful insights?
- Have an analysis ready when we meet with the teams

2. Meet with the teams to get their thoughts around the work (validate our analysis in either direction)
- How can we make it easier for them to get the analysis

3. Call out the insights from the monthly report on a macro level (like the synthesis that we do on the Covid Dashboard)
Highlight what we've found in the reports
- In Slack
- In Team of Teams, or
- In a readout meeting
- Potential risks: VFS teams just use the insights and then don't dive in deeper to the Domo report

#### Other Ideas
- Stretch: How can we add the unresolved Tier 3 issues to the monthly report? 
    - "this is where we stand on the issues that are our responsibility to fix"
    
### Next Steps
- Create user story & add to Sprint 31
