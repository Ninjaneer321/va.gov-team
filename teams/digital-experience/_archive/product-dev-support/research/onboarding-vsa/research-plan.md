# Research plan
We are running multiple onboarding sessions with 3 new VSA teams. We want to understand what's working in the  onboarding process and what can be improved.

### Onboarding goals
After the onboarding process is complete, we want new teams to:

- follow VA guidelines (PR reviews, design system)
- feel empowered to contribute to VA.gov after the onboarding week (during Sprint 1)

## Hypotheses
- The VSP Product Support team is providing relevant, valuable information during the onboarding process.
- Teams will feel empowered to start their work quickly. (What is quickly?)

## KPIs

* How long does it take a team to be productive?
   * Time from onboarding to the first ticket moved to Review/QA)
   * PR reviews take less than x hours to complete


## Method
- Incorporate interviews/discussion into all onboarding kickoffs
- Using OptimalSort, survey team at the end of each onboarding session
- Emily and Layla both to be present if possible at all onboarding meetings - we can facilitate the discussion questions in each one

### Draft surveys
* [All team onboarding kickoff survey](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/questions/vsa-all-team-onboarding-0)
* [Development onboarding kickoff survery](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/questions/dev-onboarding-0)
* [UX onboarding kickoff survey](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/questions/vsa-ux-onboarding)

## Participants
Participants will be members of the first three new VSA teams:

* Global UX
* Benefits
* Authenicated Experience

## When
August 5 - 12, 2019 during the All Team, UX and Engineering, Discovery & Logistics onboarding meetings

## Team Roles
