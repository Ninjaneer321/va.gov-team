Round 2 - Research Plan for Forms Library Team on Review Page
=============================================================

June - July 2022

Background
----------

In April, the Forms Library Team initiated Veteran-facing research to learn more about the Veteran experience using the Review Page and three proposed variations. Based on their feedback, two new Review Page designs were developed.

This second round of research seeks to explore the usability of two different review pages for Veterans needing to submit forms online. Additionally, the Forms Library Team will observe how Veterans accomplish three different styles of tasks (one simple, one medium, and one complex) to determine which design is optimal for task completion.

At the conclusion of this research, the Team will also document the simple, medium, and complex form edit scenarios to inform future implementation guides for forms components.

The [product outline can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsp/teams/pst-forms-library/research/review-page-round-one/VA%20Forms%20System%20Core%20(VAFSC)%20Product%20Outline.md).

### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following objectives:
1.  Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2.  Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

### Veteran Journey

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey where they might need to fill out a form:

-   Starting up
-   Taking care of myself
-   Reinventing myself
-   Putting down roots
-   Aging
-   Dying

Research Goals
--------------

The Forms Library Team aims to understand:

-   How Veterans use the Review Page in the forms experience by using the Application for Burial Benefits form Review Page as an example
-   Pain points and accessibility issues on the Review Page of the Application for Burial Benefits form experience
-   How Veterans interact with the Review Page components in order to determine which of the design variations best suit their needs and has the best usability 

### Outcome

The findings from this research will help the team better understand Veteran needs and expectations around the Review Page (after completion but before submission of a form). Based on use, Veteran expectation and task-success performance, a Review Page pattern that best suits Veteran needs will be chosen to build in the upcoming working demo of the new Forms Core system.

### Research questions

This research will help us understand:

-   How Veterans typically interact with the Review Page
-   Which of the two Review page design options work best for Veterans

### Hypotheses

-   Veterans find it easier to correct information on the review page when they can edit by section.
-   Time on task is improved by anchoring Veterans to the section they've just corrected.

Method
------

We will conduct remote moderated usability studies using a high-fidelity UXPin prototype. This round of research is focused on the mobile version of the designs.

### Location

Remote research using Zoom.
