key_findings:
  - "There are at least three eBenefits user-types: Power User (spends time browsing and learning about new opportunities, often serves as a Facilitator, refers to eBenefits often for documentation and self-service tools, has the site bookmarked, may have considerable VA benefits to manage); Occasional/Convenience User (has a specific goal or task in mind, referred to tools from someone else or through email, has specific URLs saved, primarily uses dashboard for actions, accesses eBenefits only occasionally); and Facilitator (familiar with eBenefits but guides others, may be professional VA/VSO employee or informal peer, shares knowledge verbally or via social media, has solid general knowledge of VA benefits and eBenefits)."
  - "eBenefits is a trusted educational/informational resource for Veterans. Veterans who visit eBenefits often use the 'learn' tab to discover helpful information (education & home loan benefits were top mentioned). Veterans are usually referred to specific tools or documents within eBenefits. Useful information on eBenefits is 'stumbled upon' as a result of browsing the site. Facilitator user-types will recommend eBenefits to Veterans."
  - "There is a need for benefit eligibility information to be more immediately available. Veterans often rely on word-of-mouth and accidental discovery to find benefits they are entitled to. Some participants cited a need to have a 'one-stop' list or accounting of benefits a Veteran is entitled to. The feeling is the VA has all the info needed to determine a Veteran's benefits."
  - "The current user paths around authorization and login are potential barriers to Veteran access to eBenefits. Users were uniformly dismayed by the login experience; most found it difficult or impossible to access their profiles. Some users considered logging-in a barrier to accessing eBenefits."
recommendations:
  - "Investigate ways to streamline authorization/login: Far and away, login is the most prevalent and frustrating pain point discussed in the interviews; it was nearly unanimous. Minimize linking back and forth between eBenefits and VA.gov. Migrate features in a way to reduce or eliminate linking across sites."
  - "Create a more cohesive transition plan in migrating eBenefits features to VA.gov: May include 'inbound' visitor messaging on VA.gov. Consideration given to alerting users when a link will cross domains."
  - "Better tier information to support users' tendencies: Surface general view-only information earlier in user paths. Consider the value of (truncated) high-level info as tiles in a dashboard arrangement. Preserve profile/dashboard screen layout to consolidate benefits info into single hub/view. Allow drill-down points to detailed info for power users. Create natural 'off-ramp' links to action items from informational views. Understand the value of eBenefits' educational component and preserve links to up-to-date, accurate information."
  - "Consider data sources during migration: Consolidate viewable and editable data around a single 'source of truth' that's consistent across VA.gov. Pre-fill forms and data by default. Offer opportunities to correct/add to/edit info where it is presented. Document multiple varying data sources; consider consolidation or syncing data across sources."

# eBenefits Discovery Findings
`Aricka Lewis & James Adams, October 2019`

The purpose of the discovery interview sessions for eBenefits was to understand generally how and why Veterans use the site. We asked questions regarding overall priorities and goals for using the site, specific features used, and general satisfaction.

## Methodology
- User Interviews, 30 - 50 minutes
- 10 veterans from varying backgrounds
  - All participants use eBenefits
  - Most or all participants have a disability rating
  - A majority of participants have dependents under their benefits
 - Participants were prompted using targeted questions from the conversation guide; but they were allowed to go "off script" when recounting their personal experiences. Veterans were encouraged to speak their mind.
#### Research Questions 
- How do users navigate to the eBenefits site?
- How do users interact with the current eBenefits site?
- What do users expect to do on eBenefits? on VA.gov?
- What differences do users find between the two sites?
- What other sites do Veterans use to access/manage benefits?
- What are user priorities on eBenefits?
- How do users interact with the following features?
  - Rated Disabilities
  - View Compensation Payment History
  - View Dependents
  - View Representative/POA
  - View Roles and Relationships
  - Login
- What are the different user roles for eBenefits?
## High Level Findings
1. There are at least three eBenefits user-types.
2. eBenefits is a trusted educational/informational resource for Veterans.
3. There is a need for benefit eligibility information to be more immediately available.
4. The current user paths around authorization and login are potential barriers to Veteran access to eBenefits.
### There are at least three eBenefits user-types
#### Power User
The Power User spends time in eBenefits browsing and learning about new opportunities. 
- They may also serve as a Facilitor, and help educate other veterans through: social media (Facebook), word of mouth, at work (if they are a VA employee) to their clients
- Power Users are refer to eBenefits often for documentation and self service tools like the claim status tracker (the tool is named Work in Process, but users referred to it as the Claim Status Progress or Tracker)
- They usually have the eBenefits site bookmarked or saved for easy access.
- As a Facilitator, they want the valuable information they find "accidentally" to be surfaced instead of navigating around the site to find it
- The Power User may have considerable VA benefits and has a need to review and manage benefits often.
#### Occasional/Convenience User
The Conveience User has a specific goal or task in mind when using the site.
- Convenience users are referred to tools or documents within eBenefits from someone else or through email
- They have specific URLs within eBenefits saved in a document or bookmarked in their browser
- They primarily use the dashboard to complete actions like adding dependents, changing personal information or checking claim status
- They will access eBenefits only occasionally; and the site may have changed in their absence.
#### Facilitator
The Facilitator is familiar with eBenefits as a user, but is in a position to refer and guide others. This position may be professional--such as a VA or VSO employee; or it may be informal--such as a friend or guide (as someone who's been there).
- Facilitators are different from Power Users in there personal use of eBenefits. 
  - Personally, Facilitators use eBenefits occasionally.
  - However, they may have a wide general understanding of the site.
- Facilitators will share knowlege verablly in informal settings.
- They may use social media to share knowledge.
- In a professional environment, Facilitators may walk-through or show screens, usually in person.
- Participants who were Facilitators seemed to have a solid general knowledge of VA benefits and the eBenefits site.
- Sometimes Facilitator participants were not completely current with the state of the eBenefits site.
### eBenefits is a trusted educational/informational resource for Veterans
- Veterans who visit eBenefits often use the "learn" tab in the header to discover helpful information:
  - Education & home loan benefits were the top mentioned benefits that Veterans learned about through eBenefits
- Veterans are usually referred to specific tools or documents within eBenefits 
- Useful information on eBenefits is "stumbled upon" as a result of browsing the site
- Facilitor user-types will recommend eBenefits to Veterans
### There is a need for benefit eligibility information to be more immediately available
- Veteran often rely on word-of-mouth and accidental discovery to find benefits they are entitled to.
- Some participants cited a need to have a 'one-stop' list or accounting of benefits a Veteran is entitled to.
- The feeling is the VA has all the info needed to determine a Veteran's benefits.
