# Research Plan for VSA eBenefits September 2019
## Goals
1. Product & Team: eBenefits migration, VSA eBenefits Team
2. Background: The eBenefits team is working to migrate all functionality to VA.gov in a way that is helpful for Veterans to receive faster access to benefits and care.
3. Research questions:
* How do users navigate to the eBenefits site?
  * Are they using a search engine, from VA.gov, etc.?
* How do users interact with the current eBenefits site?
* What do users expect to do on eBenefits? on VA.gov?
  * What differences do users find between the two sites?
* What other sites do Veterans use to access benefits? 
* What are user priorities on eBenefits?
* How do users interact with the following features?
  * Rated Disabilities
  * View Compensation Payment History
  * View Dependents
  * View Representative/POA
  * View Roles and Relationships
  * Login
* What are the different user roles for eBenefits?
4. Hypothesis: Veterans want to use VA.gov to solve all of their needs. They get frustrated when they are redirected to the eBenefits site from the main VA site. The assumption is that Veterans create "work arounds" on VA.gov so that they have limited contact with the eBenefits website.
## Method
Research method: Moderated remote user interviews 
Why this method: We are in the early, discovery stage of this project. We want to learn how and why users use eBenefits so that we can prioritize key features.
