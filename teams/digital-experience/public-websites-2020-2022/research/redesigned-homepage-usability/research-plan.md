# OUTDATED Research Plan: Moderated usability of the redesigned VA.gov home page
# [GO HERE INSTEAD](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-plan.md)

## Background
The current VA.gov website was launched in 2018 but hadn't been the subject of much user research until [Baseline Wayfinding Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding#baseline-wayfinding-research-on-vagov-april-2021) was conducted in June 2021. Findings from this research has been incorporated into the new design. 

[Research to discover the most important tasks to Veterans, caregivers, family members, survivors and service members](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks) is in progress. Top tasks identified during this research will influence additional design changes and determine the tasks to validate the design during these sessions.  

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 
- Veterans, caregivers, family members, survivors and service members are able to access tools and processes quickly and easily to learn about and manage their benefits
- Veterans, caregivers, family members, survivors and service members have increased access to self-service tools through an elevated login funnel

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to validate that the new design has improved the usability of the homepage. Rather than focusing participant attention on individual homepage components, we will observe which areas they use and how well the homepage supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries and those acting on behalf of Veterans in the process of completing important benefit-related tasks.

### Outcome
This research will inform iteratons to the redesign, the need for future research, and release decisions for the iteration.

### Research questions
The following questions will be answered in the context of task-based scenarios (which will be informed by findings from Top Task research conducted in May/June 2022):
- Are participants able to easily and quickly initiate tasks from the homepage?
- What part(s) of the homepage do participants use for the task?
- Does the homepage support participants, including those using assistive tech, in completing their tasks?
- Do the words/labels used on the homepage support participant understanding?
- What do Veterans (and others) expect from various areas of the homepage, including search functionality and VAntage Point blog promo?

### Areas of focus
We are primarily interested in the following areas of the homepage, in context with the header or footer, which may also provide a path for task completion
- Login/signup CTA
- Common task list
- Search
- Benefit hubs
- VAntage Point blog promo

### Hypotheses
 
- The prominent sign in/sign up location and CTA makes it easier for Veterans to easily sign in/sign up.
- More Veterans will use the prominent sign in/sign up CTA than the header. 
- The streamlined design helps Veterans find the task they need to complete more quickly.
- The new design includes the most common/important Veteran-facing tasks.
- The link labels are sufficient for Veterans to understand/recognize.
- Veterans will know to search for tasks which are not listed as most common/popular. 
- Veterans understand where "other search tools" links will take them and what information they will find there.
- A focused and prominently displayed VAntage Point blog promo increases Veteran engagement with the content.

## Method 

### Research materials

## Recruitment	

We would like Perigean to recruit [TBD] people to get at least [TBD].
Overall, we would like to get about 
- 2/3 Veterans and 1/3 Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, or service members
- At least 1/2 with experience using some VA benefits/services and 20% without such experience but interest in some

### Primary participant criteria:
- ALL have a computer or mobile device and are willing to use it to complete the activity
> putting cohorts from Top Task research here for reference_
> Veterans, Caregivers, Veteran family members, survivors, or service members
  > - at least [TBD] **WITH** experience with at least one of _education, career services, disability, housing, pension, life insurance, or burial benefits_ but **NO experience with _VA health care_** 
  > - experience with _disability benefits_
  > - experience with _education benefits or career services_
  > - experience with at least one of _housing, pension, life insurance, or burial benefits_
  > - **NO** experience with _any_ VA benefits or services but are interested in some 
  > - experience with at least one of _VA health care, education, career services, disability, housing, pension, life insurance, or burial benefits_. 

### Secondary participant criteria (nice to haves) across all cohorts:
- At least 6 women
- At least 15 people age 55 or older
- At least 5 people age 35 or under
- At least 10 people with a cognitive disability
- At least 10 people of color
- At least 5 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 5 people who live in a rural or remote area

### Coordination with Perigean
To assess potential participants' experiences with VA benefits or services, please use their answers to the Digital Service at VA User Research Participant Recruiting Screener Questionnaire question *Which VA benefits or services do you have any experience with?"*
