# Research Plan for Veteran Caller User Journey, September 2022


## Background
This study is being conducted by the VSP Contact Center team and for the purpose of establishing a verified user journey for VA.gov users who call to use Contact Center services. [This research will be used to inform this documented user journey map.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40967).

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following:

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov



### Veteran Journey
This research sits within these stages of the Veteran Journey:

  ·  Phase 1, Life Stage: Getting Out through Reinventing myself
  - GI Bill, Finding resources for higher education, working with SCOs 




## Research Goals	
We are trying to learn the following from this research:
 
· Understand the pain points of VA.gov users that use Tier 1 Call Center systems for resolving VA.gov issues. 

· Discover insights and task blockers for VA.gov users that have theirissues routed from Tier 1 to Tier 2 

· Discover insights regarding Tier 1 service teams using VA tools Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics and Ask VA (AVA) to interface with Veterans and/or their beneficaries. 



### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
  · This research will advance our user journey documentation for veterans callers using Tier 1 and 2 call centers. *Provide potential recommendations for improvements to the support user journey as it relates to resolving VA.gov issues and blockers.*

### Research questions 

Why do veterans use the call cente and what causes veterans frustrations when calling into a call center and? How does this affect service from Tier 2 and Tier 3 teams? 

1. For VA.gov users what are the most prominent pain points in their user journey from not finding their answer on Va.gov to calling the Tier 1 call centers? 
2. Are the currect expectations for VA.gov users to have their issues resolved or reviewed set correctly by the Tier 1 Call center agent? 

· When did you last encounter a problem on VA.gov, and what steps do you take to contact the VA call center about your issue?

· How long did you expect for your most recent issue or question to be resolved, when you made your first call about it? How many calls with the Call Center has taken place for this issue?

· Can you describe in a few sentences describe the issue? Were you in mobile or on a desktop? Can you recreate the issue that you had on VA.gov?

· Did you understand the timeframe in which you recieved an overall resolution to your issue?

· Which kind of communication do you rely on the most (phone, email, SMS, assistance with aide, or other)?

· As of this interview, what is the current status of your this issue being handled by the T1 Call Center (In-progress, Rerouted or Resolved?)

· What have been blockers/ difficulties in getting services through your VA call center?

· When recieving a resolution for your issue, did you feel you ended up with a satisfactory answer? Yes, No? Please explain

· Please describe your overall experience when communicating with a VA call center in the beginning of your issue?

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

· Our hypothesis is that Va.gov user that cannot complete an initial inquiry on VA.gov will often find their way to directly calling the Tier 1 Call center in hope of finding a specific resolution. We want to understand the decisions from why they are opting to call in first- than rather use VA tools such as askVA.gov. We also believe that expectations of timeframe of when their issues (cases) being resolved are not correctly communiticated- thus leading to more frustration.
