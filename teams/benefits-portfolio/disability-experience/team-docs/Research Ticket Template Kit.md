### :bookmark: Context
In 2025, we found that our research ticket templates did not accurately reflect the work conducted by the Disability Benefits Crew (DBC). We reviewed and updated the templates to better represent and encompass the full scope of DBC research activities.

The revised templates were reviewed by our HCD lead and our Research and Design VA Enablement lead, and then shared with all DBC designers and researchers for additional feedback.

All research tickets have now been standardized and templatized, and they are ready to be used (and reused) across our Kanban boards. 
  
### :mag: How to find the templates
All tickets have **`[DBC Research Ticket Template Kit - ##]`** at the start of their name. There are 21 templates in total, spanning the full course of a research initiative. 

To access and use the templates, simply create a new issue.

The master versions of these templates can be found in the [ISSUE_TEMPLATE folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) within va.gov's GitHub repo. \

### :pencil: How to use the templates
The templates themselves serve as suggestions and reminders, but not mandates. E.g. if you're using a different process than the one outlined, feel free to adapt the templates as needed. But they exist to make sure you don't forget specific steps, even if you have to adapt them to your use case.

 - When “Timeframe for this ticket” says “should fit within one sprint," this does not mean "take the whole sprint" but rather "this is doable within a sprint."
 - These tickets are set up for a particular type of testing (primarily qualitative interviews or usability tests). If you’re doing something different, some tasks may not apply.


### :brain: Good to know
As you start using these templates and have any questions or recommendations, please share your thoughts with a DBC designer and we'll discuss potential changes during one of our weekly syncs and communicate any changes made. Thank you!
