# Disability Benefits Crew
<mark>Last updated 2/25/2026</mark>

## Who we are
The Disability Benefits Crew (DBC) is composed of several teams: 
- Core Form: supports the core digitized Form 21-526EZ Application for Disability Benefits submission experience, ensuring submissions are timely, accurate, and captured in a way that allows VSRs and RVSRs easy review.
- Specialized Pathways: focuses on [ancillary forms](https://www.va.gov/supporting-forms-for-claims/) and pathways, such as the 0781 form (an embedded form for providing additional information about mental health and traumatic events) or the 4142 form (an embedded form to give VA permission to collect private medical records).
- Conditions and Evidence: supports the conditions and evidence steps (section 2) of the 21-526EZ, where users add and manage their conditions.
- Employee Experience: focuses on looking for ways to make VA.gov claims more actionable by making sure they are complete, relevant, and reduce burdensome manual actions that need to be taken by claims processors (VSRs and RVSRs).
- Team Hi5: currently supporting efforts to improve the user experience for users of the 21-526EZ.


## Team charter
The disability crew maintains and improves the application for disability compensation on VA.gov (Form 21-526EZ). Through this benefit, Veterans can receive monthly pay for injuries and illnesses that are a result of their service. We also are responsible for features nested within the disability form, including:
- Auto-setting an Intent to File, locking in a potential backpay date
- A slightly different version of the form for applicants transitioning out of the military who are eligible for the Benefits Disability at Discharge program (BDD)
- Suggesting a set of conditions Veterans can claim, and then applying a topical classification to each condition (this team organizes primarily in [#benefits-disability-conditions channel](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04AZ8T7XN1))
- Uploading files/evidence provided by the Veteran along with the application form
