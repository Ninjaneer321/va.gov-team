**Logging Silent Failures**

**VA Form 21P-0537 - Marital Status Questionnaire for DIC Recipients**

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Team:** Benefits Intake Optimization (BIOHEART)

**Summary**

Silent failures are errors that occur in the background without user-facing error messages. These errors can be difficult to detect and troubleshoot, as they may not generate visible symptoms or alerts.

VA Form 21P-0537 is a synchronous submission form with no background jobs or asynchronous processes. All form operations (prefill, validation, submission) occur in real-time with immediate user feedback. Therefore, we expect no silent failures.

**Monitoring**

| Component | Monitoring Approach | Alert Threshold |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Form Submissions | Datadog submission tracking | Submission failure rate >5% |
| API Errors | Sentry error tracking | Any 500-level errors |
| Save-in-Progress | Application logs | Save failure rate >3% |
| Prefill Service | Datadog service health | Service availability <99% |

**Expected Silent Failures**

None. All errors surface to the user or are captured in monitoring systems.

In the event of outages or degraded service, our monitoring alerts the team for immediate response.
