#### Creating Your Team README

- To create a copy of this template, click "Edit" then copy all of the content within the file. Within your team folder, which is located in a folder for your team's portfolio, create a new file called "README.md" and paste this content.
- Update and complete as applicable to your team. Replace all bracketed placeholders with your actual team information.
- This template is designed to be parsed by an automated system, named Manifest, to display team rosters, product owner classifications, and organizational affiliations. Thus please don't make changes to the format in the Team Information section. Do your best to fill out all parts of that section (rather than putting n/a ask for help as every team should have this information)
- Copy the [Product details template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/product-details-template.yml) from the public va.gov-team repository into each product directory of the products your team works on. Name the file "[product-name]-details.yml". Then complete that file to the best of your ability for your product. Not all fields are required.
    - Then link to each of your products in your team README.md file in the "Products we own" section using the full GitHub URL to the public repository.
- Delete the reference to these instructions when you are done.
