# How We Work
Updated 7/10/2025

## Assume positive intent
We are all here because we want to improve the lives of Veterans.  To that end, our default assumption is that everyone involved with this work has done their best to build a positive experience with what was available to them at the time.  The decisions that got us here were made by smart and capable people, and were likely influenced by forces beyond their control like policy, legal, patient safety, technical, budgetary, or other constraints.

## Communications expectations
These expectations will help you determine the best way to contact various team members and stakeholders and save you from waste time attempting to reach people via channels they may not frequent.
### Slack
- Slack is the default communication channel for My HealtheVet teams and most teams creating applications on VA.gov and VA Health and Benefits mobile apps.
- Information on getting access to Slack is included later in our orientation checklist.
- Use public channels by default.
- Before posting in a channel you're new to, view the channel  topic and description.  Some channels ask that threads be started with a command to initiate a workflow.
- Thread conversations to reduce noise in channels ðŸ§µ
- Start new threads with a short intro, then reply to it to add additional details and collaborate.
- If an ongoing thread needs to be moved to a different channel, include a link back to the original conversation, and add a link from the original to the new, noting that the conversation has been moved.

## Agile Scrum

## Meetings
        * Host meetings on Teams (Zoom is no longer supported by VA and many VA staff can't access it)
        * Log in from VA.gov network so everyone has access to recordings and transcripts
        * Host should send invite from VA.gov calendar
            * Include purpose, agenda, goal
            * Send pertinent documents out ahead of time 
        * List of our standing meetings (times to avoid)
            * Health Portfolio
            * OCTO All-Hands
            * Thought: Maybe we should try to coordinate our calendars before onboarding new teams so team meetings are roughly the same day/time and have more availability for unplanned meetings?
        * Check key attendees' calendars for availability (using VA.gov calendar will simplify)
            * Ask before scheduling over blocked or tentative times 
            * If a key attendee canâ€™t attend, reschedule 
            * Suggestions for hard to schedule time sensitive meetings (Outlook tool, When2Meet)
        * Start 5 minutes after the hour
        * Save meeting notes (where?)
        * Send out notes, action items, documents after
        * Meeting are considerate for time zone

## Documentation
- Store documents in GitHub, SharePoint, but not on Google Drive, DropBox, etc.
- Anything containing credentials should be stored in the GitHub sensitive repo
