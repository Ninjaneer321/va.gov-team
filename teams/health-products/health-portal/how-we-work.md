Team communications
- Slack for communication with 
    * Use VA Teams to participate in communication with some VHA stakeholders and store files to share with our business partners 
    * Use VA.gov email
        * Encrypt anythingthat includes PII or PHI
    * We use Slack as primary form of communication
        * No PII or PHI
        * Transparency is key -- use public channels as much as possible
        * Links to our team/pod channels
        * Links to platform and support channels 
        * Links to other important channels 
        * Features
            * Canvases
            * Lists
        * Threading conversations 
        * Tips
            * Pinning canvases, lists, docs
            * Creating self reminders
            * Creating team reminders
            * Saving posts for later
            * using Reactions to provide more engagement
Meetings
        * Host meetings on Teams (Zoom is no longer supported by VA and many VA staff can't access it)
        * Log in from VA.gov network so everyone has access to recordings and transcripts
        * Host should send invite from VA.gov calendar
            * Include purpose, agenda, goal
            * Send pertinent documents out ahead of time 
        * List of our standing meetings (times to avoid)
            * Health Portfolio
            * OCTO All-Hands
            * Thought: Maybe we should try to coordinate our calendars before onboarding new teams so team meetings are roughly the same day/time and have more availability for unplanned meetings?
        * Check key attendees' calendars for availability (using VA.gov calendar will simplify)
            * Ask before scheduling over blocked or tentative times 
            * If a key attendee canâ€™t attend, reschedule 
            * Suggestions for hard to schedule time sensitive meetings (Outlook tool, When2Meet)
        * Start 5 minutes after the hour
        * Save meeting notes (where?)
        * Send out notes, action items, documents after
        * Meeting are considerate for time zone
