# VA.gov accessibility specialist onboarding guide (WIP)
Jamie Klenetsky Fay `last updated May 22, 2024`

## Is this guide for me?
You're at the right place if you work on VA.gov (as an employee of VA or a contracting agency/consultancy), and:
- You are an accessibility specialist, OR
- You spend at least 50% of your time on accessibility-related work

We'll call both groups "accessibility specialists" collectively throughout this document.

If you don't fit this description, this isn't the guide for you. Instead, visit [Accessibility on VA.gov](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/accessibility-on-va-gov).

## Welcome to VA.gov!
We're thrilled to welcome you to VA.gov. VA cares deeply about accessibility, and the work you do here will help Veterans nationwide.

### Onboarding (this needs a new title)
something about...you'll get an onboarding ticket, you'll have to get set up in GH, Slack, might get GFE, it's a whole darn thing

### Just breathe.
As you start your journey at VA, you may feel overwhelmed. _This is normal._ Accessibility is vital, but often difficult, work.

Remember, it's ok to...

- say "I don't know"
- ask for more clarity
- stay at home when you feel ill
- say you don't understand
- ask what acronyms stand for
- ask why, and why not
- forget things
- introduce yourself
- depend on the team
- ask for help
- not know everything
- have quiet days
- have loud days, to talk, joke and laugh
- put your headphones on
- say "No" when you're too busy
- make mistakes
- sing
- sigh
- not check your email out of hours
- not check your email constantly during hours
- just Slack it
- walk over and ask someone face-to-face
- go somewhere else to concentrate
- offer feedback on other people's work
- challenge things you're not comfortable with
- say yes when anyone does a coffee run
- prefer tea
- snack
- have a messy desk
- have a tidy desk
- work how you like to work
- ask the management to fix it
- have off-days
- have days off

## Your role
At VA.gov, accessibility responsibilities are split between product and support teams. Your role will differ depending on what team you're on.

### Embedded on a product team
If you're embedded on a product team (a "Veteran-facing service," or "VFS," team), your job is to ensure that your product(s) are as accessible as possible. You should aim to bake accessibility into the design and development process from the beginning ("shift left").

Some embedded team members accessibility specialists, focusing purely on accessibility work. Others are accessibility-minded researchers, designers, developers, or product managers. 
 In all cases, you have a pivotal role to play in the accessibility of your team's work.

### Support: the CAIA team
The Content, Accessibility, and Information Architecture team ("CAIA") is a sitewide support team. If you're on CAIA, your role is to support product teams as they build their products. To do this, you will:
- Review products in the design phase for accessibility concerns
- Conduct accessibility audits of products on staging and in production
- Run assistive technology research pilots
- Assist teams with assistive technology research sessions with participants with disabilities

### Support: the Governance team

### Slack channels
These channels are a must-join for accessibility specialist at VA.gov:

These channels aren't required, but we recommend you join them. They'll give you visibility into different disciplines at VA.gov, along with the platform itself:
- [#platform-design-system](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C01DBGX4P45) (VA.gov's design system is at [design.va.gov](https://design.va.gov/)) 
- [#slack_information](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CU058Q9FH)
- [#vfs-all-teams](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CE4304QPK) (all the teams who create Veteran-facing products)

- [#research-ops](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C0216PL32HJ) (design researchers and folks who support them)
- [#trauma-practice](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04F9JLSATE) (informal group of folks interested in trauma informed/responsive design, meetings are available)

And if you're embedded on a product team, you might want to follow channels from other teams in your Crew. For example, if you're on a Benefits team, you might want to follow other Benefits teams' channels! This will give you insight into what those teams are up to, and open up more possibilities for cross-team collaboration.
