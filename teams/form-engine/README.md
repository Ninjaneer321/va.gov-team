# VA Digital Form Builder

The current process of filling out, submitting, and maintaining forms is cumbersome for both veterans and VA staff, often causing delays, errors, and frustration. Additionally, staff managing paper forms typically lack the expertise and resources to convert PDF forms into online formats or update digital versions, leaving them reliant on developers. It became clear that a digital solution was essential to help both VA staff and veterans overcome these challenges, which is exactly why the Digital Form Builder was designed to do. 

Designed exclusively for non-technical users, the VA Digital Form Builder aims to transform the way forms are created and maintained, providing a seamless, efficient, and user-friendly solution for both Veterans and VA staff, aligning with the overall vision of reducing burdens and enhancing digital experiences.

We see the Digital Form Builder as a catalyst for change, streamlining form creation, automating tasks, and eliminating redundancies—all while reducing errors and avoiding the need for costly custom development.  This paves the way for a more responsive and agile VA system, enabling VA staff to work smarter, not harder. 

## Aligned with 21st Century IDEA requirements 

- **Supports VA Digitization Modernation** – By leveraging existing VA data and ensuring accessibility compliance, the Form Builder aligns with VA’s goal of improving efficiency and user experience across services.
   -  By leveraging the VA Forms Library, the solution maintains accessibility and compliance standards while reducing redundant development efforts.

- **Increase Processing Efficiency and Reduce Manual Work** – **Automate** repetitive tasks to decrease administrative burden on VA Staff. VA staff will no longer need to repeatedly enter the same information. This tool will pre-fill known data, reducing errors and saving time.
  
- **Empowers VA Staff** – Non-technical users can create, update, and manage forms without relying on developers, allowing faster response times to veterans’ needs. Reduces reliance on IT teams, allowing faster form updates and service immprovements.

- **Accelerates Form Processing** – Digital-first workflows and automation will reduce manual tasks, enabling quicker submission and processing of benefits applications.
   - Developing a matching PDF for Form 21-4140 revealed significant infrastructure limitations, particularly the reliance on manual processes in the current form submission workflow. We provided the VA with key insights to guide future modernization efforts, emphasizing the need to automate the submission process.

## Success Metrics

- **Faster Form Completion** - Reduction in time spent filling out forms.

- **Fewer Errors and Redunacies** - Pre-filled data ensures accuracy.

- **Higher Staff Adoption** - VA staff independently using the tool.
  
- **Faster Processing Times** - Reduction in time from submission to benefit processing.
 
## Milestones Completed from June 2024 - March 2025
