Welcome
This is an overview and Runbook for Form Builder. 

The process outlined here is specific to the UI that has been created in Drupal to support the quick conversion of existing PDF-based forms into an online, interactive experience for Veterans. There are additional systems and processes in place that support this tool. Explaining all of the related dependencies are beyond the immediate scope of this documentation, but will referenced when needed. 

The UI leverages visual elements of the VA Design System in support of creating a consistent experience for both internal and Veteran-facing tools. We will go into more detail as we talk about how to use Form Builder. 

Keep in mind, this documentation is “living.” and will reflect updates to the tools and processes used by OCTO and the VA Design System.
