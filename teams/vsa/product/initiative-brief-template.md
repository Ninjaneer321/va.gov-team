# Initiative Brief Template
#### Overview

<details>
 
Veterans often encounter barriers when attempting to correct personal information (e.g., name, gender, service dates) due to fragmented data ownership between the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense (DoD). This repository outlines the work to improve the Veteran and staff experience by clarifying data ownership, documenting update workflows, and providing standardized communication and escalation tools.
