## Analysis
[Resources and support ratings spreadsheet]
- This month R&S didn't meet our goal of 75% or higher "good" ratings, with a XX% "good" average rating. This can be attributed to large numbers of "bad" ratings for sign-in related pages. This will most likely continue during the sign-in transition process but we will continue to monitor it.
- Performance isn't as high when broken down to individual pages:
  - XX% of pages are scoring at 90% or higher "good"
  - XX% of pages are meeting our goal of 75% or higher "good," while XX% of pages are scoring 70% or higher
  - XX% of pages are scoring at less than 50% "good," with X% scoring at less than 10% "good" 
- Sign-in related content continues to have the highest volume of total responses with "bad" ratings. The total number of responses have gone up for these pages since we launched the sign-in transition campaign.
- The PACT Act page continues to be the page with the most responses and has a very high number of "good" responses.
