# Honeydew
## Purpose
Let's make a list of pages/components/functionality that could use some extra love. We can note down changes that we want to make without flooding the board with small tickets, so we can combine like work, and slowly improve on all of our apps as we grow! Stuff here can be as generic or specific as you want, and it won't necessarily mean we will implement the change, but we can at least discuss the best practices and reasonable approaches.  

## Other
- [ ]  DOCUMENTATIONNNNNNNNNNNNNN - add more! -- make time to add more

## FSR Changes
- [ ] Employment history - veteran and spouse currently have separate components, but we can likely combine

## CDP Changes
- [ ] styling updates - there's some room for improvement where we can likely just combine the three scss files in the CDP so it's easier to find.
