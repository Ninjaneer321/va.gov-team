### Notes
- 0781 Design [screenshare Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1715641897177/87fab1b22d2833fc50d79c68313efc63115c8cd0?sender=u3672f0ffd2d02de8b0885285)
  - Question 10B - additional info about behavior change
    - What is this asking for exactly? Describe the behavior change or records that may exist?
      - All of the above. Could mention other medical records that need to be obtained, details about when the change in behavior happened
      - Keep this section general in the form so that Veterans can provide more context for whichever option they select
  - Question 11 - police report location
    - what does this mean? city? Precinct?
      - More detail is better in case they need to try to get the police report. State is not helpful, township is much more helpful. City + state is a minimum, handling agency would be best — county sheriff, city cop, police department etc.
      - Would be better if the label said something like “provide the agency involved”
  - Question 13A - treatment details
    - “I think mental health might be incorrect here - I think you could possibly be treated for a physical attack or combat injury that then also had mental health implications. “
      - Align with paper form - any treatment related to event, not just related to mental health condition resulting from the event
    - Could we reference the condition they claimed instead of the traumatic event?
      - We’re working with CC team to think through how they enter the flow
      - “Traumatic event” language could be confusing since it’s embedded in the 526. Linking to their condition might be more clear.
      - Need to make it clear why they’re being asked these questions - indicated a claim for a mental health condition. Consistency in language is the important thing.
      - Treatment of the physical condition resulting from an event would validate that the event took place, even if it wasn’t treatment for the mental health condition. So it's still useful to include that here.
  - Question 12 - supporting documents
    - One screen per box checked? Yes based on current design
    - If they don’t have it available, they can continue without uploading
    - What about combining uploads on one page?
      - No distinct labels for evidence types in VBMS, but wouldn’t hurt
      - Look at document type dropdown that’s in the current 526 for other evidence types
      - What if they check three things and only upload two documents? Would want all checkboxes to be visible in case they’re planning to upload some later
    - Open question: if this is in section 2, when they get to section 3 there will be another opportunity to upload supporting documents. Thinking through how to message that so the Veteran doesn’t upload things twice
