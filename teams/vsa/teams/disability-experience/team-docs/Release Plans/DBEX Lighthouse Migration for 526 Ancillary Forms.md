## Success criteria


### Current stats


## Resource materials


## New capabilities and changes


## Production release plan
For the BDD release, we want to start by setting the feature flipper to send 1% of BDD uploads to Lighthouse. 
After successfully passing the testing plan, we will then increase usage to 5%, 50%, then 100%.
0781 and the Veteran-uploaded documents will follow a similar pattern, based on how the initial BDD test goes.

Length of time: 

Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 1% of users, ~xxx submissions


## Risks

## Production issues recovery plan
DBEX team Carbs and OCTO PO will monitor analytics. If something goes wrong, the engineering teams will be on standby to disable the flippers which would prevent any user starting a new form from entering the path for the new 0781 redirect flow and instead direct them through the original flow for entering or uploading their 0781 and 0781a form/data.
