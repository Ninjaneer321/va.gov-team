# How We Work



| Problem                                                      | Experiment                                                   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| too many big-ticket initiatives                              | break them down to be smaller                                |
|                                                              | more alignment of definition of Veteran value                |
|                                                              | improved understanding problem definition as some may be related to similar Veteran impact             |
|                                                              | deliver work fastter by delivering smaller              |
| too much context switching                                   | Limit WIP                                                    |
| risk of burnout                                              | improved definition of done                                  |
| lots of turnover                                             | ?                                                            |
| Tight timelines and speed pressure                           | more advance notice when possible, limit WIP so we can get work done more efficiently |
| Handle new time-sensitive priorities and requests            | create a lane for urgent unplanned work to come through      |
| Initiatives take too long                                    | limit WIP, better DoD, better DoD                            |
|                                                              | increase depth of knowledge by relegating initatives to one team |
|                                                              | consider araeas of specialization when planning work         |
| Not clear when initiatives are done                          | better understanding of business problem, ideate way         |
| Too much putting work down & picking up later                | better definition of value, lane for urgent unplanned work   |
| Hard to feel that team members have made an observable contribution | improve UX & Product metrics, beter DoD, celebrate success   |
| More space for collaboration and co-working on problems      | create a leads touchpoint each month for planning            |
|                                                              | create a cadence of cross-functional ideation across UX, Product, Design |
| engineering to be involved earlier in the process            | regularly hold ideation sessions that are effectively-facilitated within the team |
| Shorten time to value                                        | deliver work in smaller increments                           |
|                                                              | have alignment on Veteran Value                              |
|                                                              | better understanding of business problems to solve           |
|                                                              | dial in team PDLC processes so we                            |
| increase collaboration across team roles (Eng, Product, Design) | better understanding of who does what, where DACI is for each role |
| teams don’t always feel responsible for how to prioritize work | more advance notice when possible                            |
|                                                              | better understanding of Veteran value or impact              |
|                                                              |                                                              |
| teams don’t always feel responsible for delivery timing      | more awareness of constraints that impact specific work      |
| Strategy of how to plan work isn’t always clear              | hold monthly planning meetings across teams where we discuss upcoming work and handle open questions we need to drive improved DoD, impact, value, risks, constraints |
| More alignment of what it means to be “done” for work features | better understaning of business problem                      |
|                                                              |  better understanding of success criteira                    |
| tech debt that doesn’t get resolved                          | create a lane for tech debt each sprint                      |
|                                                              |                                                              |



Constraints:
**way more engineering work than design work that is under important time pressure**: the EVSS-> LH migration and CY work is large, complex, and unfolding in real-time in ways we cannot control because we are dependent and collaborating with other teams. This has separated design and engineering pretty heavily because there simply isn't design work on these projects, yet engineering is fully indexed.
new priorities and requests will come to us pretty often, and we sometimes have to pivot to take them up, especially if they have a higher Veteran impact than what's currently on the plate. Or tied to something like a congressional mandate. This can cause churn and context switching, but it's unavoidable at times.
competing desires between VBA business partners, OCTO gov leads, Veteran feedback, and product team interest
OCTO plans  priorities generally a quarter ahead -- work further than that may be broadly accurate, but will likely be changed and tweaked and shouldn't be considered in stone.

Current state:
Prioritization sheet needs updating now that we're in July, and the descriptions need refinement. What's done? what's left? Any expected timelines should also be consistently noted. The description  of the initiative should help shape a clearer definition of done.
too many competing initiatives at a single time and may continue the problems noted above

Next Steps:
* Use next session to get into specific problem solving
* Can we set WIP limits
* Identify the action items that will best optimize roadmap
* Identify the experiment we’re goign to try next quarter
* Lisa & Jared to name the right structure of the conversation for next time


**Emily:**
prioritization, roadmapping, and work planning.
~~too many big-ticket initiatives,~~ 
~~there's a lot of cost and risk of burnout when context switching between them.~~ 
~~Some of those requests have tight timelines and speed pressure,~~
~~new, random things can come in too.~~
~~when initiatives go on too long~~ 
~~Initatives aren't clear when they're done~~
~~Initiatives have to get picked up and put down many times.~~
~~It's great to feel that you've made an observable contribution~~
~~desire for more space for collaboration and coworking on problems, which can be lost when there is pressure to churn out across a couple of different initiatives.~~ 
~~We noted a specific desire for engineering to be involved earlier in the process~~

**Notes fom Product Sync**
~~How might we move towards smaller feature delivery? - shorten time to value~~
~~increase collaboration across team roles (Eng, Product, Design)~~
~~empower teams to be more responsible for how to prioritize work and delivery timing~~
~~improve work planning~~
~~limit context switching~~
~~more alignment of the definition of done for certain work or features~~
~~How can we balance Veteran and business need while controlling context switching and teams timelines?~~
