# How We Work

### Proposal:
* Create a cadence of reviewing new and existing high level initiatives with OCTO on a quarterly basis
* Create a monthly **strategic planning meeting** with leads from each team and OCTO (OCTO PO and Design Lead, DM, PM, Team Design Leads, Team Engineering Leads to:
  * Better define initatives and epics for upcoming sprints. We’ll;
    * Engage roles across both teams and OCTO to drive clarity on problem statements, success criteria, definition of veteran impact, defintion of business impact. Effectively working ahead of the team with improved understanding.
    * Assign work based with consideration given to 1) current workload and priority work 2) each team’s current area of skillsets or competencies
    * Define and leverage shared language of Veteran impact as a mechanism to aid with prioritization
    * Understand how constraints impact delivery timing
  * Understand how we’ll collaborate across teams to solve the Veteran problems
    * Understand how members of either team need to be involved in work that another team is working on
  * Deliver faster with higher quality
    * Use WIP limits to limit the number of Features (Epics) a team is working on at a given time (proposal: 2)
    * Maintain an open “lane” for 1) tech debt, and 2) urgent unplanned work (Proposal ~10-20%)
    * Break down Initiatives into small increments that can be delivered quickly. Aim for < 6 weeks
* Create mechanisms for cross-team collaboration
  * Build clear and consistent practice for brainstorming/ideating across roles and teams
* Improve and leverage UX, Product, and Engineering metrics to measure against defined success criteria

### Risks & Challenges
* When distributing work across multituple teams,  teams may need time to re-familliarize themselves with the problem space and codebase
  * Strategic planning meetings can be used to surface and socialize features of form 526, sharing knowledge across Product, UX, Design, Delivery, and Engineering
  * Appropriate documentation can be created to share knowledge
  * Sprint Reviews can be further augmented to index on knowledge sharing
* Current areas of product specialization could pigenhole teams into doing the same work, and thus not spreading knowledge
  * We’ll need to balance time to value with the cost of spreading knowledge
* We may not currently have a shared language of Veteran impact.
  * If not, this will need to be created with alignment across all teams involved
* Unplanned and urgent or time-sensitive requests may still come up mid-sprint.
  * We’ll try to get ahead of this with monthly strategic planning meeting
  * The effort required to ship these items may exeec the dedicated “lane” for tech debt we’’ve allocated
* Create a cadence of reviewing new and existing high level initiatives with OCTO on a quarterly basis - becomes irrelevant due to monthly mtg

### Open questions:
* does OCTO have a quarterly planning?
  * if so, theirs should be ahead of ours

Constraints:
**way more engineering work than design work that is under important time pressure**: the EVSS-> LH migration and CY work is large, complex, and unfolding in real-time in ways we cannot control because we are dependent and collaborating with other teams. This has separated design and engineering pretty heavily because there simply isn't design work on these projects, yet engineering is fully indexed.
new priorities and requests will come to us pretty often, and we sometimes have to pivot to take them up, especially if they have a higher Veteran impact than what's currently on the plate. Or tied to something like a congressional mandate. This can cause churn and context switching, but it's unavoidable at times.
competing desires between VBA business partners, OCTO gov leads, Veteran feedback, and product team interest
OCTO plans  priorities generally a quarter ahead -- work further than that may be broadly accurate, but will likely be changed and tweaked and shouldn't be considered in stone.

Current state:
Prioritization sheet needs updating now that we're in July, and the descriptions need refinement. What's done? what's left? Any expected timelines should also be consistently noted. The description  of the initiative should help shape a clearer definition of done.
too many competing initiatives at a single time and may continue the problems noted above

Next Steps:
* Use next session to get into specific problem solving
* Can we set WIP limits
* Identify the action items that will best optimize roadmap
* Identify the experiment we’re goign to try next quarter
* Lisa & Jared to name the right structure of the conversation for next time


**Emily:**
prioritization, roadmapping, and work planning.
~~too many big-ticket initiatives,~~ 
~~there's a lot of cost and risk of burnout when context switching between them.~~ 
~~Some of those requests have tight timelines and speed pressure,~~
~~new, random things can come in too.~~
~~when initiatives go on too long~~ 
~~Initatives aren't clear when they're done~~
~~Initiatives have to get picked up and put down many times.~~
~~It's great to feel that you've made an observable contribution~~
~~desire for more space for collaboration and coworking on problems, which can be lost when there is pressure to churn out across a couple of different initiatives.~~ 
~~We noted a specific desire for engineering to be involved earlier in the process~~

**Notes fom Product Sync**
~~How might we move towards smaller feature delivery? - shorten time to value~~
~~increase collaboration across team roles (Eng, Product, Design)~~
~~empower teams to be more responsible for how to prioritize work and delivery timing~~
~~improve work planning~~
~~limit context switching~~
~~more alignment of the definition of done for certain work or features~~
~~How can we balance Veteran and business need while controlling context switching and teams timelines?~~


Goals for changes

The goals we are trying to achieve by having these discussions: 
- Better way of working across both teams with OCTO
- Empowering the teams do decide for themselves how they work 
- Increase team satisfaction on the work they are doing
- Share responsibilities and create a platform that both teams have full knowledge of (vs. pieces) (IOW - shared knowledge vs. speciality knowledge) 
- Deliver quality vs. quantity
