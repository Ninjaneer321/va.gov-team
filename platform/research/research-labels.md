# Research Repository Labels
These labels are used to organize our research located on the [research repository board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880)

They may also be used for front-loading yaml meta-data in markdown files to make it easier for Github Copilot to answer queries about research.
