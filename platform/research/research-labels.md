# Research Repository Labels
These labels are used to organize our research located on the [research repository board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880)

They may also be used for yaml frontmatter meta-data in markdown files to make it easier for Github Copilot to answer queries about research.

# Github Research Repository Labels 
This table lists all research repository labels, reorganized by **Category** (alphabetically), and within each category, sorted by **Name** alphabetically. The **Category** column appears first.
