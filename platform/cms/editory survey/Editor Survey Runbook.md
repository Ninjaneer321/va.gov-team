## Editor Survey and Communications Runbook

The CMS team uses Optimal workshop to send out the editor survey and Optimal workshop is owned by the platform team (contact Platform Design Lead `@Naomi Marcussen` on Slack). All CMS studies, including Editor Survey reports, are saved in this [folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/research). 

After the first survey was sent out (on 8/27/2024), we will have more flexibility in the format and types of questions, if the CMS team wants to make edits to the survey. All edits should be approved by the CMS VA Product Owner. 

When the survey is ready to be planned out and sent out, please refer to this [ticket template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/18469) to pull the work into the sprint.

Schedule - When should the survey be sent out
The editor survey will be sent out on a biannual basis and should inform the priorities for the upcoming quarters. The survey will should be open to editors for about a week (plus or minus a few days, depending on the volume of submissions, holidays, and competing priorities for editors). Here’s the schedule for each survey:

First survey, Q1-Q2: January – June
