** Q3 2024 ** Editor Survey Results

Response Rate - All Products, All Users
---------------------------------------
| All Editors  | Target | Actual 24Q3 |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| Participants | 221    | 80          |
| Total        | 1107   | 1107        |
| Response     | 20%    | 7%          |


Our initial survey's total response rate fell below our target of 20%. We will use this as our baseline. It is crucial that we brainstorm ideas to effectively communicate the value of submitting a complete survey about their experience to the editors.

Response Rate by Product/User Section
-------------------------------------

[table]

The largest group to respond was the VAMC editors, while the largest group contacted is the Vet Center editors. We saw a strong response from the VBA Regional editors followed by Resources and Support editors.

How can we improve the response rate for the VAMC and Vet Center editors?

#### **Question:**  
What, if anything, could improve your satisfaction with the Drupal CMS?

[table]

**💬 Notable Quotes:**

> _More flexibility in photo sizes for stories; quick publishing time._

> _There needs to be the ability to add more photos to feature stories. It would also be nice to embed videos. People rely on visual content in stories in todays world and having one photo is not adequate…_

A significant number of editors are expressing a desire for enhanced capabilities in content creation. Specifically, they are requesting additional features related to the process of selecting photos, including the ability to add more images than currently allowed. Another key area highlighted by the majority of feedback is the need to improve publishing speed. We acknowledge their challenges and are actively working to enhance the publishing workflow.

Editors are demonstrating a divergence in their understanding of the purpose of the Drupal-CMS system, with many comments requesting more customization and flexibility within templates. We believe that editors may not fully comprehend the intentional consistency of all Drupal-CMS products for all site visitors. Providing transparency into this intentionality is crucial.

[table]

**💬 Notable Quotes:**

> _It does its job. But one thing I would like to change, is that its updating time changes to a later time instead of the middle of the day when I'm working (I'm on Eastern Time). But if that couldn't happen, it's fine, I can manage._

> _I think it goes a good job of standardizing content across VA for Veterans who use multiple facilities._

Overall, editors express satisfaction with the Drupal-CMS meeting their expectations. However, they have provided valuable suggestions for improvement, including but not limited to the following areas: publish speed, photo use limitations, and adjustments to the content update timeframe.

#### **Question:**  
Do you have any thoughts or comments regarding your experience with the help desk?

**Affinity Mapping Results:**

[table]

**💬 Notable Quotes:**

> _They are fast. Always able to resolve the issue, and is timely about informing the user group when something is going pear shaped. No issues with the help desk. 10/10, would ask for help again._

> _Most of the things I have required assistance from the helpdesk for were in the knowledge base but were not named in such a way to intuit their purpose or did not use industry-standard keywords or even VA-specific ones that related to the solution/problem and did not display in the search results._

> _My experience with the help desk has always been great: they are patient, kind and very helpful indeed._

Editors are understanding of the Help Desk's scope of support and are empathetic towards their limitations. They acknowledge that the Help Desk provides timely responses and is perceived as helpful, efficient, and supportive. However, they suggest that there is room for improvement in the communication methods, particularly with regard to potentially disconnected email threads causing a lack of continuity.

####   
**Question:**  
Do you have any thoughts or comments regarding your experience with the CMS Knowledge Base?

**Affinity Mapping Results:**

[table]

**💬 Notable Quotes:**

> _I can never find what I'm looking for, so I end up having to contact the help desk._

> _Names of articles and jargon/key terms used within limit search result effectiveness. Many FAQ and related issue links create loops within the KB articles._

> _Oftentimes I find KB articles with outdated information or I can't find an article on what I'm looking for. Sometimes I can find something that's similar but it doesn't pertain to my sections so it's not really relevant. KB articles often seem more geared to VAMC editors than for those working in benefits or R&S._

> _Very helpful resource._

The feedback on the Knowledge Base is mixed, with some editors finding it helpful while others feel it does not live up to its advertised usefulness. Many editors struggle with the technical language used in the articles, making it difficult for them to understand the content. Additionally, editors express frustration with the navigation process when searching for articles, and they are looking for a more user-friendly approach to finding the information they need. Along with language and tone, editors are dissatisfied with the content, perceiving it to be outdated and unhelpful. Previous research suggests that editors prefer asking a colleague for help rather than using the Knowledge Base.

**💬 Notable Quotes:**

> _Make content publish faster. We were told a year ago there would be rolling content releases and that has not happened. It still takes 1-1/2 to 2 hours for something to publish. Try explaining that to your facility leadership over and over again. Also, the Drupal system is down frequently for whatever reasons. And, move the daily maintenance to sometime after normal working hours!_

> _Just a reminder to keep it a simple as possible. We can't afford to spend too much time on the website._

> _Replace it with something user friendly._

> _This web template is weak on what visual content, and amount of visual content, that can be published._

They have also expressed a desire for simplified workflows and processes that do not necessitate additional training or learning to operate effectively.
