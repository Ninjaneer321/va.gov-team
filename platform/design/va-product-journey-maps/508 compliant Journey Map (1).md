JOURNEYS OF
VETERANS MAP

This map covers ten life stages any Veteran may encounter, from
pre-service to end of life. These life stages are organized in three
phases in which Veterans’ goals and aspirations are distinctly different.
Each life stage lists out moments Veterans typically experience and
associated VA services, and calls out key “moments that matter”
which may have significant impact on Veterans’ experiences.

balancing life inside

the first interaction
with VA.

MOMENT THAT MATTERS
Finding something to
do like returning to
school, going to work,
or connecting with the
community decreases the
risk of harmful behaviors
like substance abuse.

MOMENT THAT MATTERS
Veterans select health
care coverage according
to their individual set of
needs and preferences,
often choosing private
healthcare over VA
unless they seek care and

Not all Veterans are the same and there is no “one” veteran. There are,
however, a broad set of shared moments many Veterans will encounter
and live through. Different Veteran personas will experience and navigate
these moments in varied and disparate ways. Using this journey as a
guide to organize and align around, VA can plan for and design better
experiences for Veterans.

Life events impact individual goals and change priorities. Events like
marriage, divorce, widowhood, birth of a child, obtaining a new degree,
loss of housing, empty nesting, major illness and so on have profound
effects on people’s priorities and how they approach their lives—as
well as how they interact and perceive services. These events are
unpredictable and may happen at any point across this journey.

The Journey of Veterans map is project by the Veterans
Experience Office.

The Veterans Experience team traveled across the
country to meet and learn more about Veterans from all
eras and branches of service. We listened to stories about their
diverse military experiences and lives as Veterans. The stories we
heard emphasized Veterans’ deeply positive relationships with
VA, an organization dedicated to the well-being of Veterans and
their families. We also heard about opportunities to improve the
way VA delivers benefits and services, so we might form trusting
lifelong relationships  with Veterans on their own terms.

The purpose of this effort is to catalyze action through analysis
of customer insights, so we can align what we do with the needs
and expectations of who we serve.
