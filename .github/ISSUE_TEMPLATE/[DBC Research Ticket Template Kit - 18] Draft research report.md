### Further information
**Creating the document**
- Most researchers prefer to work in a collaborative document tool, like Word on Sharepoint, or Google docs, while drafting the research report.
- To move the Platform template into Google docs, follow these steps:
   1. Create a new Google doc
   2. Open the platform template, click the Edit button
   3. Select all the markdown text in the document and copy it
   4. Back in the document tool, choose Paste from Markdown, if available.
- You don’t have to follow the exact template. Remove sections that are not relevant to this study
   - Some elements of the report may not apply to your research. Include product outlines, KPIs, etc if you have them. It can be as simple as linking to a document that already exists. For both KPIs and product outlines, links to the superepic related to your research is sufficient.
