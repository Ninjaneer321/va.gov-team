# VFS Custom Event Form

### What this form is for.
In prepration for the migration to GA4, we need information on _all_ custom events used by your products so we can continue to track them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please fill out this document and the attached spreadsheet as soon as possible, but no later than **Friday, March 15.** The final deadline where Universal Analytics will stop collecting data is **June 30th, 2024**, so we are trying to ensure tracking coverage _well_ before that date.

Please reach out to the **#_vfs-analytics_** Slack channel if there are any questions.
