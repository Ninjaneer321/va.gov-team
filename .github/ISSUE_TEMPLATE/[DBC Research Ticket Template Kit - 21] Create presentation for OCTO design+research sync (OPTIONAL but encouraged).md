### Description
This ticket covers creating a presentation to share the [study name] study in the Digital User Experience Weekly Design Sync. The study focuses on [brief description of study]. 

Here are some tips for creating the presentation:
- Presentations typically take 15-20 minutes plus time for a few questions. Make sure you don’t have too much material to present.
- When deciding what to present, think about both specific research findings and more general learnings (such as learnings about the research process itself) which may be helpful to people on other teams.
- Set clear context for the research you’re presenting. Most people outside of our crew aren’t familiar with our products. You may want to include screenshots of testing prototypes.
- It’s helpful to mention what’s next for your work.

#### Timeframe for this ticket
This ticket should take well under a single sprint.
