## About Design Intent 

The [Design Intent touchpoint](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/design-intent) is a synchronous half-hour discussion focused on design decisions. This meeting ensures you’re building a product that meets VA.gov standards before you’ve done any high-fidelity work on artifacts or prototypes.
