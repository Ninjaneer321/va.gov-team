### Description
This ticket covers working with Research Ops and Perigean to recruit and schedule Veterans for the [study name] study. The study focuses on [brief description of study]. 

The recruiting process typically takes a week, but it may go faster or slower depending on recruiting criteria.

The recruiting process is kicked off when Research Ops has approved the research materials and the research ticket has been moved to the Current column in the research repo board.

When Perigean shares the roster of people they’ve recruited, check that against your recruiting criteria.
