# VFS Report Audit: Report Inventory Form

### What this form is for.
In preparation for the transition to GA4, we need information on all actively used reports that use Universal Analytics (UA) data. This is needed to identify the best ways to assist teams with transitioning their GA reporting. These reports may include a dashboard in GA or Domo, a Looker report, a direct link into a filtered UA interface report, or some other way tool.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please complete this form as soon as possible, but no later than **Friday, April 26.** The sunset date for Universal Analytics is **July 1, 2024**, which means reports that rely on UA as a data source will stop collecting new data on this date. If reports exist within UA itself, they will disappear.

---

### Instructions:
**Step 1:** Please provide the following information on each actively used report your team uses that contains UA data at the bottom of this ticket, or, if it's easier, attach a spreadsheet.
- Report Name
- URL Link
- Reporting Platform (Domo, GA, etc.)
- Description of Report (or how it is used)
  
**Step 2:** Include your team within the title of this form.

**Step 3:** Submit this form.

_Our team will follow up with you for any next steps._
