# Paperless Delivery Staging Review Artifacts  

### Staging URL
- TBD

### Test Users & scenarioes
All users should see the new Communication Settings box in the Profile Hub and a link to the new Paperless Delivery Settings page. That can be tested with any user.
- LOA1 user who should be prompted to verify their account - Signup and create an account in Staging via id.me and it will be LOA1. For example you could do vagovtest+myloa1@gmail.com (you would need to control vagovtest@gmail.com to retrieve MFA code) but in general it just needs an email so you can go through idme.
- Not signed in user who should be prompted to sign in with their verified account - no test user needed
- LOA3 user who is enrolled in healthcare | vets.gov.user+1@gmail.com	
- LOA3 user who is not enrolled in healthcare | vets.gov.user+78@gmail.com
- LOA3 user who doesnâ€™t have a contact email on file | vets.gov.user+78@gmail.com	(you can also go to /contact-information on any test user and remove their contact email)
- LOA3 user who has opted-in to paperless delivery | TBD but let's use vets.gov.user+1@gmail.com if we  can
- LOA3 user who has not opted-in to paperless delivery | TBD but let's use vets.gov.user+66@gmail.com	if we can because this users is also enrolled in healthcare
