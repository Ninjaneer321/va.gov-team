### **Recommended design changes** 

Based on the results of the paperless delivery research conducted with Veterans we propose that the following directions, changes, and enhancements be implemented to the paperless design.

**Recommendation 1: Add a message to the paperless delivery page letting Veterans know they can download or print any document.**\
\
**Finding from RQ3:** Some Veterans are hesitant to receive certain documents digitally, especially when they need an official copy, quick access, or extra reassurance.

**Quotes:**

_“No, because I can just print it out if it comes digitally.” -P4\
\
“I print one off the website because it gives an up to date data.” -P2_

_“I print things out and bring them with me from the va, because some of the medications have names that I'm not a doctor, so it's very hard to pronounce.” -P19_

**Recommendation 2: Add more detail to the in-line confirmation message so Veterans feel confident about what settings were saved and know what to expect next.**

**Finding RQ9:** Veterans trusted the change but often double-checked to confirm.

**Quotes:**

_“And then a notification says, are you sure this is the preference? Say, or something that describes the preference.” - P11_

_“I think I would have expected a little pop up window to be like, hey, you're going back to paper. Are you sure? And I'm like, yes, I do want paper. And that's it.” -P7_

**Recommendation 3: Use defined categories to make it clearer which documents will be included in paperless delivery.**

**Finding RQ10:** However, a few participants thought they were opting in to stop receiving ALL paper documents and paper alerts when in reality they were only selecting one document (1095-B).\
\
**Finding RQ11:** Overall, both designs were usable. Including clear labels and visual grouping seemed to help improve usability for either option.

**Quotes:**

_“I think I like checkboxes… it links all the categories together… easier to read.” -P18_

_“Like, per category. Like, I don't want you to send me my appointment notifications...” -P7_

_“That means that everything. I wouldn't get any more paper copies. It would all come through text or email.” -P10_

**Recommendation 4: Update the text next to the checkboxes to make it clear why Veterans will always get their documents online and why there isn’t a paper-only option.**

**Finding RQ7:** Some expected to see an option to receive only paper mail, which wasn’t available.

**Quotes:**

_“Do you wish to receive only paper or only digital correspondence or both or whatever.” -P11_

_“Because right here you're saying, send me both paper and unless you're going to put a little another circle around here and put. Just send paper only.” -P4_

**Recommendation 5: Send a text or email confirmation with a link whenever settings are changed.**

**Finding RQ9:** Veterans trusted the change but often double-checked to confirm.\
\
**Finding RQ12:** Most Veterans expect to receive a confirmation message after changing their delivery settings—especially via email. Some prefer a message that includes details about what was changed and when. This helps build trust in the system and serves as a reference point for future verification.

**Quotes:**

_“One of the things I might do is I might go to another screen and come back to see if it still is… showing that I'm opted.. in.” - P19_

_“Yes, I would. I'd like to get an email that said my settings have been changed.” -P2\
\
“Maybe a text or an email… ‘This is to confirm that you have selected to go paperless for the 1095-B form.’” -P17\
\
“It would probably be good to get an email or something, just so you know that you made that change.” -P13\
\
“I’ve gotten an email that says you have selected paperless delivery for this account.” -P18\
\
“I think there’s one that says, ‘If you didn’t make these changes, please notify us.’”-P2_

**Recommendation 6: Send a text or email when new documents are ready, and include a link to help Veterans get to them easily.**

**Finding RQ13:** Yes, Veterans expect to be notified when new documents are available digitally. Most prefer receiving alerts by **email, text message, or both**, depending on their communication preferences. Many emphasized that **text alerts help them act faster**, especially when emails may get overlooked in crowded inboxes. 

**Finding RQ14:** While most Veterans are comfortable using digital systems, several expressed concerns about trust, security, or the need for clearer communication. Some worried about missing documents due to unclear labeling or lack of notifications, while others mentioned wanting proof of changes or confirmation. Concerns about overlooked emails and uncertain system reliability also contributed to hesitation.

**Quotes:**

_“I honestly prefer a text notification… if it’s just in my email, the odds of that thing getting lost in there…” -P7\
\
“I like that it says they’ll send an email every time they add a new document. It would be nice to have a text option too.” -P7\
\
“If there’s new communication… it would be great to receive a text just… notifying you, like, ‘Hey, you have new communication on_ [_VA.gov_](http://va.gov)_.’” -P16\
\
“As long as I can choose how I’m being notified, that’s fine… I’d probably pick both.” -P7\
\
“A simple email to my main email address would be great.” -P21_

_“Go to this link below so you can see all the notes and the results. And then you click on there, sign into my VA and it takes you straight to the documentation.” -P11_

**Recommendation 7: Provide in application guidance to settings with links.**

**Finding RQ14:** While most Veterans are comfortable using digital systems, some worried about missing documents due to unclear labeling or lack of notifications, while others mentioned wanting proof of changes or confirmation. Concerns about overlooked emails and uncertain system reliability also contributed to hesitation.

**Quotes:**

_“Go to this link below so you can see all the notes and the results. And then you click on there, sign into my VA and it takes you straight to the documentation.” -P11_

_“When I go directly to Settings, something will pop up and say that, you know, you can get this paperless. You don't have to.” -P19_

**Recommendation 8: Group the contact information, notification settings, and paperless delivery options closer together on the profile page to make them easier to find. Add clear explanations to help Veterans understand the difference between a mailed notification and a mailed document or update.**

**Finding QR6:** Additionally, some expected their delivery preferences to be located closer to their contact information.

**Finding RQ7:** Others were confused about the difference between contact info, notifications, and paperless delivery.

**Quotes:**

_“Because I think this page is kind of cumbersome anyway. I think this could be laid out a lot better because it's like, I think there should be options for each. \[text, email, paper]” -P13_

_“I do wish it had been up underneath the contact information, but I mean, it's not the end of the world. I found it still.” -P7\
\
“Like, if there's a lot of stuff in here, then maybe having the two separate sections is. Is fine. But I think if one link here might make it a little easier to understand.” -P8_

_“I think that it's good that it's labeled separately because I think sometimes people are looking for that like paperless option” -P7_

_“But then, I mean, I would still need that preference between text and email. So it being separate is a little bit wonky. Or like if say you had something that was completely paper notifications and you're not getting text or emails because you didn't already check that box.” -P7_

_“I think paperless settings is kind of like a setting on its own… You opt in.” -P16_

_(When asked what paperless delivery would apply to) “So I would say my notifications, my appointment notifications, my education status for GI Bill or VR and E or whatever. I'm using my messages from providers appointments.” -P11_

**Recommendation 9: Update the future design so it supports bulk selection.**

**Finding RQ11:** Some participants expressed that they would like the option to bulk select paperless option settings when interacting with the prototypes.

**Quotes:**

_“I'm assuming that each of these bold headers here would be other things too, like medical appointments, and so that they would have the option to. To shut that off or I would default it as off, actually.” -P8_

_“There could probably be like an all paperless delivery and then maybe something that's like, if there's a specific form you want mailed to you, maybe go to that specific page. You know what I mean?” -P13_

_“I think this is great that you give the options, but instead of having somebody having to check 18 of them or however many there are any. If you. Above Health care. You had make make all notifications or make, make, you know, switch to paperless delivery.” -P2_

__**Recommendation 10: Change the wording to make it clear that Veterans can update their settings anytime.**

**Finding RQ7:** One participant wasn’t sure if they’d be able to change their preferences again after updating their settings.

**Quotes:**

_“Well, it says update saved with a check mark. Well, I. I feel pretty confident. But what I don't see here is what if I change my mind? I gotta go back to my father and he says, no, no, no, I want paper.” -P18_
