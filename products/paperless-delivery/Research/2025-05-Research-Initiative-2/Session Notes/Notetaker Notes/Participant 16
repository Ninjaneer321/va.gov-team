## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What device will you be using today?

   1. Windows

2. What browser are you using?

   1. Edge

3. First can you tell me if you have a VA.gov account?

   1. No, his wife has one.

4. When do you log into your VA.gov account? What prompts you?

   1. He handles most of her VA communication. It’s mainly him. Sometimes her.

   2. Logs in weekly 

   3. Prompted by benefits - medical. Going to the VA quite often.


## **First Task: Feelings toward Digital Communication - 5 minutes**

Interest in Digital Communications

- Are you interested in receiving all or some of your documents like the 1095-B tax document, decision letters, or other communications only digitally on VA.gov and not receiving paper copies by mail? Why or why not?

  - Yes

  - Doesn’t think they receive helpful or useful physical mail

- Is there anything that would make you more likely to choose digital communication only and not receive paper mail?

  - Just as long as it’s available. Digital is their preference.

Hesitation to Digital Forms

- Can you tell me a little about how you typically receive important forms or communications? (e.g. through physical mail, email, etc.)

  - Banking communication is email

- What made you feel confident or unsure about those experiences? (e.g. privacy, security, reliability, ease of access)

  - Feels confident because he is used to using email. At times you need to double check that things didn’t go to junk or spam but for the most part digital comms are reliable. Finds comfort in using email

  - Paper mail is less useful. You’re never going to respond to paper mail with a letter.

  - Not really concerned with security. If he felt like there was a security issues with his bank, he wouldn’t be banking with them.

- Is it difficult for him to get his wife’s communication?

  - They use a joint email so it’s pretty easy to access things on behalf of his wife

- Are there any VA documents or other communication you would prefer to receive by physical mail vs only digitally on your VA.gov account? Why?

  - No. Even with the most confidential things (health related) he would feel more comfortable receiving that digitally than in the email

- Would you feel comfortable printing a copy yourself instead of having it mailed to you?

  - Yes, definitely.

- Do you have any concerns about switching to digital communication?

  - No, glad if that were to happen.


### **Things to watch for:**

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to receive digitally

  -

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would NOT like to receive digitally

- Note any documents, letters, or communications the participant would like to continue receiving via paper.


## **Second Task: Existing Usability and Navigation Mental Models - 5 minutes**

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you emails or texts — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Settings, Account Settings, not necessarily Your Profile > Notifications

    - If there is anew communication added to [va.gov](http://va.gov), want to be notified about it

- If you wanted to control how a company sends you physical mail — where would you navigate to control that? What kinds of settings would you look for?

  - Same area. Paperless Settings. It’s a setting on its own separate from notifications. You opt in.

- Go ahead and log in to your VA.gov account. Now, talk me though where you’d expect to go and what you would expect to see to stop receiving the 1095-B tax form by mail. Please share your thoughts out loud. As you are navigating, if there is a section you would expect to exist, share what you are looking for out loud.

  -


## **Third Task: Usability and Navigation \[Prototype] - 10 minutes**

- We will now provide a prototype for you to interact with. This prototype has limited functionality so do not expect all buttons to work. As you navigate through the prototype please share any thoughts, frustrations, or points of confusion.

- Navigate to where you would expect to update your delivery preferences.

  -

- Based on what you see here, what delivery settings are selected for this account?

- What documents would these settings apply to?

  -

- How do you feel about being auto opted in to paperless delivery?

  -

- How would you define what ‘paperless settings’ are? (expected response: they will not receive mail but instead will access documents on [VA.gov](http://va.gov))

  -

- Can you think of any other names that would make more sense to you than ‘paperless settings’?

  -

- Now, imagine you would like to change your delivery preferences, talk me through how you would expect to do that.

  -

- Update the prototype to receive paper mail.

- After updating your preferences, how confident do you feel that your changes have been saved?

  -

- Optional - If participant expected a confirmation: Can you describe what steps you would take if you did not receive a confirmation?

  -

- Now that you updated your preferences, how will you receive your 1095-B?

  -

- When do you think your updated preferences will start taking effect?

  -

- How easy or difficult was it to interact with the prototype on your device?

  -

- I will now provide an alternative view (radio or checkbox) of the paperless delivery page for you to opt in to paperless delivery on.\

## **Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes**

- After seeing this prototype, is there anything that might make you hesitate or decide not to sign up for paperless delivery?

  -

- If you had a magic wand and could make any changes to the way the VA communicates with you what would that be?

  -

- Do you have any additional feedback on the process or terms we discussed today?
