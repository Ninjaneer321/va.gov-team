## Overview
This project's objective is to allow State and Tribal Organizations to claim interment (plot) allowances for eligible Veterans buried in a State Veteran's cemetery or on Tribal Trust land, where the burial costs are not covered by other means.

## Problem Statement
State and Tribal Organizations complete VA Form 21P-530a in order to receive a plot or interment allowance for a deceased Veteran who was buried in a State-owned cemetery, Tribal Trust land, or a section of a cemetery dedicated to Veterans. 

How might we provide a way for state and tribal organizations to submit a request for interment (plot) allowance?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- State and Tribal organizations can submit an interment allowance request.

## Undesired User Outcomes

- State and Tribal organizations will prefer submitting a paper request.


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Employees at the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) are able to process requests quicker

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- There is an increased time in processing requests

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
