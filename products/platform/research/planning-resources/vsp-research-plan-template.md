# Research Plan for [Team, Product, Date]

## Goals	
1. What product [tool/service/document/process] & VSP team are you doing this research for? (VSP teams: Product Support, Content & IA, Insights & Analytics, Operations, Service Design, Front-End Tools, Back-End Tools, Identity, Design System, Testing Team, Contact Center Team)
	
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? Link to the product outline.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	


## Method	
What method of research are you planning? 	
Sample Methodologies: Directed interviews; ethnographic interviews; contextual inquiry; card sorts; tree tests; guerilla usability testing; usability testing with low- or high-fidelity prototypes;
Also mention: in-person moderated, remote moderated, remote unmoderated

  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (Zoom, GoToMeeting, etc.)*	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Tool, process, design, documentation, etc. Provide links if possible.)* 	

## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	
(Mention: Number of participants, practice areas, VFS team, VFS product. Please keep in mind that we have a limited number of VFS teams, and we should avoid going to the same people and teams back-to-back.)
2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(Usually it is a Slack message directly to the team or team members. Contact the Design Lead if you need help getting in touch with anyone.)	
## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(Schedule your research at least 1 week in advance if possible to give your participants time to organize their calendars) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 	
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Keep in mind that VFS team members are also remote and live in different time zones. Try and keep research sessions during normal working hours.	
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need help finding someone to take notes for you, contact the Design Lead** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**	

## Resources	
- Project Brief: 	
*Project brief should live in the appropriate va.gov-team product folder, simply paste a link to it here*	
- Convo Guide	
*Discussion guide should live in the appropriate va.gov-team product folder, simply paste a link to it here*	
- Synthesis	
*Link to any documents used for synthesis (Mural or Realtimeboard boards, excel sheets, other data outputs, etc.)* 	
- Lessons Learned	
*Did you have any takeaways from the process of this research round that you want the team to remember for the future? Document them here.* 	
- Read-Out/Results	
  - *Read-out presentation should live in the appropriate product repo and folder; paste a link to it here.*
