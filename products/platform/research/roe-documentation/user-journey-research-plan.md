# Research Plan - VFS User Journey Gaps and Pain Points

## **Goals**

Our goal is to identify pain points and gaps in the VSF User Journey so that we can prioritize validation and solutioning in future sprints. 

Gaps in the journey will be gathered from the VSP Team, while pain points will be heard from VFS teams.

Background:

- We have just begun to document the VFS User Journey. It will continue to be iterated on as we learn more throughout this process.



## **Hypothesis**

Gaps in the VSP process and documentation lead to pain points on the VFS teams.



## **Method**

- Survey members of the VSP team in the [insert 3 practice areas] areas that have worked with a VFS team during the Define Phase.

- - Tool: OptimalSort

- Remote moderated interviews with VFS teams that have gone through the Define Phase.

- - Tool: Zoom

We will use surveys to gather information practice areas are creating tools to help the VSP team meet its objectives. Interviews will allow us to gather qualitative feedback to gain a deep understanding of how the VFS team members are feeling throughout the process of building an app. 

[from James] We will use surveys to measure the usability and helpfulness of ROEs documents. Interviews will allow us to ask followup questions and gain a deep understanding of the effectiveness of ROEs throughout the VFS user journey. 



## **Draft Research Questions**

For VSP team

- 



## **Participants and Recruitment**

- Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant? (Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)
- What is your recruitment strategy? (If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)

## **When?**

- Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? (IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)
- Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)
- Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
- Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.
- Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?

## **Team Roles**

Please list the people who will be serving in each role. Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker

- Moderator:
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):
- Participant recruiting & screening:
- Project point of contact:
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Note-takers:
- Observers:

List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work
