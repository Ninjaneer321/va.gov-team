# Research Plan for VSP, Medallia, 2021

## Goals

This study is being conducted by the VSP Contact Center team. The study follows the user feedback tool called Medallia, which is a Veteran Experience Office product within the VSignals suite. 

Veterans and their families need a trustworthy way to provide feedback for the digital services that the VA offers. 

### Usability Study Goals:

- Document and prioritize any outstanding usability issues that might come up when Veterans and their families fill out a feedback survey
- Help VSP and VFS teams understand Veteran priorities when it comes to potential new survey designs
- Measure the success of a proposed design change to the feedback survey's feedback button

### Research Questions:

- Are users able to locate the feedback form easily, on all devices?
- Are veterans able to navigate through the form easily?
- Do veterans understand the questions and answers that are asked of them?
- Do veterans understand how to answer each question?

### Hypothesis

- Veterans will be able to find the proposed button design quicker and easier than the standard Medallia button design.
- The mobile feedback button will perform more successfully than the desktop, due to its proximity to the page's main content.


## Method

We will conduct remote moderated usability testing and directed interviews via Zoom using the Perigean contract. These methods will help us:

- Gather quantitative data on usability of the survey through the usability testing and some of the directed interview questions
  - Discern whether or not the form is easy to locate. This will be measured through calculating button findability success rate and time to find.
- Gather qualitative data on thoughts and impressions via the directed interviews
  - Discern whether or not the form is sufficient regarding the feedback users aim to submit
  - Understand veteran priorities & motivations for submitting feedback

We will be utilizing the digitial prototyping program Figma to perform the usaibility tests over Zoom.

## Participants and Recruitment

We are seeking to perform this test with 12 participants

**Must have for participants**

- Users who have visited VA.gov previously
- We are seeking to perform this usability test with 5 mobile participants. Therefore, five participants who answer *yes* to:
  - Do you prefer to use your mobile device when visiting VA.gov?
  - *Note: if this is too strict of a qualifier, we can ask "Have you visited VA.gov on your mobile device previously?"*

**Good to have for participants**

- Users that have a DSLogon Premium, MHV Premium, or ID.me login
- Since the tests will be utilizing a digital prototyping tool, participants who utilize assisitive technology will not be able to participate.

## When?

**Desired Timeline: February 1-12, 2020**

45 minutes (30 minute session with 15 minute buffer)
