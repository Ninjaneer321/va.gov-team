1. Is it true that if a person is LOA3 verified, VA.gov profile has name, dob, ssn? 
   - **This is mostly correct**.
   - VA.gov profile will always have last name. (and probably a first name, but not always, as not everyone has a first name)
   - VA.gov profile will likely always have full birthday due to the requirements in ID.me and Login.gov, but legacy systems like BIRLS may only have birth month and birth year, but not birth date
   - VA.gov profile may not always have an SSN due to out of country Benefit recepients; Users who sign up with ID.me & login.gov will have an SSN is as it is required; MHV login did not require SSN
   - Forms that use central mail, would be rejected without a first name, or an SSN/File Number.

It outlines how changes (e.g., address, date of death) are managed for consistency and synchronization across VA systems.
