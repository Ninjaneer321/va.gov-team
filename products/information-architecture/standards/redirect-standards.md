### H2:Â Redirect requests and implementation process

If you need to implement a redirect, a request must first be submitted to VA.gov Information Architecture.  This request will ensure the redirect is valid and accurate, and will kick-off processes to ensure all internal links are appropriately updated. 

[Submit a Redirect or URL change issue on GitHub > ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new/choose)

More information on implementing redirects is available on the [VA Platform documentation site](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/).
