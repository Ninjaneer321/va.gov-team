# Entry Point Implementation
Entry points are an important findability element and a way for users to access your product. Typically, IA will deliver entry points recommendations in the IA spec and will divide up the entry points by three types.

## Types of entry points

### Primary entry point
The primary entry point is a static page on VA.gov with relevant information to the product you are launching. This is where the CTA will be added. Product teams must add the primary entry point prior to staging review.


### Secondary entry point
Secondary entry points are additional ways to to access a product. These consist of the megamenu, left navigation or benefit hub page. Not all products will be added to all three areas and IA can support to determine these additional entry points.

### Crosslinks
Crosslinks are links from other pages to this tool. These aren't required, but can assist in helping users get to the right page they are looking for. IA can make crosslink recommendations, but Sitewide Content leads this task as they have thorough knowledge on content in VA.gov as well as access to auditing tools. Crosslinks are also iterative and can change depending on page performance and other factors.
