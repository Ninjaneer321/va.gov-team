## IA responsibiities in content migration

Content migration efforts are primarily led by the content team members.  However, IA plays an important role in this effort to ensure new content pages are properly structured and placed within the modernized site, redirects are properly handled, and recommendations are given to the business line to ensure the legacy area of the site is not left in pieces.

### IA responsibilities
- Participate in kick-off meeting to understand scope of work, timing, and stakeholder relationships
  - Inform stakeholder that as part of this work we will provide some recommendations to update their site and left nav to accomodate the moving of pages
- Review audit and content placement decisions
- Document redirects and communicate them with stakeholders
- Audit the remaining legacy site content/left nav and document recommendations
  -   Document left nav options
  -   Document any child pages that are left behind (i.e. sometimes a parent page is migrated but a child page is not - that has to be carefully accounted for in redirects, as well as ensuring that visitors can still navigate to the page)
  -   Draft recommendations for the legacy site
- Present recommendations for legacy site changes
