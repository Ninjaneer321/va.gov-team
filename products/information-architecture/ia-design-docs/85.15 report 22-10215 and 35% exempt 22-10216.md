**STATUS: [In progress]**

**Team:** [govcio-vebt]

**People:** PO - Darla van Nieukerk OCTO, Design - Ariana Adili govcio-vbet, IA - Sam CAIA

[**CAIA Intake for 35% exemption request from 85/15 reporting requirement form 22-10216**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/92587) 
[**IA Review for 85/15 reporting form 22-10215:** ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/92142)

CAIA can only offer detailed support (e.g. URLs, breadcrumbs, content, etc.) for pages that are veteran-facing, due to capacity constraints. So the recommendations here are brief.


**On this page:**
- [Location](#location)
- [Header and footer](#header-and-footer)


## <a name="location"></a>Location<br>

- The 85/15 reporting form and the 35% exemption form should live on the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page. 
- We recommend following the existing patterns on the the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page when adding these new forms, and any associated content. CAIA can only offer detailed support (e.g. URLs, breadcrumbs, content, etc.) for pages that are veteran-facing, due to capacity constraints.
- Information about these forms doesn't need to be included or cross-linked from any pages in the veteran-facing experience, since the  audience for this info is school administrators, rather than veterans.



## <a name="header and footer"></a>Header and footer<br>

- We generally recomment using the [minimal header](https://design.va.gov/components/header/header-minimal) and [minimal footer](https://design.va.gov/components/footer/footer-minimal) patterns, for child pages of the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page.
