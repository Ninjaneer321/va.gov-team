## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
 For phase 1 we're just covering findability of existing resources from the family member hub.
 ![Screenshot of very basic user flow showing findability](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/085432ab-17ad-4982-a2d7-7486c333ad35)


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
The family member hub will contain 6 subhubs.

One of the subhubs will actually just be the home loans page, which we need to migrate in family hub.

We will also include the pages for Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFG) in the family member hub structure for phase 1.

2. **Left Nav** - [Add/Modify/Remove]
For phase 1, we will have a left nav for the subhubs and PCAFG. Note the suggested order below, but open to coordination with content fo sho.

![Screenshot of left nav order](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/0f7479f4-aa63-4f4a-a57e-cbfe07d5a362)

3. **Crosslinks**
For phase 1, each subhub will feature links and a short description to the following things. This is probably best viewed directly in [mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1684260449054/7d2a6588b6861b0fb19a31d73cad49fe1a5abd3d?wid=0-1712161880616).

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
We'll need to create a redirect ticket after we finalize H1s (and thus urls). All of the redirects should happen on the same day and should be either at the same time as publishing or right after.
