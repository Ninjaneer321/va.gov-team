## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
 For phase 1 we're just covering findability of existing 'Apply' resources from the family member hub. We are not covering 'manage' resources for Phase 1.

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
The family member hub will contain 6 subhubs.

One of the subhubs will actually just be the home loans page, which we need to migrate in family hub.

We will also include the pages for Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFG) and CHAMPVA in the family member hub structure for phase 1.

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
We'll need to create a redirect ticket after we finalize H1s (and thus urls). All of the redirects should happen on the same day and should be either at the same time as publishing or right after.
