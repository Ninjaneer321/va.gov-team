# IA design for secure messaging tool

**Product/Feature:** Secure Messages

**Change log/updates:** 
- 08/2025 - Sara - Updating the "start a new message" flow in order to prepare for integration with Oracle Health EHR system data
- 06/2025 - Sara - MHV Classic version of SM is being sunset on 6/4/2025 - users will be redirected to SM on VA.gov.
- 05/2025 - Sara - Beginning to plan for the integration of OH/Cerner users in the new version of the tool.

New features also include surfacing recent recipients and updated UI for editing contact lists (VistA only).

- For phase 0, people will enter the tool via email invite only. There will be no entry points within VA.gov. Additional entry points will be added as the new tool is opened up to more visitors.  
- The secure messaging tool will live within the My Health patient portal when it launches. In the meantime, secure messaging will be a standalone tool on VA.gov.
- The phased launch and entry point requirements are documented in the [Phased roll-out - UX and flow impacts mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1667322271773/26b9a1c19e3d4f1dbcc1dba4e4218a56f0fbb75a)
