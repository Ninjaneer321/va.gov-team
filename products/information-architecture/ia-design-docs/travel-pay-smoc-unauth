## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
 
Teams must launch with at least one entry point that allows site visitors to navigate to the new content or feature. 
 
### Required entry point(s) for launch
 
Content will determine where the tool should be cross-linked from but there's no impact to menus in the Health Care hub.
This entry point already exists but will need to update the navigation labels in the left nav and universal nav

 ****
  - Placement description: Breadcrumb
  - Link details
    - Link label: File travel pay reimbursement
    - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/health-care/file-travel-pay-reimbursement/
  - Notes:
    - Who will update (IA, content, product team): IA
    - When will this entry point go live (at launch? After staged rollout? after some designated time?): Can go live now
 
### Additional key entry points
_Any additional key locations that the page should be navigable from. Although these are not required for launch, they are critical to the findability of your content/feature.  Examples of key entry points include "About a form" pages, additional navigation component (top, left) placements, additional static pages where its prominently linked from, etc._
 
 
##  <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience.* 
 
**For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=redirect-request.md) at least 2 weeks in advance.**  
 
None
 
## <a name="bestbets"></a>Search best bets
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. Best bets are not implemented for every page, and not intended to be permanent.  They can aid in helping visitors find key content and features that are not ranking search well or competing with similar pages in search results. Existing best bets must be removed or updated when links/URLs change.*
