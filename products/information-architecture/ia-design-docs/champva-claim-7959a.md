## <a name="flows"></a>Navigation/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will navigate to and flow through the experience for all impacted visitors typies. This helps identify key entry points and findability requirements, user flow scenarios, and content/messaging needs across various scenarios.*

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

- The existing [CHAMPVA benefit page](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/) will serve as the parent page to all information and tasks related to the CHAMPVA program.
- Child pages of the CHAMPVA benefit page will include the application form, the OHI form, and the claim form.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**1) ADD NEW CHAMPVA claim form**
- URL: va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/file-champva-claim-10-7959a/
- Breadcrumb: Va.gov home > Family and caregiver benefits > Health and disability benefits for family and caregivers > [10-7959a form H1]
- Mobile breadcrumb (throughout the form, starting on /introduction): < Health and disability benefits for family and caregivers



## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
On 5/29 we confirmed with Mikki and Danielle that we WILL NOT be adding this form to the left nav for the launch. This is because the strategy for the family member hub left nav is to only include pages related to getting benefits. The ultimate destination for the claim form is within a cohesive authenticated experience (ex: think about the portal you use for health insurance -- filing an out-of-network claim is in that portal, not the general unauth website for the insurer). However, if we determine from 1) analytics or 2) feedback from users or the call center that users are unable to find the claim form, we can reconsider left nav placement.
    

1.**Add to 'Do I need to file a claim / how to file a claim' R+S page**
  - Placement description: TBD by content
  - Link label: [TBD based on H1]
  - Link destination: va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/champva/file-claim-10-7959a/

2. **MODIFY Find-a-Form page**
  - Placement description: we’ll need to add a link to the new online form from this page.
  - Link label: TBD by content
  - Link destination: va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/health-and-disability/file-champva-claim-10-7959a/
