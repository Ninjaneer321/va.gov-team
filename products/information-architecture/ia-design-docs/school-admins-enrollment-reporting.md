*Note: CAIA can only offer detailed support (e.g. URLs, breadcrumbs, content recommendations, etc.) for pages that are veteran-facing, due to capacity constraints. So the recommendations here are brief, and the URL options are more in the spirit of suggestions.*

## <a name="location-of-forms"></a>Location of forms<br>

- The 85/15 reporting form and the 35% exemption form should live under the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page. 


## <a name="H1 and URL"></a>H1 and URL<br>

Refer to the design system's guidance for [page titles and section titles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles) and [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/) when finalizing the form pages' H1s and URLs.

Some suggestions:

**85/15 form**
- **H1:** Report 85/15 Rule enrollment ratio
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/report-85-15-rule-enrollment-ratio/

OR

- **H1:** Submit 85/15 Rule reports
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/submit-85-15-rule-reports/

  
**35% form**
- **H1:** Request 35% exemption from 85/15 reporting
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/request-35-percent-exemption/

*Note on Terminology: I'm leaning toward the term '85/15 Rule' rather than '85% Rule' as the plain language description of this form, for two reasons. '85/15 Rule' is more frequently used, both around the web and in the VA's own supporting documentation. So this is the better option for SEO. And in web searches of VA topics, the string '85%' sometimes describe an individual veteran's disability determinations. It would be good to avoid confusion between education admin terminology and descriptions of individual veterans' disability status, where possible.*

*Note on Form Numbers: Veterans are often familiar with the form numbers for forms they use frequently, so we often include the form number in H1s and URLs. If the form numbers are often referenced by this audience, the form number could be appended to the end of each URL.  For example "/submit-85-15-rule-reports-form-22-10205/".*

*Note on Process: **Once the team has finalized H1s and URLs please let CAIA know.** We'll do a final check to confirmation that they don't create confusion or conflicts with features in the Veteran and Family Member spaces.*


## <a name="Entry Points"></a>Entry Points<br>
 
**1) Find a VA form** - Add Navigation Link
- Placement description: Links on the [Resources for schools ](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/)page.
- Link label: H1 of destination page
- Link destination: URL of destination page


## <a name="header and footer"></a>Header and footer<br>

We generally recommend using the [minimal header](https://design.va.gov/components/header/header-minimal) and [minimal footer](https://design.va.gov/components/footer/footer-minimal) patterns, for child pages of the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page.


## <a name="crosslinks"></a>Crosslinks<br>

Crosslinks from veteran-facing pages are not needed, since the  audience for this info is school administrators rather than veterans.


## <a name="recirects"></a>Redirects<br>

Redirects are not needed, since pages are only being added (not moved or replaced).
