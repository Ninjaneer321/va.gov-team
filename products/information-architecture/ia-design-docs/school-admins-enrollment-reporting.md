*Note: CAIA can only offer detailed support (e.g. URLs, breadcrumbs, content recommendations, etc.) for pages that are veteran-facing, due to capacity constraints. So the recommendations here are brief, and the URL options are more in the spirit of suggestions.*

## <a name="location-of-forms"></a>Location of forms<br>

- The 85/15 reporting form and the 35% exemption form should live under the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page. 
- Consider creating a supporting page for program information and submission process instructions, rather than using the About page for this purpose. The primary function of an About page is as a search tool, rather than an information source. It should provide access to download the pdf form and provide access to the online version, but it is not intended to be a place for instructions around applying or provide program information.
  

## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
Proposed modified flow. The same changes flow apply to both forms, the proposed supporting page is outlined in pink.

## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
With an additional supporting page of information and instructions for each form, the sitemap would look like this. The level 2 pages are the proposed additional pages.

## <a name="H1 and URL"></a>H1 and URL<br>

Refer to the design system's guidance for [page titles and section titles](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles) and [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/) when finalizing the form pages' H1s and URLs.

**Some suggestions:**

**85/15 form, supporting page** - New, proposed by CAIA
- **H1:** 85/15 Rule enrollment ratios
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/85-15-rule-enrollment-ratios/

**85/15 form, form intro page** - New, intro page of form
- **H1:** Report 85/15 Rule enrollment ratios
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/85-15-rule-enrollment-ratio/report-ratios/


  
**35% form, supporting page** - New, proposed by CAIA
- **H1:** 35% exemption from 85/15 reporting
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/35-percent-exemption/

**35% form, form intro page** - New, intro page of form
- **H1:** Request 35% exemption from 85/15 reporting
- **URL:** va.gov/school-administrators/35-percent-exemption/request-exemption/
  
*Note on Terminology: I'm leaning toward the term '85/15 Rule' rather than '85% Rule' as the plain language description of this form, for two reasons. '85/15 Rule' is more frequently used, both around the web and in the VA's own supporting documentation. So this is the better option for SEO. And in web searches of VA topics, the string '85%' sometimes describe an individual veteran's disability determinations. It would be good to avoid confusion between education admin terminology and descriptions of individual veterans' disability status, where possible.*

*Note on Form Numbers: Veterans often know forms they use frequently by form number. So we often include the form number in H1s and URLs. If the form numbers are often referenced by this audience, the form number could be appended to the end of each URL.  For example "/submit-85-15-rule-reports-form-22-10205/".*

*Note on Process: **Once the team has finalized H1s and URLs please let CAIA know.** We'll do a final check to confirmation that they don't create confusion or conflicts with features in the Veteran and Family Member spaces.*



## <a name="Entry Points"></a>Entry Points<br>
 
**1) Find a VA form** - Add Navigation Link
- Placement description: Links on the [Resources for schools ](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/)page.
- Link label: H1 of destination page
- Link destination: URL of destination page


## <a name="header and footer"></a>Header and footer<br>

We generally recommend using the [minimal header](https://design.va.gov/components/header/header-minimal) and [minimal footer](https://design.va.gov/components/footer/footer-minimal) patterns, for child pages of the [Resources for schools](https://www.va.gov/school-administrators/) page.


## <a name="crosslinks"></a>Crosslinks<br>

Crosslinks from veteran-facing pages are not needed, since the  audience for this info is school administrators rather than veterans.


## <a name="recirects"></a>Redirects<br>

Redirects are not needed, since pages are only being added (not moved or replaced).
