### <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. Best bets are not implemented for every page, and not intended to be permanent.  They can aid in helping visitors find content and features that are not easily found or not ranking well in search. Existing best bets must be removed or updated when links/URLs change.*

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco%2C+kristinoletmuskat%2C+strelichl%2C+FranECross&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA%2C+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend%2C+Redirect+request&projects=&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Roll-outs hidden behind a flipper flag need a static page to place a sign in widget or CTA on. Pages/sections where a sign in widget can't be implemented - find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?
