A note about these flows and forms:
**Licenses and Certifications (L&C)**
- VA will reimburse costs for tests to obtain / maintain licenses and certifications.
- Form 22-0803

- VA will reimburse costs for prep courses for taking license and certification tests.
- Form 22-10272

**Higher Ed Tests**
- VA will reimburse costs for national higher-ed tests like SAT and GRE
- Form 22-0810

- VA will reimburse costs for test prep courses for national higher-ed tests like SAT and GRE
- There is **no form** for this - org that runs the course submits enrollment verification directly to VA.

- None of the 3 forms are digitized yet.
