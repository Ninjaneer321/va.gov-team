\See most up-to-date flow in Mural (here) [https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1726160586128/343d813fc6515d2e8b2e88aff56aa6fad4fae52d?wid=132-1726168589170]

A note about these flows and forms:
**Licenses and Certifications (L&C)**
- VA will reimburse costs for tests to obtain / maintain licenses and certifications.
- Form 22-0803

- VA will reimburse costs for prep courses for taking license and certification tests.
- Form 22-10272

**Higher Ed Tests**
- VA will reimburse costs for national higher-ed tests like SAT and GRE
- Form 22-0810

- VA will reimburse costs for test prep courses for national higher-ed tests like SAT and GRE
- There is **no form** for this - org that runs the course submits enrollment verification directly to VA.

- None of the 3 forms are digitized yet.

  -   Form 22-0803 H1 should be updated to: Licensing and certification tests and prep courses
  -   Form 22-0810 H1 should be updated to: National tests and prep courses
  -   Note: both 22-10272 and 22-0803 should direct to the same page, as the L&C page includes two reimbursement forms.
