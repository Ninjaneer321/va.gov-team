## <a name="url"></a>Page URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*


**1) Submit a state or tribal organization request for interment allowance - (form; update to URL and H1)**
- New URL: va.gov/forms/21p-530a/submit-state-interment-allowance-request-online/
- New H1: Submit a state or tribal organization request for interment allowance
- Sub-heading: State or Tribal Organization Application for Interment Allowance (Under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 23) (VA Form 21-530a)
- Breadcrumb: VA forms > State Application for Interment Allowance (VA Form 21p-530a) > Submit a state or tribal organization request for interment allowance
- Notes: The current page title and breadcrumbs match this H1, which was defined in the original IA spec. Per VADS standards, the H1 should match those elements. The form H1 needs to be update to match by using the H1 indicated above.

##  <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*Redirects should be implemented when a page is moved or archived to ensure visitors do not receive a "404 - Page not found" error.*

The product team is responsible for requesting, and implementing any redirects. 

**A redirect will need to be set up for the existing URL, https://www.va.gov/submit-state-interment-allowance-form-21p-530a/, to the updated URL.

The standard process for redirects can be found on the Platform website. Please note that ALL redirects require you to submit a [Redirect Request Issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=redirect-request.md) to be reviewed and approved before implementing. Please submit at least 2 weeks in advance.* 


## <a name="launch"></a>Launch coordination <br>
*Communication when preparing for launch is critical to ensuring all supporting content, links, and messaging are implemented in a timely manner to ensure a good experience. Missing any of these steps can result in findability challenges, incorrect or misleading information, duplicate content, etc. *

Key task | Responsibility | When to complete | Additional info
--- | --- | --- | ---
Communicate when URL changes | product team | Once complete |
Request redirect | product team | When URL changes | 
Update link on entry page | content team | After URL change |
