## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

Teams must launch with at least one entry point that allows site visitors to navigate to the new content or feature. 

### Required entry point(s)

1. **[Page/placement name]**
  - Placement description: 
  - Link details
    - Link label: 
    - Link destination: 
  - Notes:
    - Who will update (IA, content, product team):
    - When will this entry point go live (at launch? After staged rollout? after some designated time?):

### Additional key entry points
_Any additional key locations that the page should be navigable from. Although these are not required for launch, they are critical to the findability of your content/feature.  Examples of key entry points include "About a form" pages, additional navigation component (top, left) placements, additional static pages where its prominently linked from, etc._

1. **[Page/placement name]**
  - Placement description: 
  - Link details
    - Link label: 
    - Link destination: 
  - Notes:
    - Who will update (IA, content, product team):
    - When will this entry point go live (at launch? After staged rollout? after some designated time?):

##  <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience.* 

**For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?template=redirect-request.md) at least 2 weeks in advance.**  

Current URL | Redirect to | Notes
--- | --- | ---
 |  | 


## <a name="bestbets"></a>Search best bets
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. Best bets are not implemented for every page, and not intended to be permanent.  They can aid in helping visitors find key content and features that are not ranking search well or competing with similar pages in search results. Existing best bets must be removed or updated when links/URLs change.*

**1. Best bet for [page name]** - 
- Destination page:
- Additional keywords:

## <a name="launch"></a>Launch coordination <br>
*Communication when preparing for launch is critical to ensuring all supporting content, links, and messaging are implemented in a timely manner to ensure a good experience. Missing any of these steps can result in findability challenges, incorrect or misleading information, duplicate content, etc. *

Key task | Responsibility | When to complete | Additional info
--- | --- | --- | ---
Communicate date of staging review | | Once scheduled |
Submit redirect request | | at least 2 weeks prior to implementation | 
Communicate launch date | | |




### Staged rollout
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Roll-outs hidden behind a flipper flag need a static page to place a sign in widget or CTA on. Pages/sections where a sign in widget can't be implemented - find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

1. What is the team's staged rollout plan?
2. Which page will have the widget that controls views?
3. Does the team need to manage search-engine results during rollout?
