## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows


## <a name="map"></a>Placement within the VA.gov IA



## <a name="urls"></a>URL, breadcrumb, and title guidance

Follow the [VA Design System](https://design.va.gov/) for URL, breadcrumb, and page title guidance.  
- [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/)
- [H1s (Page titles and section titles)](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles)
- [Breadcrumbs](https://design.va.gov/components/breadcrumbs)
- [Title tags](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/title-tags)

Also review [Capitalization](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/capitalization) for standards for headings vs.title tags

**Track your VR&E Chapter 31 benefits**
  - URL:  va.gov/careers-employment/track-your-vre-benefits/
  - Breadcrumb:  VA.gov home > Careers and employment > Track your VR&E Chapter 31 benefits 
    - Per the standard breadcrumb component, the last segment of the breadcrumb must match the H1 of the page exactly
  - Browser title: [H1 of introduction page in title case] | Veterans Affairs
    - Track Your VR&E Chapter 31 Benefits | Veterans Affairs


**Structuring URLs for individual pages within the tool flows**
- All pages within form flows will exist as child pages of the core/canonical URL.
  - Examples:
      - va.gov/careers-employment/track-your-vre-benefits/application-received/
      - va.gov/careers-employment/track-your-vre-benefits/orientation-video/
      - va.gov/careers-employment/track-your-vre-benefits/counselor-appointment/
  - Please refer to [URL standards for form flows](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/#guidelines-for-urls-in-form-flows) when defining the URLs for these pages. This is not a form but follows many of the same principles. Reach out to #content-ia-centralized-team with any questions.


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points
*Entry points are where the primary call-to-action is provided allowing a site visitor to navigate to the page/feature.*

**Please note:** The Governance Team requires a preview link of the primary entry point as a part of staging review in the Collaboration Cycle. It may be a launch-blocking issue. Please work with Content and IA team in advance for these updates.

**1) Careers and employment hub page - va.gov/careers-employment/ -- Required for launch**
  - Link will be placed under "Manage your career and employment benefits" section

**2) Main navigation -- Post launch**
- Link to be placed in Careers and employment mega-menu under "Manage your career" column
