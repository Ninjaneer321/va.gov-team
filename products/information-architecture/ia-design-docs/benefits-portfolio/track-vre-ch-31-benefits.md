## <a name="urls"></a>URL, breadcrumb, and title guidance

Follow the [VA Design System](https://design.va.gov/) for URL, breadcrumb, and page title guidance.  
- [URLs](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/)
- [H1s (Page titles and section titles)](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/page-titles-and-section-titles)
- [Breadcrumbs](https://design.va.gov/components/breadcrumbs)
- [Title tags](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/title-tags)

Also review [Capitalization](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/capitalization) for standards for headings vs.title tags

**Track your VR&E benefits -- new (Drupal entry page, created by content team)**
  - URL:  va.gov/careers-employment/track-your-vre-benefits/
  - Breadcrumb:  VA.gov home > Careers and employment > Track your VR&E benefits
  - **Note: The log in component for the tool will be placed on this page**

**Your VR&E benefit stauts -- new (tool managed by Reapers team)**
  - URL:  va.gov/careers-employment/track-your-vre-benefits/vre-benefit-status/
  - Breadcrumb:  VA.gov home > Careers and employment > Track your VR&E benefits > Your VR&E benefit status
    - Per the standard breadcrumb component, the last segment of the breadcrumb must match the H1 of the page exactly
  - Browser title: [H1 of introduction page in title case] | Veterans Affairs
    - Your VR&E Benefit Status | Veterans Affairs
  - **Note: Use "Veteran Readiness and Employment (Chapter 31)" on first mention in intro body text instead of VR&E**

**Structuring URLs for individual pages within the tool flows**
- All pages within form flows will exist as child pages of the core/canonical URL.
  - Examples:
      - va.gov/careers-employment/track-your-vre-benefits/vre-benefit-status/application-received/
      - va.gov/careers-employment/track-your-vre-benefits/vre-benefit-status/orientation-video/
      - va.gov/careers-employment/track-your-vre-benefits/vre-benefit-status/counselor-appointment/
  - Please refer to [URL standards for form flows](https://design.va.gov/components/url-standards/#guidelines-for-urls-in-form-flows) when defining the URLs for these pages. This is not a form but follows many of the same principles. Reach out to #content-ia-centralized-team with any questions.


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points
*Entry points are where the primary call-to-action is provided allowing a site visitor to navigate to the page/feature.*

**Please note:** The Governance Team requires a preview link of the primary entry point as a part of staging review in the Collaboration Cycle. It may be a launch-blocking issue. Please work with Content and IA team in advance for these updates.
