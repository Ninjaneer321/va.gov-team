## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
![Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 2 59 10â€¯PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f2b780c-e4a2-4ccc-a634-b6712c497f89)


## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**1) Add Contact Info subtask**
- URL: va.gov/my-va/welcome-va-setup/review-contact-info/
- Breadcrumb: VA.gov home > My VA > Review contact information
- Notes: In this case, /welcome-va-setup/ is an empty directory. While we don't typically allow empty directories, we allowed it in this case because the team has concrete intentions to build more subtasks under the /welcome-va-setup/ directory. Note that the breadcrumb skips over that empty directory.



### Sub-URLs
- va.gov/my-va/welcome-va-setup/review-contact-info/mobile-phone
- va.gov/my-va/welcome-va-setup/review-contact-info/email-address
- va.gov/my-va/welcome-va-setup/review-contact-info/mailing-address
- va.gov/my-va/welcome-va-setup/review-contact-info/confirmation



## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

### Navigation pathways and entry point for launch
See more about [navigation pathways and entry points](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/process/entry-points.md). Teams must launch with at least one navigation pathway.

**1) Add/Modify/Remove Page/menu name**
TBD - not sure where to see their latest designs. Not sure what page of their figma to look at, and none of their staging users produce the alerts that guide into this experience.
