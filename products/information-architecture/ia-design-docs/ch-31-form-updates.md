## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

Team's [Mural for Ch 31 user flows](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1684161597392/5c1f8869cf5d03b792c8b82cf19b39dc26c486c2?sender=u79ee90295fdb006d7f463212)


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities. Consider whether a Search Best Bet might be useful if this product enhances a Top Task for veterans.*

### Chapter 31 Entry Points
1. **[About VA Form 28-1900](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-28-1900/)** - Modify
  - Placement description: Update link destination so users are routed directly into the form flow
  - Link label: Go to the online tool
  - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/apply-vre-form-28-1900
  - Notes: Currently, the link directs users to the [How to apply page](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/how-to-apply/). Since users are coming to find a VA form with a specific form in mind, I think it would make sense to update the link so they're able to go right into the form flow.

2. **[Veteran Readiness and Employment (Chapter 31)](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/)** - Add
  - Placement description: Add a link to the form in the left nav as a child page under "Veteran Readiness and Employment". It will be the 4th option down within the other child pages.
  - Link label: TBD by Sitewide Content
  - Link destination: https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/apply-vre-form-28-1900
  - Notes: The URL already represents the form as a child page to "Veteran Readiness and Employment" so we just want to update the left nav so it matches the URL as well as the content on the page.
 

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*A list of any critical redirects needed as part of this product/feature launch. Redirects are required for any URL changes to ensure visitors do not receive a 404 - Page not found error in the experience. For any redirects listed, please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=jennymayoco%2C+kristinoletmuskat%2C+strelichl%2C+FranECross&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+Sitewide+IA%2C+Public+Websites%2C+VA.gov+frontend%2C+Redirect+request&projects=&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance.*

## <a name="bestbets"></a>Best Bets<br>
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. These suggestions are selected for specific terms and are intended to help veterans and their beneficiaries find relevant results quickly. We want to make sure that best bets are not linking to the deprecated page.*

## <a name="stagedrollout"></a>Staged Rollout<br>
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Pages/sections that can't have a widget: find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

**[Which static page has the widget, ie the main entry point?]**
