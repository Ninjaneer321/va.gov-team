## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map).

Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

## <a name="url"></a>Page URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site. This section will also document form or tool flow URLs, titled sub-URLs.*

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

Teams must launch with at least one entry point that allows site visitors to navigate to the new content or feature. 

### Required entry point(s)

1. **[About VA DIC for spouses, dependents, and parents](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/dependency-indemnity-compensation/)**

- Link destination:https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/dependency-indemnity-compensation/marital-status-questionnaire-21P-0537/

### Additional key entry points
_Any additional key locations that the page should be navigable from. Although these are not required for launch, they are critical to the findability of your content/feature.  Examples of key entry points include "About a form" pages, additional navigation component (top, left) placements, additional static pages where its prominently linked from, etc._

1. **About form 21-0537 - new**
- Content to be determined by content team

2. **Family member and caregiver hub left nav**

- The link will be nested in the Survivor and Dependent Compensation branch at the top of the list.
- Menu label: Verify marital status


## <a name="bestbets"></a>Search best bets
*Search “best bets” are suggested pages that appear in the “Our top recommendations for you” section when you perform a search on VA.gov. Best bets are not implemented for every page, and not intended to be permanent.  They can aid in helping visitors find key content and features that are not ranking search well or competing with similar pages in search results. Existing best bets must be removed or updated when links/URLs change.*

**1. Best bet for [page name]** - 
- Destination page:
- Additional keywords:

## <a name="launch"></a>Launch coordination <br>
*Communication when preparing for launch is critical to ensuring all supporting content, links, and messaging are implemented in a timely manner to ensure a good experience. Missing any of these steps can result in findability challenges, incorrect or misleading information, duplicate content, etc. *

Key task | Responsibility | When to complete | Additional info
--- | --- | --- | ---
Communicate date of staging review | | Once scheduled |
Submit redirect request | | at least 2 weeks prior to implementation | 
Communicate launch date | | |




### Staged rollout
*Is the team planning a staged rollout? Roll-outs hidden behind a flipper flag need a static page to place a sign in widget or CTA on. Pages/sections where a sign in widget can't be implemented - find a form pages, within accordions, hub pages*

1. What is the team's staged rollout plan?
2. Which page will have the widget that controls views?
3. Does the team need to manage search-engine results during rollout?
