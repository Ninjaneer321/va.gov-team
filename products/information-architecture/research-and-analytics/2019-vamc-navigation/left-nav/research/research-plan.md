# Research Plan for Global UX, Local Navigation, November/December 2019
## Goals of the research

This is a research project for the Global UX team. It is focused on the local or "left-nav" navigation component design. This is a new design for the left navigation element, and it provides new functionality for local or “left rail” navigation allowing users of VA.gov to more easily browse and understand the contents within a section, and then navigate to desired content within VA.gov. 

This research will explore two spaces: 
1. Is the new local navigation design better than the current navigation design, and 
2. Does the user sufficiently understand the new navigation design to interact with it the way the designer intended? 

This research should address the following questions:
* Do users currently have a hard time finding content in subsections on VA.gov? 
* Does this approach to the design make it easier to find content in subsections on VA.gov? 
* Do users of this design understand how to browse the children of a section without navigating to that section? 
* Do users of VA.gov use the local navigation element as a method ascertaining where they are in the information architecture of VA.gov? 
* Does the new design do a good job of helping users of the design ascertain where they are in the information architecture of VA.gov? 

Hypotheses for this research
* Users of the current local navigation design can not easily find content deeper within the site without engaging in “pogo-stick” behavior, meaning they will click into a third level page and then click back out if it’s not what they were looking for. 
* Users of the current local navigation design cannot make deep lateral moves across parent level sections easily. 
* Users of the redesigned local navigation will find this design helpful in browsing a subsection of a site without going to that subsection and reading the page (e.g. engaging in “pogo-stick” behavior).
* Users of the redesigned local navigation will try to make deep lateral moves across parent-level sections without using the back button or breadcrumbs.
* Users of the redesigned local navigation may or may not understand how to interact with the navigation elements for “parents,” which requires the parent to replicated as a “child” heading beneath the parent upon expansion. 

## Research method

This interview will use a brief ethnographic interview combined with remote moderated usability observation. The usability observation will have two stages: one lightly moderated and customized for that user, and one that is moderated where all test subjects will follow the same task sequence. 

The ethnographic interview will help identify content on the site that the user is likely to seek. The first stage of the usability observation will use tasks identified through the ethnographic interview that are important to the user.  The moderator will not guide the user beyond the initial task framing. The second stage will consist of three to five information seeking tasks that require deep navigation and parent-section-to-parent-section lateral moves. 

This method will allow us to address the two primary questions this research, whether or not the new approach is more effective than the current approach, and whether or not users of VA.gov fully understand the design of the new approach. 

Research will be performed remotely, using Zoom with recruiting via Perigean. 

We will be testing the current site to establish baseline, and a live prototype of the site currently in the staging environment. 
Current: https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care
Prototype of new design: https://staging.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care

Zoom will be the tool that we prefer to use. 

## Research participants and recruitment

* 16 participants (minimum of 8 required) 
* Western PA residents that are Veterans, with some familiarity with Pittsburgh area VA facilities (e.g. they've used one at least once)
* Note: will accept caregivers, but only up to 4

We'll use Perigean recruiting, or we will recruit via the previous relationships with Pittsburgh VA facility visit if necessary. 

## When will the research take place?
