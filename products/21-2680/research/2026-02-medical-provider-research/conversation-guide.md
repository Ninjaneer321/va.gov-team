## 3. Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, I want to tell you what we're doing today.

Today we're going to talk about your experience with VA benefits and healthcare, specifically around a form called 2680 — which is used for Aid and Attendance or Housebound allowance. We're interested in learning how veterans and caregivers like you experience filling out this form and working with your doctor to complete it. It's ok if you have never filled out this form or if it doesn't directly apply to you. We're still interested in your experience and feedback.

Before we start, I have a few things I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any of it.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way. You can also stop at any time if you need a break or decide you don't want to continue.
  
- I know Perigean (the folks who recruited you) asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you comfortable with observers joining us?**
   - **If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
   
- **[Ask observers to give brief introductions]** I'm going to ask my colleagues to give a quick introduction — just their first name and their role with VA.gov. This helps make this more of a human conversation. 
   - Once complete, ask them to **turn off their cameras to save bandwidth** for the rest of the session.
    
- **You'll be looking at a form today** — the digital version of 2680 as it appears on VA.gov. This is a real form that Veterans use, and we want to understand your experience with it. We may ask you to walk through it, or we may just discuss your experience with similar forms.
 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to make sure we've captured your thoughts accurately. After we complete our research, the recording is deleted — we only keep what we learn from talking with people like you. 
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
   
   **[Record answer here: ☐ Yes  ☐ No]**
    
- **One more thing:** Would you be comfortable if we used a short video clip from our conversation with you — maybe 30 seconds to a minute — to help our partners at VA understand what it's like to be a Veteran or caregiver working through these benefits processes? We would remove any information that could identify you, like your name or personal health details.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a short clip from our session?**
   
   **[Record answer here: ☐ Yes  ☐ No]**
   
   - **If yes:** Once I start recording, I'm going to confirm one more time that you're okay with me recording. Just want to make sure we're clear!

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the **Show captions (CC)** button to enable live transcription.

- **I have started recording.** Before we dive in, I want to confirm one more time: **Are you comfortable with me recording my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

 **[Record answer here: ☐ Yes  ☐ No]**

- **And are you comfortable if we use a short recorded clip from today to share with VA partners if we remove any information that could identify you?**

 **[Record answer here: ☐ Yes  ☐ No]**

## 4. Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the form, let's start with a few questions to get to know you a bit better.

**Background & Eligibility:**

1. **Are you a Veteran, or are you a caregiver or family member of a Veteran?** 
   - *[Listen for: their relationship to VA, if applicable]*

2. **Do you currently receive any VA benefits?** 
   - If yes: What type? (Disability compensation, pension, Aid and Attendance, etc. If you prefer not to share, that's ok!)
   - If no: Have you applied for any in the past?

3. **Do you have a service-related disability with VA? (Again, if they prefer not to share, that is ok)** 
   - If yes: What's your rating? 
   - If yes: What was the process like to get that rating?

4. **Do you receive a VA pension?**
   - If yes: What was the process like to apply for that?

**Provider & Healthcare Coordination:**

5. **Do you currently have a medical provider through VA? Do you also have a private doctor outside of VA?**
   - *[Listen for: who they see, how often, comfort level with coordination]*

6. **Let's talk about your typical healthcare experience. When you need help from a doctor — whether it's at VA or somewhere else — how do you usually contact them or set up an appointment?**
   - *[Listen for: phone, patient portal, in-person, etc.]*

7. **Have you ever had to work with a doctor to fill out a VA form — like getting them to sign something or provide medical information for a benefits claim?**
   - **If yes:** Think about the last time you did this. Can you walk me through that experience? What was that process like? 
   - **If no:** That's okay — imagine you need to have a doctor fill out a form for you. Can you walk me through the process? What would you do first? .

8. **What are some of the biggest challenges you face when trying to communicate with your doctor or get them to help with paperwork?**
   - *[Listen for: delays, confusion, unclear instructions, busy providers, etc.]*

## 6. Second Task - General Form Walkthrough & Usability - 15 minutes

**Goal:** Understand the overall usability of the 2680 form, including navigation and flow, field clarity and labels, and instructions and help text.

> Now I'd like you to walk all the way through this form, from the beginning to the end. I'll keep sharing my screen, and you tell me what to do or enter into each field.  You can use fake or placeholder information — we're not collecting real data, we just want to see how you interact with the form and where you might run into confusion. As you go, please talk through what you're doing and what you're thinking. If something doesn't make sense, just let me know.

**Checklist & Observations:**

- [ ] Participant starts at the beginning of the form
- [ ] Participant steps through each section, entering fake/placeholder data
- [ ] Participant reaches the end of the form
- [ ] Ask clarifying questions whenever the participant hesitates or seems confused

**Things to watch for:**

**Form Navigation & Flow:**
- [ ] **Is it clear how to navigate the form?** (Can they find buttons to continue, go back, etc.?)
- [ ] **Does the form flow logically?** (Does the order of questions make sense?)
- [ ] **Are there any unexpected jumps or confusing transitions between sections?**
- [ ] **Do they understand where they are in the form?** (Is progress clear? Step indicators helpful?)

**Field Clarity & Labels:**
- [ ] **Are the form field labels clear?** (Do they understand what information is being asked for?)
- [ ] **Do they understand what type of information to enter?** (Is it obvious if it's text, numbers, dates, etc.?)
- [ ] **Are there any fields they skip or are unsure about?**
- [ ] **Do optional vs. required fields feel clear?**

**Instructions & Help Text:**
- [ ] **Is there helpful guidance on the form?** (Tooltips, hints, explanations?)
- [ ] **If they get stuck, do they know where to find help?**
- [ ] **Are the instructions easy to understand?** (Clear language? Not too wordy?)
- [ ] **Do they use the help text, or do they prefer to figure it out on their own?**

**General Experience:**
- [ ] **What's their overall impression of the form and ease of use?**
- [ ] **Any frustrations or moments where they felt lost?**
- [ ] **Did any of the fields prompt unexpected reactions? (Especially, was there any emotional component to the fields that we should account for.)**
- [ ] **Were there any accessibility issues the user ran into?**

**Sample Probing Questions:**
- "What does this field mean to you?"
- "How did you know what to do there?"
- "Was that instruction helpful?"

- "How are you feeling about the form so far?"
- "Is there anything on this page that confused you?"
- "What's been the easiest part so far? What's been the hardest?"

## 7. Third Task - Understanding the Handoff & Provider Section - 10 minutes

**Goal:** Understand how Veterans/caregivers think about the provider handoff and what happens after they submit their portion.

> Now that we've looked at the eligibility and information you'd need to provide, let's talk about what happens next.

**Checklist & Observations:**

- [ ] Participant reviews the consent/disclosure section (what permission they're giving to share info with provider)
- [ ] Participant reviews the handoff instructions (how to send to provider, what to expect)
- [ ] Participant reviews options for how the provider can return the form (digital, print, fax, etc.)

**Things to watch for:**

- [ ] **Do they understand what "consent to disclose to provider" means?** (That they're allowing VA to share their name and DOB only with the doctor.)
- [ ] **Do they understand their options for HOW to get the form to their provider?** (Email, print it themselves, VA sends it, etc.)
- [ ] **Do they feel confident they can get their provider to complete this?** (Any concerns about the process?)
- [ ] **Do they understand what happens after the doctor fills it out?** (Does it go back to VA automatically or do they need to follow up?)
- [ ] **Do they have any questions or concerns about this process?**

**Sample Probing Questions:**
- "Based on what you're reading here, how would you actually get this form to your doctor?"
- "What if your doctor is slow to respond? What would you do?"
- "What does this consent statement mean in your own words?"
- "Looking at these options, which way would you prefer to send the form to your provider?"
- "How confident do you feel that you could get your doctor to fill this out?"

   - Scale: 1 (not confident at all) to 5 (very confident)
   - Follow-up: Why did you choose that number?
