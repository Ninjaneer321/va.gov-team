## Overview
This project's objective is to allow Veterans and their physician(s) to provide evidence of a veteranâ€™s medical condition and functional status to justify Aid & Attendance or Housebound benefits which increases their monthly compensation or pension benefits.

## Problem Statement
A Veteran who needs daily assistance or experiences confinement to their home due to a disability can complete VA Form 21-2680 "Examination for Housebound Status or Permanent Need for Regular Aid and Attendance" to request an increase in their monthly compensation or pension benefits. This form requires partial completion by the Veteran and the Veteran's physician(s) in order to provide medical evidence that qualifies the Veteran for Aid and Attendance benefits. 

How might we provide a way for both Veterans and their physician(s) to provide this information so Veterans can receive their Aid and Attendance benefits quicker?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans and their physician(s) can submit a request for Aid and Attendance benefits

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans will prefer submitting their request for Aid and Attendnace benefits via the paper form 


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Employees at the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) are able to process requests quicker

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- There is an increased time in processing requests

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
