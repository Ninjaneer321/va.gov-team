# Forms content model

This is a working file to begin to capture structured content for forms.

- **VA form number:** The official number that VA assigns this form. For example, the 10-10EZ or the 526-EZ.
- **Official form name:** This is the official form name. This is often times a lengthy, complex name.
- **Plain language form name:** This is the plain language name we give to the form.
- **OMB number:** This is the OMB number for the form, found on the PDF form.
- **Form revision date:** This is the date the form was last revised, found on the PDF form.
- **Form expriation date:** This is the date the form expires with OMB, found on the PDF form.
- **Respondent burden (or "How long we estimate it will take to complete this form"):** This is the estimated length of time for completing the form (based on the PDF), found on the PDF form.
- **Parent form:** Some forms are "supporting forms" for other forms. We'll want to establish that relationship.
- **Supporting forms:** Same as above, we'll want to establish the supporting form relationship. 
- **Parallel, or combined, form:** We are in the process of combining some forms online, so we'll need a way to address this in the model.
- **Form type:** Let's consider how best to capture form type (i.e. application, etc.).
- **Who can submit this form:** Let's consider how best to capture form audiences/submitter. Some forms will have multiple people who need to fill out the form. 
- **Privacy statement:** Would be great to be able to include the privacy statement in the content model, whether for current or future needs. Possibly other statements/areas like this. Let's consider more.
- **When to use this form:** Plain language instructions on when to use this form.
- **What to know before you fill out this form:** Any specific warnings, disclaimers, etc. a person needs to know before filling out the form. 
- **Information you'll need to fill out this form:** Bulleted list of information and documents you'll need to submit this form.
