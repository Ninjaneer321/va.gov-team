# Research Plan for Learning Center MVP: Veteran Card Sort

Liz Lantz, Public Websites, August 28, 2020

## Goals

The goal of this study is to evaluate the nomenclature for the Learning Center audience and topic labels, and see how those labels are applied to articles by Veterans.

**Research questions**

- Does each audience/topic label make sense to participants? 
- How do participants assign the primary audience and topic labels to articles?
- Have we missed, or mis-labeled, any significant audiences or topics? 
- Do they understand the labels in expected or unexpected ways?

**Hypothesis**

- Veterans will understand what beneficiary labels mean and map them to the relevant article titles. 

- Veterans will understand what topic labels mean and map them to the relevant article titles. 

## Method

We will be creating 2 hybrid, unmoderated studies using OptimalSort (links below):

1. [Card sort to evaluate topic labels](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/eaihc576)
2. [Card sort to evaluate audience labels](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/eaihc576-0)

Each study will contain article titles as the cards, and the labels as the categories. 

## Participants and Recruitment

We'd like to recruit 50 Veterans to participate in this study.

#### **Must have for participants**

Are you a Veteran, a Veteran dependent receiving benefits from the VA, or a Veteran caregiver? (pass = yes)

#### Good to have for participants

- 50/50 female and male participants
- At least 50% identify with a group other than Caucasian
- Diversity across all Veteran age groups in our participant pool
- Diversity across rural and major metropolitan areas
- Diversity across all education levels in our participant pool 
- At least 5 participants who have a disability rating of 70% or greater
- At least 5 participants who identify as having cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.

#### Recruitment requirements

This study requires participants to drag and drop elements.

#### **Recruitment strategy** 

We will use the Perigean contract to recruit Veterans using [this email template.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort-recruit-email.md)  

We have included a required field at the end of both card sorts to collect a code from participants. We expect Perigean to generate and provide that code to participants to track completion and compensation.  

In an effort to have a low abandonment rate, please ensure it is very clear to participants that they need to have this code available when they start the card sort.

**Both** card sorts should be completed for full participation.

## When?

The card sort links will be available on 8/31 and we would like them sent to participants as soon as possible, and no later than September 7th.  They will be in a draft status until this research plan is approved.

Based on the experience of other teams, we anticipate that we'll need to leave the study open for 2 weeks to reach 50 participants.

We estimate it will take participants 15-20 minutes to complete both card sorts.

The card sort links will be tested by a member of the Public Websites team on 8/28/20.

## Team Roles

Since this is an unmoderated study, there will be no team members present for the sessions. Plan and study created by Liz Lantz, liz.lantz@adhocteam.us
