# Research Plan for Learning Center MVP:  SME Card Sort

Liz Lantz, Public Websites, August 31, 2020

## Goals

The goal of this study is to evaluate the nomenclature for the Learning Center audience and topic labels, and see how those labels are applied to articles by subject matter experts or people who create/manage content for Veterans.

**Research questions**

- Does each audience/topic label make sense to participants? 
- How do participants assign the primary audience and topic labels to articles?
- Have we missed, or mis-labeled, any significant audiences or topics? 
- Do they understand the labels in expected or unexpected ways?

**Hypothesis**

- Participants will understand what beneficiary labels mean and map them to the relevant article titles. 

- Participants will understand what topic labels mean and map them to the relevant article titles. 


## Method

We will be creating 2 hybrid, unmoderated studies using OptimalSort (links below):

1. [Card sort to evaluate topic labels](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/eaihc576-1-0)
2. [Card sort to evaluate audience labels](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/eaihc576-1)

Each study will contain article titles as the cards, and the labels as the categories. 

## Participants and Recruitment

We'd like to recruit 50 SME or content author/managers for this study.

#### **Recruitment strategy** 

Jen Lee will send an email out to participants.

**Both** card sorts should be completed for full participation.

## When?

The card sort links will sent on 8/31/2020, and we're asking participants to complete by 9/11/2020.

We estimate it will take participants 15-20 minutes to complete both card sorts.

The card sort links were tested by a member of the Public Websites team on 8/28/20.

## Team Roles

Since this is an unmoderated study, there will be no team members present for the sessions. Plan and study created by Liz Lantz, liz.lantz@adhocteam.us
