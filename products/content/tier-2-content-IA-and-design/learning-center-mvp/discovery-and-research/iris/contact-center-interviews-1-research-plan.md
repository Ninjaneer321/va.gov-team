# Research Plan for IRIS Contact Centers, Initial Interviews

## Goals	

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

   Learning Center MVP, Public Websites

2. Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 

   Call center content authors currently use two things to publish articles:

   - The [Inquiry Routing and Information System (IRIS)](https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/) is a system used to publish external customer articles. It's accessible to Veterans, and also used VA call centers to answer customer service questions.
   - Egain is used to publish internal docs, like scripts for call center reps

   Now that IRIS is going to be retired, Veteran Experience Office (VEO) is in the process of getting the content teams onboarded into Egaines to publish internal and external content on [KnowVa](https://www.knowva.ebenefits.va.gov/system/templates/selfservice/va_ssnew/help/customer/locale/en-US/portal/554400000001018). KnowVA does not align with the modernized experience of VA.gov. 

   All of the existing public facing IRIS content will be migrated into the learning center. We want to support the publication of future call center author content in the learning center, instead of KnowVA.

   In this first round of research, we'd like to talk to contact center teams to better understand the team make-up and get a high level understanding of current content processes, with regard to contact center customer service and IRIS content creation. 

   We'll use what we learn to inform a second round of research that will give us a more in-depth understanding of content management at contact centers.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

   We'll be talking to teams at 6 different call centers (see participants). We'd like to get these questions answered by each team.  Since we only have an hour, some of the more specific questions may get punted to the 1:1 interviews in our next round of research:

   - What is the role of each person in the meeting?
   - What is the size and structure of each content team?
   - Who are the people on these teams, and what are they responsible for?
   - What are the different types of content each team creates and manages, with regard to contact center customer service and IRIS content creation?
   - Who is the audience for their content?
   - What is the process for internal scripts that support contact center reps? 
   - Are they different than the process for customer facing content?
   - What are the processes related to
     - Creating new content?
     - Updating existing content?
     - Retiring existing content?
   - Do they have any content style guides?
   - How does IRIS fit into each center's content flow? 
   - How is content maintained in IRIS?
   - What other systems are being used? 
   - What is the process for reviewing drafts?
   - If they aren't authoring in content in IRIS, what are they using?
   - What's working well for each contact center in terms of content creation and management?
   - What isn't working well?
   - Who can we interview to gain a more in-depth understanding of these processes?
   - Which parts of these content management processes are things we can observe and learn from?
   - Who can we observe going through these processes?

4. Our hypothesis for this research is that:

   - There will be a lot of variance between contact centers in terms of the team structure, size, and processes in place.
   - Some contact centers don't have a formal content management process.
   - Content is maintained in IRIS.
   - IRIS is a major part of their workflow, but there will be some other systems we'll want to observe people working in.

## Method	

1. What method of research are you planning? 	

   This study will begin with moderated group interviews conducted over Zoom.  

   Follow-up interview and contextual inquiry/observation sessions will be scheduled with individuals in our second round of research.

2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

   We're starting with these small-group discussions to get a high-level understanding, and get a few different perspectives. We don't think one person will be able to speak to all of the questions we need answered to move to our next phase of more-detailed research.

## Participants and Recruitment	

The DEPO contact center liaison has identified individuals and contact centers for us to start with.  They've selected these people for us based on their understanding of content creation at their center, and their ability to help us identify the next round of people we need to talk to.  We'll be having small group discussions with people at 6 contact centers. Individuals aren't listed to protect privacy.

- Health Resource Center (HRC, 7 people)

- Veterans Experience Office Tier 1 Contact Center (VEO, 2 people)

- National Cemetery Administration (NCA, 2 people)

- Office of Care Coordination (OCC, 4 people)

- Debt Management Center (DMC, 3 people)

- National Call Center (NCC, 3 people)

   

## When? 	

1. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
   Sessions are scheduled between September 29 - October 9, 2020

2. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?

   1 hour

3. Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

   We won't be doing a pilot for this, as it's mostly conversational and we're not testing anything.

## Team Roles	

Please list the people who will be serving in each role.

- Moderator: Liz Lantz
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator): Liz Lantz
- Participant recruiting & screening: Chante Lantos-Swett
- Project point of contact: Liz Lantz
