## Hub engagement

### Sub-hub exploration
- The goal of the hub and sub-hub landing pages is group benefits in a way that helps visitors find specific benefits. Besides measuring how many exit the site entirely (exit rate), another metric to gauge retention specifically in the family and caregiver hub, is to look at what page visitors go to after viewing a sub-hub page - do they click into a specific benefit and remain in the family hub or do they click out of it.
- The main hub landing page had good retention, more than 37% of visitors clicked into a sub-hub to find more information.
- The "Survivors compensation" sub-hub had the highest retention with at least 58% of visitors to that page clicking into a child page.
- The "Health and disability" and "Education and careers" sub-hub landing pages retained at least 46% and 44% of visitors respectively.
- The other sub-hubs only have 0-1 child page making this metric less relevant.
