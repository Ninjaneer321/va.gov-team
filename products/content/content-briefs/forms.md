# VA content brief for forms

Created by the sitewide content team for teams working on digitizing VA forms. This brief will capture content variations in online form patterns and components that don't meet the use case for an experimental design or that we aren't yet ready to propose in the [experimental design process](https://design.va.gov/about/contributing-to-the-design-system/experimental-components-and-patterns).

## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward an omnichannel experience and multilingual content, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help forms teams create content that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language for content that appears in multiple forms. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

## Form content issues and examples
### Upload screens
Form teams are using several different approaches to a file upload pattern. 
VADS components and patterns:
- [File input component]([url](https://design.va.gov/components/form/file-input))
- [Ask for files pattern]([url](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/files))

**Variation 1:** Ask for files mid-flow, after questions related to those documents.
Example: [530 burial allowance]([url](https://www.figma.com/file/jpJQSCKiGegacdW4RH5uQB/Burial-530-2024-Updates-MVP?type=design&node-id=0-3489&mode=design&t=jg5rnADWwfXSZwQS-0))

**Variation 2:** Ask for all files at the end of the flow. Dynamically list files required for each user, based on their answers in the form.

**Variation 3:** Ask for all files at end of flow. List all possible files with conditional statements to help users understand which files apply to them.

**Variation 4:** Ask for files twice â€” once mid-flow after related questions, and again at the end of the flow. Let users choose when to upload. 
Example: [1010D CHAMPVA]([url](https://www.figma.com/file/HVQQBvkS9DJlNVehCwva4m/10-10d-Midpoint-Review?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=nxuvEX0dZ9CSwBQe-0))

Open questions:
- How to handle optional files
- One file per page vs multi-file upload on a single page
