# VA content brief for forms

Created by the sitewide content team for teams working on digitizing VA forms. This brief will capture content variations and experiments in online form patterns and components that don't meet the use case for an experimental design or that we aren't yet ready to propose in the [experimental design process](https://design.va.gov/about/contributing-to-the-design-system/experimental-components-and-patterns).

## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward an omnichannel experience and multilingual content, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help forms teams create content that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language for content that appears in multiple forms. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

## Form content issues and examples
### Upload screens
Issue: Form teams are using different approaches to a file upload pattern:
- Ask for documents midway through the form flow after the user answers questions related to that document. Example: Burial allowance
- Ask for all documents at the end of the form flow after all questions have been answered.
- Type 1: Dynamically ask for only docs needed for that specific user based on answers. One doc per page.
- Type 2: List conditional statements explaining which docs to upload on a multi-file upload screen. Not dynamic.
- Ask for document both directly after the related question and at the end of the flow and let users choose when to upload. Example: CHAMPVA 1010D

- VADS says to avoid asking for optional documents. Teams ask for optional documents when it can make processing faster. Example: Burial asks for DD214 for faster processing, but it's not required.
