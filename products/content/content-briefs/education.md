## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward an omnichannel experience and multilingual content, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about VA education benefits. It'll also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

## Related terminology

| Word or phrase | How we use this term | Notes | Where to find related language we use to define or describe this term in Veteran communications | Official content style guide status | Date term added/last updated |
| -------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
|Chapter 33, Chapter 35, etc. |On the program page (and sometimes other pages too), include the chapter information on first mention.</br><br>Specifically with DEA (Chapter 35), we know that Veterans use the chapter number to refer to this benefit. So, this term frequently appears in search data. Whereas we don’t see Chapter 1606 as a term that comes up in search for MGIB-SR. |When we know that Veterans or dependents identify the education benefit by the chapter number in addition to the name of the benefit, we include the chapter number for an education benefit on first mention only. |[Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/)</br><br>Example found in introduction paragraph: The Post-9/11 GI Bill (PGIB), or Chapter 33, helps you pay for school or cover expenses while you’re training for a job.
|Choose (instead of select or decide) | We use “choose” to talk about the decision about which education benefit to use. | | |
| Dependent child | We don’t use “dependent spouse.”</br><br>Use this construction if you’re referring to both spouse and child: “spouse or dependent child” (not “dependent spouse and child”) | | |
| Education benefit | Use “education benefit” rather than “education program.” This helps avoid confusion with “school programs.” | We use “program” sometimes when talking about the name of an education benefit like the Yellow Ribbon Program. But we’d then in subsequent/surrounding content say, “this education program” or “this VA program.” | | |
|Eligible | We use both "qualify” and “eligible” when referring to education benefits. | | | 
|Entitlement | This term refers to how much of a benefit you have available to use. It’s measured in months. It’s often talked about as “remaining entitlement.” And rather than talking about you “drawing down your entitlement,” we’d say, “we’ll charge your entitlement | |[National tests](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/national-tests/)</br><br> Example: Check the rates page for the benefit you’re using to find out how we’ll charge your entitlement. 
|Non-qualifying period of service | We use this term (and variations of it) to explain when a Veteran’s period of service doesn’t count toward their Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility requirements. |  | [Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/)</br><br> Example in this section: "Does VA consider some periods of service to be “non-qualifying”?" |
|Post-9/11 GI Bill (PGIB)</br><br>Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB)</br><br>Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD)</br><br>Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR)| We usually advise that an initialism can be used by itself after the first mention of the full name. But we should balance that guidance with how often this initialism is used on a single page to be sure it’s not overused. Try to find a balance between using the full name and the initialism. |PGIB is a newer initialism (as of 2024). We haven’t applied it to all existing pages yet.</br><br>In an attempt to simplify and shorten sentences and headers in the past, we sometimes used “Montgomery GI Bill” as a way to indicate we were talking about both programs (Active Duty and Selected Reserve). Instead, we should mention each separately.|[Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/)</br><br>Example found in introduction paragraph: The Post-9/11 GI Bill (PGIB), or Chapter 33, helps you pay for school or cover expenses while you’re training for a job. | not yet in style guide | |
| Qualify | We use both "qualify” and “eligible” when referring to education benefits. | | | 
| Spouse | We use “surviving spouse” if the Veteran has died. We don’t use “dependent spouse.”</br><br>Use this construction if you’re referring to both spouse and child: “spouse or dependent child” (not “dependent spouse and child”) | | |
| Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) | Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E), formerly called VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment. This program is also known as Chapter 31. | This term lives primarily in the Career hub, but there's crossover in the Education hub. In the 2024 education audit, SMEs noted that many Veterans know this term as Chapter 31. | [VR&E page](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/how-to-apply/) | Currently in the style guide in an entry for Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E), but there's no mention of Chapter 31 |  |
| Veteran vs Selected Reserve member vs service member |  | We need clarification on which term to use when we're speaking about someone who died in the line of duty |  |  |  |
| line of duty other than active |  |  |  |  |  |
| preparatory courses or "prep courses" | Preparatory courses help you prepare for admissions tests required for college or graduate school. | Use "preparatory courses" on the first mention. Prep courses is OK for any following mentions.  | [In this prep course Q&A](https://prod.cms.va.gov/resources/can-i-use-my-va-education-benefits-to-pay-for-preparatory-courses) |  |  |
| regional processing office | We have 2 regional offices that process GI Bill applications. | Lowercase regional processing office when referring to these offices generally. Capitalize when referring to a specific office, like Muskogee Regional Processing Office. | [Regional processing office addresses](https://prod.cms.va.gov/resources/can-i-use-my-va-education-benefits-to-pay-for-preparatory-courses) |  |  |

## Content-specific research findings

Here's where we add content-related notes that came out of research that should inform the messaging generally and word choice specifically. We want to make sure that the terms we use and the explanations we provide are clear to Veterans. We don't make major messaging or labeling changes based on any 1 study, but rather watch for trends over time.
