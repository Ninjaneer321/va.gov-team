## Subject line
In VA Notify, the subject line will also appear as the H1 of the email. (Need to confirm this)

Aim for a short subject lineâ€”no more than 9 words and 60 characters. (MailChimp suggestion)

If the goal of the email is to prompt the Veteran to take an action, make the subject line a CTA.
For example:
- Review your dependent information for your VA benefits

## Intro and closing
The intro paragraph should state the most important information and make it clear what the Veteran needs to do.
For example:
We encourage you to review your dependent information on VA.gov once each year. This can help you avoid debt from benefit overpayments. And if you have new dependents to add, you may be eligible for increased benefit payments. Review your dependents online now.

If there's no need for a more specific closing, use the general closing "Thank you, VA.gov"

## Links
VA Notify supports hyperlinks, but we also spell out the URL so that Veterans can be sure the link is legitimate. This is especially important when the link goes to a tool that deals with personal, health, or financial information. 

Hyperlink the CTA link text. For example, "Pay your copay bill on VA.gov" 
Follow general VA.gov guidance for link text. Include "on VA.gov" in link text, since we need to specify the destination when linking from an email.

Add the full URL after the hyperlink with the text "Or copy and paste this link into your browser: [URL]" Include "https://www." so that the URL will work correctly if a recipient is on the VA network (a Veteran who is also a VA employee).

This way, a Veteran can choose to copy and paste the URL into their browser for extra security, or they can select the hyperlink for ease of use. 
For example:
[Pay your copay bill on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)
Or copy and paste this link into your browser: https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/

Or include the URL in parentheses after the link text:
[Pay your copay bill on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)
(https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/)

## Headers
VA Notify does not support header levels below H2. 

Use H2 styling for the main headers in the email body content, to help screen reader users navigate the text.
