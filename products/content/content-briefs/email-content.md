## Intros

## Links
VA Notify supports hyperlinks. We don't always need to spell out URLs when we link to webpages from email content. But we can consider spelling out the URL when we want to reassure Veterans that a link is legitimateâ€”for example, if we're linking to a payment portal or another online tool that deals with personal or financial information. 

Always follow the general VA.gov link guidance when writing link text.

## Headers
VA Notify does not support header levels below H2.
