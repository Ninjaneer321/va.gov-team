# Content strategy roadmap

## Supporting work

The remaining content that must migrate to the modernized VA.gov is highly nuanced, aimed at a mix of audiences, and owned by a wide range of offices across VA. To successfully migrate this content, we need to first establish the following:

- **Need:** Clear content placement criteria based on audiences and content types
  - **Completed work:** We have established a [working process for content placement criteria within benefit hubs vs. R&S](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/resources-and-support-author-pilot/process.md)
  - **In-progress work:** We are working on broader content placement criteria as part of the 6102 work. This is a sitewide crew priority for 2024.
- **Need:** High-level audit and analysis of websites for consideration. [**21st Century IDEA Act: Identify public-facing websites**]
  -  *
- **Need:** Clear processes and a shared understanding that allow OCTO and our partners to effectively collaborate during migration and post-migration to maintain high-quality content over the long term.
  - **Completed:** Completed 2 pilot migrations collaborations with program offices. Applying lessons learned to refine processes for continued migration efforts. 
  - *Created 
  - Content design and plain language program development is in progress (1 recorded content training is going into Drupal KB article soon and another will follow next quarter)
- An understanding of all the content that remains to be migrated so that we can apply our criteria for prioritization
  - We are a significant way through a [broad content audit of VA, VBA, VHA, and NCA sites](https://dvagov-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/danielle_thierry_va_gov/EfbZkH1Kr8BFsXEhb09_Rx4Bhbr9ugKdUxhyh0hyZxBFVg?e=jjgReF)

### Criteria for prioritization

- **Audience and content topic:** We have a "home" for benefit and service content for Veterans and other beneficiaries. We will prioritize migrating content that fits this definition to the Drupal environment, using our content placement criteria for the Veteran benefit experience content. While auditing sites/sections, we'll also identify content for other audiences that may either be suited to migrate to the new WordPress VIP space or may need another solution (such as content for health care providers).
- **Engagement and relevancy:** We will prioritize pages and sites with a high level of engagement, based on pageviews, as well as pages and sites that . As part of this, we will prioritize pages specifically called out on the CIO's "top 1,000 urls" list. [**21st Century IDEA Act:** Action 3 - Identify top websites; **21st Century IDEA Act:** Action 4: Assess common questions and top content for deduplication and SEO]
- **Accessibility issues:** We will prioritize pages and sites with known accessibility issues.
- **Level of effort:** We will work to balance between quickly moving forward with pages that require a low level of effort to migrate and continuing to invest time in the full sections, subdomains, and tools that will require a much more significant level of effort.
- **Capacity and commitment of program offices:** We will prioritize based on current capacity of program offices to commit to partner with us on the initial migration of their content and the ongoing collaboration of maintaining that content.

### Benefits.va.gov (top 1,000 pages focus first)

Working to migrate these top 1,000 pages as well as planning for other pages within benefits.va.gov:

- benefits.va.gov/gibill/isaksonroe/verification_of_enrollment.asp
- benefits.va.gov/benefits/applying.asp
- benefits.va.gov/gibill/fgib/vettectrainingproviders.asp
- benefits.va.gov/homeloans/contact_rlc_info.asp
- benefits.va.gov/gibill/contact_us.asp
- benefits.va.gov/compensation/claims-special-burial.asp
- benefits.va.gov/insurance/valife.asp
- benefits.va.gov/insurance/valife_rates.asp
- benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_disabilityexams.asp
- benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/subsistence_allowance_rates.asp
- benefits.va.gov/compensation/types-compensation.asp
- benefits.va.gov/insurance/choose.asp
- benefits.va.gov/benefits/banking.asp <br>
~benefits.va.gov/gibill/comparison_chart.asp~ DONE <br>
- benefits.va.gov/gibill/docs/wavechart.asp
- benefits.va.gov/compensation/mailingaddresses.asp

### Full sections and subdomains associated with top 1,000 URLs initiative

These full sections and subdomains are high priority because they have:
- Benefit and service content for Veterans and other beneficiaries
- High engagement
- At least some accessibility issues

But these full sections and subdomains will take significantly more time and effort to migrate. Each presents a unique situation in terms of content (i.e. mixed audiences, content types) and VA program partner needs and perspectives. For each, we'll need to determine the following:
- If we have an existing modernized "home" for most/all of the content. And, if not, how do we help program offices ensure that content remaining in the legacy environment for now still works from a UX perspective?
- If and how we can effectively flow the content into the existing navigation structure (i.e. benefits hubs + R&S)
- How we might need to iterate on R&S taxonomy or UX to accomodate new content
- Whether a subdomain or new site section may make sense in any cases

As we migrate this content, we also need to bring each program office into the Drupal environment, provide training on both Drupal and plain language, and get shared alignment around our content strategy, content placement criteria, VA.gov content style guide, and editorial processes. This work is slow, but building a partnership and shared alignment is critical to long-term success.

High-priority full sections of va.gov include the following:

- va.gov/geriatrics
- va.gov/healthbenefits
- va.gov/opa/persona/
- va.gov/wholehealth

High-priority full sections of benefits.va.gov including the following (with an eventual need to migrate the full subdomain):

- benefits.va.gov/benefits/
- benefits.va.gov/gibill/
- benefits.va.gov/homeloans/
- benefits.va.gov/compensation/
- benefits.va.gov/insurance/
- benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/
- benefits.va.gov/persona/
- benefits.va.gov/transition/
- benefits.va.gov/atoz

Other high-priority subdomains include the following:

- publichealth.va.gov/exposures/ (eventually, will need to address the full publichealth.va.gov but exposures is top priority)
- caregiver.va.gov
- womenshealth.va.gov
- mentalhealth.va.gov
- ptsd.va.gov
- prosthetics.va.gov
- telehealth.va.gov
- vetcenter.va.gov

In addition, the Sitewide Content and IA team is handling the content portion of the My HealtheVet migration.
