//Research Plan for VA.gov website team & VBA / Benefits hub localization (Spanish) / May 2, 2019

### What product & team are you doing this research for?

VA.gov website team & VBA / Benefits hub localization (Spanish)


### Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product?  

We want to provide Spanish translations of new VA.gov benefits content and an easy, simple way to access translated content. 


**Goals of research**
To determine the best way for users to navigate to Spanish language benefits content. 
    

**Research questions**

    1. Where should we link people to localized content in a way that's visible but not disruptive? 
    2. How should we link people to localized content in a way that's visible but not disruptive? 
    3. Will people be able to navigate around/between English and Spanish content without getting lost or without inconvenience of always going to English content first (and then clicking to Spanish IF a page has a localized version)?
    4. What types of information do they typically look for in Spanish? What types of benefit information would be most helpful to have in Spanish? What format is most helpful (as web content, as downloadable PDFs, as an in-person meeting at a regional office)? 

**Method**

The first round of research can be done remotely using tools like Zoom, Appear.in or Google Hangouts.

**Guided inquiry about the following topics using mockups**

We will focus on the top 3-5 topic pages which currently get the most organic search traffic for translated content: 

benefits.va.gov/benefits/espanol/pension_veteran.asp

benefits.va.gov/benefits/espanol/homeloans_purchaseco_certificate.asp

benefits.va.gov/benefits/espanol/compensation_types.asp

benefits.va.gov/benefits/espanol/homeloans_purchaseco_eligbility.asp

benefits.va.gov/benefits/espanol/compensation_types-disability.asp

We will test navigation on and to/from mockups of Spanish translated pages for these English source pages: 

**Home loans**

How to Apply for a VA Home Loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE)<br/>
https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/how-to-apply/

Eligibility requirements for VA home loan programs<br/>
https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/

VA home loan programs for surviving spouses<br/>
https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/surviving-spouse/

**Pensions**

Veterans pension eligibility<br/>
https://www.va.gov/pension/eligibility/

VA survivors pension<br/>
https://www.va.gov/pension/survivors-pension/

How to apply for a VA Veterans pension<br/>
https://www.va.gov/pension/how-to-apply/



**What will you be testing?**

We will test navigation to and from Spanish pages for 2 benefit sections, home loans and pensions, 3 pagess in each section. 


**Participants and recruitment**

Veterans and veteran family members and caregivers who are monolingual and speak Spanish, or are bilingual and prefer to read content in Spanish.

**What is your recruitment strategy?**

* Minority Veterans of America
* American GI Forum
