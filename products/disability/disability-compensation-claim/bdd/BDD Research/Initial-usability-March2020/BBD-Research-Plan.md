<h1 id="toc_0">Research Plan Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) (Usability test 1 of 2)</h1>

<p>VSA B&amp;M1 Team, BDD, Christian Valla, February 2020</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Background</h2>

<p>This is part 1 of 2 for the BDD research process. </p>

<p>-Part 1 will be an interview about previous BDD experiences + usability testing of an Invision prototype of the BDD flow. </p>

<p>-Part 2 will be a usability test of the finished BDD flow in Staging. </p>

<p>Service members (SM) who are separating and plan to file for disability can file their claim before separation. This is done through the Veterans Affairs (VA) Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. This program allows Service members to apply for VA disability compensation benefits prior to separation. Claims must be filed between 180 to 90 days prior to separation. </p>

<p>Currently the BDD process is done through paper forms, by the SM and/or VSO. This requires a lot of management and processing time for VA. Transferring this process to a 100% online process will save VA time and resources and will also present a possibility to create a better user experience for the SM. </p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Goals</h2>

<p>To understand the current user experience, when going through a BDD process using paper forms and / or VSO.</p>

<p>How do Service Members (SM) experience this process? </p>

<p>How is the process perceived, including: the workload, the timelines/deadlines, the complexity of the process, the pain points, the need for support/info?</p>

<p>To understand if the initial online BDD prototype works for users and matches their expectations.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Method</h2>

<p>We will conduct a usability test with 8-10 active Service Members. </p>

<p>We will be conducting remote, moderated usability studies.</p>

<p>The first interview round will also include a 10-15 min section about their former BDD experiences.</p>

<p>We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.</p>

<p>We will ask Veterans to navigate to an Invision link (provided in the Zoom chat) and share their screens with us via Zoom.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Participants and Recruitment</h2>

<p>We would like to interview 8-10 participants.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In order to get 8-10 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 15 participants total, with the expectation that there will be a max of 7 no-shows.</p></li>
<li><p>For the participants Perigeon recruits:</p></li>
<li><p>All Participants must be active Service Members.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally 4 participants have started or submitted a BDD claim. </p></li>
<li><p>Ensure variation in age, gender, location, tech savviness.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants must be able to describe to the researcher what they are trying to accomplish, what they are experiencing and what they are thinking as they move through the prototype.</p></li>
<li><p>Must be able to use Zoom, use the chat function, share their screen through Zoom, and navigate an Invision prototype.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="toc_5">Research questions</h2>

<h4 id="toc_6">For the interview part about former BDD experiences</h4>

<ul>
<li>What are the current steps for submitting a BBD claim? </li>
<li>How (and when) do SM find out about the BDD process? </li>
<li>Do they understand why the BDD process is different from Original claims?</li>
<li>What is the necessary information and documentation that they need? </li>
<li>Did SM file alone or with a VSO?</li>
<li>What are the current timelines for BDD claims?</li>
<li>What percentage of SM starting a BDD claim are registering at VA.gov for the first time? </li>
<li>What was the most confusing part of the process?</li>
<li>What is the workload and time commitment for the SM?</li>
<li>What were the pain points in the process? </li>
<li>What was the most helpful part of the process?</li>
<li>Did the SM have the info and documentation necessary? </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="toc_7">For the usability test of the BDD prototype</h4>

<ul>
<li>How do users try to find BDD on VA.gov?</li>
<li>How do users expect to get to this flow / process?</li>
<li>What usability issues and pain points exist in the BDD flow?</li>
<li>Are there any confusing steps in the flow?</li>
<li>Are the steps clearly defined or self-explanatory?</li>
<li>Does the user organically move from step to step?</li>
<li>Does the user need more information to move forward?</li>
<li>Is there any confusing or ambiguous language that exists in the flow?</li>
<li>Are users missing any information in order to feel confident moving forward?</li>
<li>Are there other questions or concerns the user has while completing the BDD process?</li>
<li>What do veterans think will happen after the form is submitted?</li>
</ul>
