Creating this artifact was a request from OCTO. Specifically, they wanted to understand the submission model and experience at a high level (less technical detail than the conspiracy theory diagram.) The goal of the exercise was for the team to uncover gaps in the proposed experience's email touchpoints for a successful or partially successful submission model. Prior planning around this focused exclusively on total package failures. OCTO's main concern was the proposed release plan might create odd user experiences.
