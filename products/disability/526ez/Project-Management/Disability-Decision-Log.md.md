# Disability Benefits Decision Log

## Decision Log

This Decision Log is used to record details of important decisions made throughout the life of the project. A decision log can provide quick and easy access to specific details about decisions made in the past if questions come up afterward.

Not every decision a project makes gets recorded in the Decision Log. When to include an item in the log involves striking a balance between what is valuable to have recorded versus what is too detailed. An entry should be recorded here in the following types of scenarios:

- When a decision has a large impact on the direction/timeline/scope/cost of the project.
- When multiple alternative options are considered and we want to keep a record of why we settled on the chosen option.
- For decisions that may be confusing or not clear to all stakeholders.
- For decisions that impact the what or how we achieve a deliverable/milestone, especially when that differs to stakeholder expectations. 
- For decisions that may not seem significant but have the potential to cause issues if not understood.



| Date | Decision Title | Summary | Decision & Reasoning | Made By | Status
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|5.8.25 |Notifying IPF users |  Users with an In-Progress form won't be notified about a new form | We’re putting this on hold for now. The rationale is it’s too difficult to provide folks with the right details to make an empowered decision, and for the most part VBA can process legacy 0781/a effectively enough without having to have folks submit new 0781s. This may be potentially revisited once we’ve rolled out the 0781 at 100% to new users. | Emily Theis & David Reis | <code>Resolved</code>
