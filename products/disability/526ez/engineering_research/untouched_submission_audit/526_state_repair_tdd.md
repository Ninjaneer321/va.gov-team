# 526 State Repair work Technical Design Document

## Pupose
[In this document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/engineering_research/untouched_submission_audit/closing_the_blackhole.md) we lay out why we need this work done. This document breaks down the work into ticketable segments.


## WIP

Feedback to incorporate:

I kind of would like to know if there are any dependencies or risks that would keep us from starting this work or even finishing it? It sounds like Lighthouse is one of them, but I need that to be more specific. What exactly do we need and why (the benefits).

You also mentioned two options. I would like more details (technical approach) on these. Tell me more about what the (currently two, but as you mentioned there might be more) options are by adding the pros and cons of each option and then (eventually after you have reviewed them ) the team’s recommendation for which option we should go with. Think about scalability, dependencies, unknowns, risks, etc. Anything that might help you identify just how much work this will involve. You will eventually have to “map” this out for a high level estimate.

Our goal for this sprint will be to show this planned Epic to Emily and Sam. How we have outlined the need (problem statement) and the benefits of doing the Epic (why), and most importantly what it would take to get it done (high level requirements). We should all work on this together with you. You know it best, so your input is needed the most.

What you want to use for your discovery tool is up to you. We can create a mural board for visioning and mapping if that is easier. Google Document if that is faster, or even if you want to keep working in Github. If you need to create a diagram or chart I leave that up to you on the tool (does VA use Lucid chart?). (FYI Product people love diagrams by the way.) Once we feel comfortable with the scope of work we’ll create an Epic and the features, and tasks to go with them. It’s easier to do that when you feel more confident you have enough information to start so you don’t have to do it over again.
