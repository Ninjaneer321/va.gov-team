## **Signature Component Brief**

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to describe and align development teams and stakeholders on what will be delivered, how, and when. It is a living document which serves as the source of truth and a communication tool for keeping stakeholders informed about the progress.

## **Background**

The online 526ez form is missing the online equivalent to Section IX: Claim certification and signature. It's important to VBA that this be included in the digital form. 

Design was completed in 83556 (outdated ZenHub ticket). However, final approvals from OCTO are pending. We are proposing that we begin the engineering work, as we are not expecting significant design deviations from what we have already mocked. This issue is critical for VBA due to potential legal implications and has been awaiting engineering resources.

The task involves adding 8 pages of instructional text to inform claimants about the evidence they need to provide, fulfilling a statutory requirement for VBA to supply this information to Veterans. Without certification verifying that claimants have received this information, VSRS must return the claim. Currently, there’s no indication that this content is accessible on the online form, nor a way for Veterans to verify they’ve reviewed it.

Note: 5103 language and signature component started as one piece of work. It has since been broken up, and you can find the latest signature component work in the [5103 Equivalent Language Figma file](https://www.figma.com/design/igOOQi5BOTgQQJYA9X2G3M/526-%2F-5103-Equivalent-Language-%2F--Paper-Sync?t=Ebup2v1mov35gsan-0).

## **Problem or Opportunity**

As a Veteran, I want to sign ("certify") my form 526 digitally, as this is what I do in the paper form and I want all of the same sections of the paper form present in the digital form.

## **Proposed Solution**

See [Figma File](https://www.figma.com/design/vGmWQ20fJewxOvx3cuofpe/\(526ez\)-Signature-Component?node-id=0-1&t=hlq2oR2BH47yxICA-1)

## **In Scope**

*What will be delivered in solving this problem?*

## **Out of Scope**

*What will not be delivered at this time?*

## **Success**

Claim Certification / Signature Component:

* Given the digital form is missing Section IX: Claim certification and signature,  
* When the online form includes the Claim Certification/Signature component,  
* When Language about Box 1 is changed to have parity with the reintroduced FDC question,  
* When this work is controlled by an environment check (same environment check as [5103 Language and Claim Certification: Intro page and Supporting Evidence page \#83534](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/83534)),  
* Then this section of the paper form will be present in the digital form
