# Background
This feature addresses the need for Veterans to keep track of their claims after successful submission.

# Problem or Opportunity
1. Veterans who file disability claims on VA.gov expect to receive an immediate confirmation email after submission. In the current state, Veterans do not receive such a message, which sometimes leads to feels of uncertainty (“Did my claim go through?”)  
2. **(From submit feature)** After submitting a disability claim, Veterans expect to receive an email confirmation, as is standard with most similar online transactions. Without this, Veterans lack confidence that their claim was received. This may also lead to duplicate submissions. Veterans may also want to use this email as evidence in case they need to contact VA to move their claim forward.
3. **(From submit feature)** Veterans want to track their claim and ensure it doesn't get stuck, but they don't know how to do this. There is the Claims Status Tool, but we suspect Veterans often don't know to go there. When they do arrive there, can we improve their experience for tracking a disability claim?
4. When Veterans submit partial claims that require further evidence collection, awareness of the Claims Status Tool could help many Veterans track missing documents and complete claims in a timely manner. 
5. Veterans are interested in keeping a PDF or printed copy of their claim for their personal records. If they file again in the future, having it on hand would support their refiling. 
6. Redesign the confirmation page so the information is clear, concise, and useful to the Veteran.

# Why

This initiative is intended to create a way for Veterans to follow up on completed disability claims and feel greater confidence in VA.gov and its services. 

# Proposed Solution

Under this initiative, all Veterans filing a 526 claim via va.gov will be able to:

- Confirm that their claim was accepted at the time of submission
- Receive a confirmation email with details on their claim 
- Track the progress of their claim and incoming documentation (Claim Status Tool)
- Download a pdf of their completed claim


# In Scope

- PDF generation
- Post-submission confirmation email
- Redesign of the confirmation page
- Evaluating connection to the Claim Status Tool from the confirmation page


# Out of Scope

This initiative focuses on the confirmation page and improving how Veterans record and track their claims. Other work that might be a part of the post-submission experience does not necessarily fit in scope, but could be considered. 

For example, syncing the post-submission pages with the paper form, as noted in previous tickets and by the audit. See https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/57828

# Success 

- Confirmation email of successful filing
  
- Veterans better understand how to track their claims (CST education) 

  
# Risks

Any changes to the Claims Status Tool will have to be done in collaboration with another team.
