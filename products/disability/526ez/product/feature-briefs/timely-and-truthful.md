# Timely and Truthful Information and Tracking

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to describe and align development teams and stakeholders on what will be delivered, how, and when. It is a living document which serves as the source of truth and a communication tool for keeping stakeholders informed about the progress.

## Background
Many Veterans do not have a positive experience when submitting a claim for disability compensation. There are multiple issues detailed below that describe errors, confusion, a lack of clarity, missing information, and cognitive load that isn't conducive to the level of quality we aspire to provide for Veterans.

## Problem or Opportunity
In user research conducted in 2023, we discovered that **Veterans lack timely and truthful information about their claim.** They want a way to track their claim and ensure it doesn't get "stuck", but they don't know how to do this. Today, when Veterans want recent information about the status of their claim, some of them are calling the Contact Center to get that information. Veterans also feel that sometimes VBA makes things confusing or opaque and this leads to a level of distrust of the VBA.

## Proposed Solution
We're driven by the goal of providing Veterans timely and truthful information about their claim after the claim is submitted. We'll do this throughout the user journey via multuiple touchpoints where we know the Veteran is, leveraging UI changes, alterations to copy, and email as a means to display, update, and deliver information. As we continue to ideate, prototype, and test the solution the list below may change.

We will:
- Set Veteran expectations for what is currently happening after they Submit their claim
- Help Veterans understand exactly what the VBA is doing to submit their claim
- Provide the Veteran "honest" communication, that the claim has suceeded or failed, using the UI and email to provide up to date information
- Provide the Veteran a realistic timeline for successful submission
- Provide the Veteran accurate and basic claim details ASAP
- Notify the Veteran if there is a delay
- Send the Veteran an email once the claim is received
- Provide an email confirmation of their claim immediately after it's submitted
- Use the Claims Status Tool (CST) to view pending claims status
- Provide the Veteran a more detailed claim overview (e.g. evidence document list)
- When Veterans don't have a ClaimID, provide them a human-centered reference number
- Provide the Veteran a pdf of their full claim

## Success
We'll know we've solved the Veteran's problem when
- Veterans feel they have clear expectations of claim status
- Veterans no longer feel it's necessary to call to the Contact Center for information, thus reducing call volume for claim status to the Contact Center
- Veterans always know the current status of their claim
- Veterans can get help tracking their claim if they need it


## In Scope
- Revised "submission model" including changes to language, status types
- Creation of new emails sent at specific times in the Submission 
- Changes to UI
- Copy changes in UI and email

## Out of Scope
- Changes to CST
- Changes with how 526 and ancillary forms are processed after a sucessfull submission

## Risks & Challenges
- CST is managed by another team, and we have no ability to change the way this works today
- The EVSS to Lighthouse migration is underway. This work is dependent on the sucessfull migration to be completed.
- Bugs and issues that arise from the migration may be unexpected errors that must be resolved. We may or may not have control over the timing, design, and quality of these fixes

## Plan
All user stories are contained in this [Epic](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-experience-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/82076), we're tracking in Zenhub.
