## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to describe and align development teams and stakeholders on what will be delivered, how, and when. It is a living document which serves as the source of truth and a communication tool for keeping stakeholders informed about the progress.

## Background
Many Veterans do not have a positive experience when submitting a claim for disability compensation. There are multiple issues detailed below that describe errors, confusion, a lack of clarity, missing information, and cognitive load that isn't conducive to the level of quality we aspire to provide for Veterans.

## Problem or Opportunity
In user research conducted in 2023, we discovered that Veterans lack timely and truthful information about their claim. They want a way to track their claim and ensure it doesn't get "stuck", but they don't know how to do this. Today, when Veterans want recent information about the status of their claim, some of them are calling the Contact Center to get that information. Veterans also feel that sometimes VBA makes things confusing or opaque and this leads to a level of distrust of the VBA.

## Proposed Solution
What ideas do we have to solve the problem?
We're driven by the goal of providing Veterans timely and truthful information about their claim. We'll do this throughout the user journey via multuiple touchpoints where we know the Veteran is, leveraging UI changes, alterations to copy, and email as a means to display, update, and deliver information.

We will:
- Set Veteran expectations for what is currently happening after they Submit their claim
- Help Veterans understand exactly what the VBA is doing to submit their claim
- Provide the Veteran "honest" communication, i.e. we'll let them know if it's sucessfull or if we need more time to process the claim.
- Provide the Veteran a realistic timeline for sucessfull submission
- Provide the Veteran accurate and basic claim details ASAP
- Notify the Veteran if there is a delay
- Send the Veteran an email once the claim is received
- Provide an email confirmation of their claim immediately after it's submitted
- Use the Claims Status Tool (CST) to view pending claims status
- Provide the Veteran more detailed claim overview (e.g. evidence document list)
- Provide a human-centered reference number for Veterans without a claim ID
- Provide the Veteran a pdf of the full claim

## Success
We'll know we've solved the Veteran's problem when
- Veterans feel they have clear expectations of claim status
- Veterans no longer feel it's necessary to call to the Contact Center for information, thus reducing call volume for claim status to the Contact Center
- Veterans know the current status of their claim
- Veterans can get help if they need it


## In Scope
- Revised "submission model" including changes to language, status types
- Creation of new emails sent at specific times in the Submission 
- Changes to UI
- Copy changes in UI and email

## Out of Scope
- Changes to CST
- Changes with how 526 and ancillary forms are processed after a sucessfull submission

## Risks & Challenges
- CST is managed by another team, and we have no ability to change the way this works today
- The EVSS to Lighthouse migration is underway. This work is dependent on the sucessfull migration to be completed.
- Bugs and issues that arise from the migration may be unexpected errors that must be resolved. We may or may not have control over the timing, design, and quality of these fixes

## Plan
All user stories are contained in this Epic, we're tracking in Zenhub.
