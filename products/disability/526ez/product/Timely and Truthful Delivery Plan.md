# Timely & Truthful Information and Tracking Delivery Plan for 526ez
Through recent Veteran shadowing research and discovery, we learned that Veterans lack timely and truthful information and tracking about their claim.

Once a Veteran hits “submit,” the messaging they receive does not reflect the true status of a claim, setting false expectations for Veterans on the timeline for their claims processing. Similarly, after leaving the confirmation page, Veterans have nowhere on VA.gov to follow up on a submission until it appears in Claim Status Tool. This creates a communication gap— up to multiple days for some Veterans.

Veterans told us that they want a record that shows they completed and submitted an application– in part because they do not trust VA. However, only Veterans with successful claim submissions receive brief claim summaries and Claim IDs they can use to follow up on their claim. The Veterans most in need of help due to failure do not receive a “receipt” or usable reference number they can use to call VBA or the Contact Center.


## Goals
- Veteran has clear expectations of 526ez claim status
- Fewer calls are made to the Contact Center to check claim status
- Veterans know the status of their 526ez claim in real time

## Risks / Impediments
- This work is dependent on the /submit endpoint migration from legacy EVSS services to Lighthouse platform and must be completed. This migration also updates the 526ez online form to the 2022 version, as part of the [Toxic Exposure Delivery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/product/Toxic%20Exposure%20Delivery%20Plan.md) intiative.
- Engineering capacity to implement ideas is limited April - June 2024 for the 2022 526ez Form Rollout / Toxic Exposure delivery initiative.
 - Because of this, the delivery plan is phased by discovery, design, and then implementation milestones.

## Delivery Plan for Timely & Truthful Information and Tracking

#### Milestone: Discovery and Planning Phase
**Estimated Duration**: Sprint 29 (4/10 - 4/23/24) - Sprint 31 (5/8 - 5/21/24)      
**Actual Delivery Date**: TBD        
**Environment**: N/A    
**Building Blocks:**    
 - [X] Desk research to understand 526ez submission experience    
 - [X] High level submission mapping    
 - [X] High level technical feasibility for various solution types for all pathways to submission     

#### Milestone: Design Phase for Vet has clear expectations of claim status
**Estimated Duration**: Sprint 31 (5/8 - 5/21/24) - Sprint 33 (6/5 - 6/18/24)      
**Actual Delivery Date**: TBD       
**Environment**: N/A      
**Building Blocks:**    
 - [X] Deeper level designs for solution options     
 - [ ] Understanding of technical tradeoffs for approaches     
 - [ ] Decision on design that includes:
  - [ ] Set expectations for what is currently happening    
  - [ ] Understand what VA is doing to submit your claim     
  - [ ] Receive "honest" confirmation that claim has succeeded or failed in UI and email      

#### Milestone: Vet has clear expectations of claim status implementation
**Estimated Duration**: TBD  
**Actual Delivery Date**: TBD   
**Environment**: Staging    
**Building Blocks:**    
 - [ ] TBD
