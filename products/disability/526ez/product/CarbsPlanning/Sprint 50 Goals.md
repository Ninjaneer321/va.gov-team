## Notes
- We are not prioritizing any remediation work at this time. 
- OCTO has not prioritized the Disability apps' compliance with the Front-end deployment pipeline changes for vets-website (Shedule to be due Feb 3, 2025) - no word if there will be any impacts to us if we don't have it done by Monday.
