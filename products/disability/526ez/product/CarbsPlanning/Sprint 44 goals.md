- Release date for 1%: Tuesday Dec 3 - done

The team's main focus is to continue to deliver on 0781 Paper Sync iniative. We'll use time this sprint to do some quarterly planning to clearly define the plan for the number of resources need to support this effort. Once we have a plan we'll share with OCTO for review.

## Notes
- No need to prioritize any remediation work for the 0781 overflow issue for the upcoming sprint. Still considering tradeoffs + discussing with relevant parties in VBA
- No DataDog monitoring improvements for supporting silent failures or remediation planned this sprint. We'll do more requirement gathering and planning with OCTO first. Some may come up that we can squeeze in if necessaray.
- Disability apps compliant with the Front-end deployment pipeline changes for vets-website (due Feb 3, 2025) needs more discussion with Team TREX to plan this work together.
