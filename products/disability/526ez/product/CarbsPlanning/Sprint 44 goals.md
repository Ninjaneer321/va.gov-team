## Sumary




[Roadmap for Disability Benefits (DBEX) Team 2 (Carbs)](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1717458460532/5a74ece0ca694a9e6c85b3a1130a8c7b8dabf123?wid=0-1728398176278)


## Notes
- No need to prioritize any remediation work for the 0781 overflow issue for the upcoming sprint. Still considering tradeoffs + discussing with relevant parties in VBA
- No DataDog monitoring improvements for supporting silent failures or remediation planned this sprint. We'll do more requirement gathering and planning with OCTO first. Some may come up that we can squeeze in if necessaray.
- Disability apps compliant with the Front-end deployment pipeline changes for vets-website (due Feb 3, 2025) needs more discussion before we can plan
- OCTO had some higher priority improvements that they wanted
