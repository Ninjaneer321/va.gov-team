# How to conduct a manual UX Audit on 526EZ

## Context and Purpose
The 526EZ is a long form with multiple pathways (e.g., ancillary forms) and nested, conditional responses. Our team needs to manually test the form for UX friction points and document findings in a consistent, actionable ticket format. This will provide a high-level view of issues, help prioritize fixes, and inform a clearer UX strategy for future enhancements. 

This document is a guide to support team members in: 
- conducting UX-focused manual audits of the 526EZ form
- documenting findings

This documentation will help ensure consistency in how we evaluate the experience and support longitudinal understanding of what UX issues exist and where.

## Overview of Steps
1. Access staging
2. Review the "What to look for" Section 
3. Determine which form Steps you will be auditing
4. Audit your sections and take initial notes on a mural board
5. Create tickets for the issues you found using the *Ticket Template*
