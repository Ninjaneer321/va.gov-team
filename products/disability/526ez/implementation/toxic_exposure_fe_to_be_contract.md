# Toxic Exposure Front End/Back End Contract

Below is a collection of Toxic Exposure JSON schema and samples used to serve as a contract between the 526ez application front end and the back end.

NOTE: This is a first draft work-in-progress. More details regarding each individual section to follow, etc.

# JSON Schema & Samples

All the new toxic exposure related fields will be wrapped in a top-level JSON node called `toxicExposure`. Within this node, the following nodes (and ONLY these nodes) will be available as needed:

 - gulfWar1990
 - gulfWar1990Details
 - herbicide
 - herbicideDetails
 - otherHerbicideLocations
 - otherExposures
 - otherExposureDetails
 - specifyOtherExposures
 - toxicExposureConditions

Example:

    {
      "toxicExposure": {
          "gulfWar1990": {

# Questions/Action Items/Notes (from 4/11/24 internal review)

## Action Items
- We need to agree upon new disabilities object pertaining to exposureOrEventOrInjury and  isRelatedToToxicExposure
- Shared map of keys to locations to show human-readable values to VSRs
- What does otherHerbicideLocations dates look like?
- Backend needs to map frontend HazardExposure Enum keys to LH â€¨Frontend to send camelCased Enum values
- What does specifyOtherExposures really look like?

## Questions
- what do we send to lighthouse if these are all false? (re: `gulfWar1990`, `herbicide`)
  - Assumption: Veteran has to select "None of these locations" for us to send "NO" to LH in toxicExposure.servedInGulfWarHazardLocation
                if gw1990.noneOfThese == true
                  lh.te.gulfWarHazardService.servedInGulfWarHazardLocations = "NO"
-  Veteran has selected "None of these locations", but these were filled out in the form (left over artifact from filling out the form), none of these get into 15E
-  Do we drop the data that is not valid for the final state?

## Notes
- otherHerbicideLocations: LH validation is maxLength 5000 characters
- our "other" = LH "additional"
- The Veteran could fill out the entire Toxic Exposure section and then go all the way back to the beginning and uncheck all conditions
