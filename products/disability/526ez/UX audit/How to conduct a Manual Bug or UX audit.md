# How to conduct a Manual Bug or UX Issue Audit on 526EZ

## Context and Purpose
The 526EZ is a long form with multiple pathways (e.g., ancillary forms) and nested, conditional responses. Our team needs to manually test the form for bugs and UX issues. We then need to document findings in a consistent, actionable ticket format. This will provide a high-level view of bugs and UX issues, help prioritize fixes, and inform a clearer product and UX strategy for future enhancements. 

This document is a guide to support team members in: 
- conducting bug focused manual audits of the 526EZ form
- conducting UX-focused manual audits of the 526EZ form
- documenting findings

This documentation will help ensure consistency in how we evaluate the UX of the form and support longitudinal understanding of what bugs and UX issues exist and where.

## Overview of Steps
1. Access staging
2. Understand "Bugs vs. UX Issues" and determine what kind of audit you will be conducting.
4. Determine which (a) form Step(s) and (b) which conditional pathways you will be auditing
5. Audit your sections and make sure to track which conditional responses you are selecting as a user on the *526 Active Form Audit Map*.
6. Create tickets for the issues you found using the **Bug Ticket Template** or the **UX Issue Template**
7. Document on the **526 Active Form Audit Map** and **Audit Spreadsheet** which Steps and conditional pathways you audited 

## 1. Access Staging
In order to test, testers need to access the form in Staging.
1. Access the Staging Environment [here](https://staging.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction)
2. Click "Sign in to start your application"
3. Click the green "ID.me" button
4. Login using a username and password from [this list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/mvi-staging-users.csv) of staging users. You may encounter errors with some users. Recommended users include 230, 234, 235.
5.  On the "Recieve a code by phone" screen, just click "Continue"
6.  On the "Enther the 6 digit code" click "Continue" again. (The code should have automatically populated).

## 2. Identifying Bugs üÜö UX Issues
1. Use the following table to understand what the difference between bugs and UX issues.
    
| **Aspect**      | **Bug**                                                         | **UX Issue**                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What it is**   | A technical error where something doesn‚Äôt function as intended   | A usability or design problem that makes a task harder, slower, or confusing |
| **System status**| System is broken or fails to behave as expected                  | System works but creates friction or confusion                               |
| **Resolution**   | Solved through code fixes or engineering changes                 | Solved through UX, content, or design improvements                          |
                         
2.  Determine whether you will be conducting a Bug Audit or a UX Issue Audit. While a combined audit can surface both, it is more effective for our tracking and for your mindset to decide beforehand which type of issues you are going to focusing on as the tester. Checking for bugs requires the tester to verify whether the system functions as intended, whereas checking for UX issues requires assessing how easily a user can understand, navigate, and complete their tasks.

| **Aspect**        | **Bug Audit**                                                                 | **UX Issue Audit**                                                               |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Goal**           | Identify technical defects that prevent the system from working as intended. | Identify usability, design, or content issues that make tasks harder or confusing. |
| **Focus**          | Functionality, broken features, errors, and system failures.                 | User understanding, ease of navigation, clarity, consistency, and experience quality. |
| **Approach**       | Verify expected vs. actual behavior; often checklist-based or scripted.      | Observe task flows, evaluate against UX standards, note friction and confusion points. |
| **Outcome**        | Bug reports for developers with reproduction steps and technical details.    | UX findings or tickets for designers/product teams to improve usability and design. |
| **Mindset**        | "Does it work as specified?"                                                 | "How well does it work for the user?"                                            |
| **VA Resource**  |                                                                  | [VA Experience Standards](https://design.va.gov/about/experience-standards/)
| **Ticket Template**   | Bug Ticket Template                                         | UX Issue Ticket Template 


## 3. Determine Which Form Steps You Will Be Audting
[add instructions as a requirement to click all the conditionals. set expectation that they are only doing a couple of section at a time. go through one step with every variable possible. have detailed documentation of the exact section you are. ]
| **Form Section**      | **Subprocesses** | **Conditional Reponses** |
|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Intro, Intent to File** |None                 |
| **Step 1: Veteran Details** |‚òê Homeless Process <br>‚òê Military Service History Process | 
| **Step 2: Conditions**      |‚òê Toxic Exposure                | ‚òê Prisoner of War <br> ‚òê Additional Disability Benefits |             
| **Step 3: Mental Health**             |                 |                 |          | ‚òê          | ‚òê           | ‚òê          | ‚òê        |                 |
| **Step 4: Supporting Evidence**             |                 |                 |          | ‚òê          | ‚òê           | ‚òê          | ‚òê        |                 |
| **Step 5: Additional Information**             |                 |                 |          | ‚òê          | ‚òê           | ‚òê          | ‚òê        |                 |
| **Step 6: Review and Submit**  |                 |                 |          | ‚òê          | ‚òê           | ‚òê          | ‚òê        |                 |

## 4. Reach Out to Relevant Teams, Teammates, and Review Previously Logged Tickets
Multiple teams are involved in designing and developing the 526 form, and some may already be working on updates to the section you plan to audit. These updates might address bugs or UX issues you would otherwise identify. To avoid duplicating work, first check for existing efforts by reaching out to the appropriate Slack channels or team members. Let them know you're auditing [X section] and ask if there are any in-progress changes, known issues, or prior findings you should review.

## 5. How to Conduct a Bug Audit
When testing a section of the 526EZ form (or any structured form page), your goal is to ensure that every input, interaction, and system response works exactly as expected under all reasonable conditions. Follow the steps below:

### 1. Understand the Section's Purpose
- Read any available documentation or helper text on the page.
- Identify what this section is trying to capture or allow the user to do (e.g., enter personal info, upload documents, answer eligibility questions).

### 2. Test Every Input Type
For each field or interactive element in the section, test its default state, valid use, invalid use, and edge case.

| **Test Scenario** | **What It Is**                                                                 | **Example**                                              | **Why It Matters**                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Default State**| How the element appears and behaves before any user interaction.                | A text field is empty with a placeholder like ‚ÄúFirst name‚Äù | Ensures the element is initialized correctly and doesn‚Äôt contain unintended values.|
| **Valid Use**    | A correct, expected input or interaction that follows system requirements.       | Typing ‚ÄúJane Doe‚Äù into a name field                      | Confirms the system accepts valid inputs and allows task progression.              |
| **Invalid Use**  | Incorrect input that violates field or system rules.                            | Typing ‚Äú@!#‚Äù into a name field or leaving a required field blank | Verifies error handling and validation messaging works correctly.                 |
| **Edge Case**    | A less common, unusual, or extreme input that still may be valid or attempted.  | Typing a 50-character name, pasting text, using emojis   | Tests system limits and robustness against unexpected but possible behaviors.      |


#### Text fields (e.g., name, address)
* [ ] Type valid inputs.
* [ ] Type invalid characters (e.g., !@#$% in name fields).
* [ ] Leave the field blank and attempt to proceed.
* [ ] Copy/paste into the field (from another source).

#### Radio buttons & checkboxes
* [ ] Select each option individually.
* [ ] Try selecting multiple (if applicable).
* [ ] Deselect and reselect to test consistency.
* [ ] Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Space, Enter).

#### Dropdown menus
* [ ] Open and select each option.
* [ ] Try proceeding without selecting any option.
* [ ] Try using keyboard navigation to select an option.

#### Date Input 
* [ ] Type a date manually (valid and invalid formats).
* [ ] Leave the field blank and continue.

#### File uploads
* [ ] Upload valid file types (e.g., PDF, JPG, DOCX).
* [ ] Attempt to upload an unsupported file type.
* [ ] Try uploading a file that exceeds the size limit.
* [ ] Cancel a file upload and retry.

#### Buttons and links
* [ ] Click each button and observe system behavior.
* [ ] Check for error messages, navigation, or success messages.
* [ ] Test keyboard activation (Tab + Enter or Space).

‚òê Conditional logic
Change answers to see if the correct follow-up fields appear or disappear.

Confirm hidden fields become required only when applicable.

‚òê Error messages
Intentionally trigger errors (e.g., leave required fields blank, enter invalid input).

Confirm error messages appear in the right location and make sense.

Confirm the user is blocked from continuing until the error is resolved.

3. Test Page Behavior in Different Scenarios
‚òê Refresh and return
Refresh the page. Does data persist (if it‚Äôs supposed to)?

Leave the page and return. Is the expected state preserved?

‚òê Responsive layout
Resize the window or test on mobile emulator.

Confirm layout and elements adjust properly.

‚òê Browser testing
Test in all required browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

4. Test Accessibility Basics (if part of your responsibility)
Use only a keyboard to navigate (Tab, Enter, Esc, Space).

Make sure focus order is logical and visible.

If using tools like ANDI, Axe, or Lighthouse, check for critical accessibility errors.

5. Document Any Bugs Found
For each issue:

Write a clear title and short description.

Include steps to reproduce, actual behavior, and expected behavior.

Note the browser, OS, and environment.

Add screenshots or video when helpful.

6. Mark Completion
In the testing tracker, check off:

All inputs tested

All error states triggered

All conditional logic verified

All browser and layout checks completed
