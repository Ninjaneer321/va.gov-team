# Zero Silent Failures 
For Veterans who have submitted disability claims through the VA.gov, includes PTSD Ancillary data (0781 and 0781a), the authorization to disclose medical information(4142 supplemental data), and the process to upload that data to EVSS or Lighthouse fails.
This solution was to notify the Veteran via an email alerting to them that there was a failure on the va.gov side that requires their attention and what actions to take.

# Silent failure
Silent failures are any errors that occur within the application on any public facing VA platform (VA.gov, mobile application, VA Notify, et. al.) whereby the user (Veteran, claimant, 3rd party, etc.) interacting with your application is NOT made aware that an error has occurred.
