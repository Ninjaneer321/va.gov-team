# **High Level Overview**

VA Form 21-526EZ allows veterans to apply for disability compensation through VA.gov. The form is active in the production environment and continues to receive updates.

The Benefits Delivery at Discharge program (“BDD”) allows veterans to apply for compensation benefits 180 to 90 days before discharge and allows for an expedited adjudication process. In addition to the timeframe condition, the veteran is expected to include a Separation Health Assessment (“SHA”, commonly referred to as “SHA Part A”) as part of their claim. 

The work here is to improve the quality of Form 21-526EZ submissions by ensuring veterans are aware of the impact of the SHA on their submission and making it easier for veterans to upload the SHA.

# **Foundational Knowledge**

While the SHA document can be uploaded as part of Form 21-526EZ today, it is not necessarily obvious to the veteran on how to upload the SHA successfully.

In the Additional Evidence chapter, if the veteran qualifies for the BDD program, they are asked if they would like to upload additional documents. They are presented with two checkboxes, one which refers to the SHA Part A document but also to other documents.

If the bottom checkbox is selected, the next screen provides a file upload option, as well as a dropdown to select the type of document uploaded.

When the dropdown is selected, these options are shown.

In order to submit a SHA Part A document, the user should select the “Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ)”. For those who are not familiar with the process, it isn’t obvious that this is the correct document type for the SHA Part A. As we review the page, the alert at the top provides some guidance.

![Screenshot of separation health assessment alert](images/separation-health-assessment-alert.png)

SHA is just one type of DBQ document; there are other DBQ documents. The “Disability Benefits Questionnaire” downstream corresponds to the “L702” document type. 

Whether or not a submission is considered a “BDD” submission for LightHouse is controlled by an enum property. The LH Benefits Claim API takes in a property called "claim_process_type" that determines whether it's a BDD claim. It takes 3 values:

- STANDARD_CLAIM_PROCESS
- FDC_PROGRAM
- BDD_PROGRAM

Lighthouse does some of its [own date validation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/e7339889bf26b78f16839b9cff343590148234a2/modules/claims_api/app/controllers/concerns/claims_api/v2/disability_compensation_validation.rb#L1145-L1163), but they don't make their own "determination". It seems like it's all driven on this claim_process_type.

vets-website [translates to populate the claim_process_type here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/e7339889bf26b78f16839b9cff343590148234a2/lib/evss/disability_compensation_form/form526_to_lighthouse_transform.rb#L152-L160). That property comes from the [logic here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/e7339889bf26b78f16839b9cff343590148234a2/lib/evss/disability_compensation_form/data_translation_all_claim.rb#L805-L815) based on days until the anticipated release date.

# **Anticipated Technical Challenges**

Although creating a new flow for the SHA document does not seem terribly challenging at surface level, there are certain challenges that should be accounted for.

- **Deadline established by mandate:** This project must be delivered by early April in order to help new policies with the VBA. This means that we should try to derisk the project delivery by being conscientious of project scope and being self-critical about all of the steps required to get a project to production.
- **Meeting Baseline Levels of Submissions:** Although we want to increase form submissions for BDD-qualified veterans that include the SHA Part A document, we cannot “hard block” the veteran from submitting Form 21-526EZ and lowering our overall levels of submissions. Thus, a solution that guides the veteran through a “soft block” is advised.
- **Risks around In-Progress Forms:** In-progress Forms (“IPF”) is a continual risk for Disability Benefit Compensation (DBC) teams as they evolve Form 21-526EZ. If users are in a chapter of Form 21-526EZ that is beyond the Additional Evidence chapter, then we’ll have to consider how to encourage the user to go back and submit their SHA Part A document.
- **Risks around In-Progress Forms and Feature Flags:** There have been reported bugs where returning a user to a page that is only conditionally available due to feature flags caused negative experiences for the veteran. We should be careful to design our solution to be resilient to transitions in the feature flag, both from off-to-on and on-to-off.
- **Ongoing Changes to the Form Flow and File Uploader**: Other teams are actively making changes to both the file uploader and the overall flow of Form 21-526EZ. To account for this, Team 5 will need to collaborate with the Core Team and the Pathways Team to ensure our changes align with the overall goals of all DBC teams.

# **Proposed Solution**

By separating out the SHA workflow to its own workflow, we hypothesize that we will increase the data quality of Form 21-526EZ submissions and make it easier for veterans to take the correct action.

- **Solution Summary:** Create a set of new dedicated pages for BDD-qualified veterans to submit their SHA Part A document. Modify existing pages to account for new flow. Place behind the work behind a new  “Enforce New BDD SHA Workflow” (disability_526_new_bdd_sha_enforcement_workflow_enabled) feature flag.
- **Key Deliverables:** 
  - New page utilizing new file uploader component

One thing that was discussed was the use of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to validate if the user actually uploaded a SHA Part A document or if they mistakenly uploaded something else. Due to the hard deadline requirement, we are de-scoping this for the April deadline. More information can be found in the FAQ section down below.

# **Architecture and Design**

The existing user flow for a non-BDD user is captured by this activity diagram below.

![Non-BDD user flow diagram](images/non-bdd-flow.png)

The BDD flow alters the flow by adding an additional stage. The first stage asks if service treatment records should be uploaded. Then the second stage asks if there are other documents to be uploaded, with altered choices of Private Medical Records and Other documents (which includes SHA Part A)

![BDD user flow diagram](images/bdd-flow.png)

For our proposed solution, the pages that need to change are highlighted in green with additional notes to explain the change.

![BDD proposed changes diagram](images/proposed-bdd-changes.png)

The technical flow for uploading a document is shown in the sequence diagram below.

![Upload sequence diagram](images/upload-sequence-diagram.png)

The fastest implementation to meet our April deadline is to utilize the existing /v0/uploading_supporting_evidence endpoint along with the PUT with a hardcoded document type of L702 to /21-526EZ. This seems like a clean and sufficient solution but could lead to some rework as we begin the work to add file validation. However, it does not feel like so much rework that it would warrant starting with a different approach.

# **Technical Breakdown**

# **Out of Scope**

The following potentially follow-up milestones are out of scope. 

**Milestone 2: Demotion of BDD to Pre-Discharge or Standard if SHA is not included**

_What does this enable: Improved upfront submission classification that reduces denied claims due to insufficient evidence for higher standard process_

_Medium Confidence Anticipated Level of Effort: 1 Sprint_

**Milestone 3: Document Validation Utilizing OCR for SHA**

_**What does this enable**\_\_:_ Improved submission data quality by monitoring for potential human error

**Medium Confidence Anticipated Level of Effort**: 1 Sprint

_**Why is this out of scope**\_\_:_ The use of optical character recognition to validate that the user actually uploaded a SHA Part A document is a significant lift that could risk on-time delivery. Thus, we are treating this as a separate milestone.

**Milestone X: Establishing Participant ID, EDIPI, and BIRLS ID to ensure all applicants can start Form 21-526EZ**

_**What does this enable**\_\_:_ Improved top-of-the-funnel experience by ensuring more veterans in general are able to start Form 21-526EZ.

_**Low Confidence Anticipated Level of Effort**\_\_: 2 Sprints_

_**Why is this out of scope**\_\_:_ Further investigation needs to occur in order to scope this work. Because the first two milestones will already push the team to the April deadline, adding this work could risk on-time delivery. Thus, we are resting this as a separate milestone.

# **Glossary / Acronyms**
| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)** | Service members who are separating and plan to file for disability compensation can file their claim before separation through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program. The BDD program allows Service members to apply for VA disability compensation benefits between 180 to 90 days prior to separation. This timeframe permits VA to review Service Treatment Records (STRs), schedule needed exams and evaluate the claim before separation. BDD's goal is to deliver a decision within 30 days after separation. [Source](https://benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/benefits-delivery-discharge-program.asp) |
| **Fully Developed Claim (FDC)** | The Fully Developed Claims program allows veterans to get decisions on disability benefit claims faster by allowing the veteran to upload evidence along with their claims. This typically involves all evidence being uploaded and an additional certification that all required evidence has been uploaded, as well as a willingness to go to any VA medical exams scheduled as part of the claims process. [Source](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/evidence-needed/fully-developed-claims/) |
| **Separation Health Assessment (SHA)** | A medical assessment document completed during military service that provides clinical information for disability claims evaluation. SHA Part A is commonly referenced in the BDD process and corresponds to the DBQ (Disability Benefits Questionnaire) document type L702 in VA systems. |
| **Service Treatment Records (STRs)** | Military medical records and health documentation created during active service that support disability compensation claims. |

# **Appendix**

**Consideration with toggling feature flags**

The following scenario can lead to negative experiences occurring when working with feature flags.

1. Turn on the feature toggle for a new page
2. User proceeds up to the new page and then invokes the "finish application later" UX and leaves
3. Turn off the feature toggle for the a new page
4. User returns and then invokes the "continue where I left off" UX
5. The user's situation and navigability within the form degrades (clarified below)

There are multiple variants of this issue but a recent experiment shows this:

1. User lands on the page that should be feature-toggled off
2. Forward and back buttons both take user back to /introduction with an option to continue or start over
3. Continue loops back to step 1 here, causing an infinite loop and forcing the user to start over

**Example Sprint Planning Exercise**

Below is an example of how the tickets may get assigned to each sprint. It aims to account for dependencies between tickets, show the overall point allocation against sprints, and show where certain ceremonies occur.
