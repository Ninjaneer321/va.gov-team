# 0781 Paper Sync Initiative

## Overview
Previously, Veterans filing for PTSD and other mental health conditions were provided two separate forms to provide additional information to support the claim for these conditions.
VA Form 21-0781 Statement in Support of Claim for Services Connected for PTSD
VA Form 21-0781a Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connected for PTSD Secondary to Personal Assault (for those claiming mental health conditions related to personal assault including military sexual trauma â€” MST)
These forms were replaced with an updated VA Form 21-0781 released in March 2024 which combines and replaces the previous forms.

### Changes to the form include
**Conditions for evaluation**
Accommodates a broader set of mental health conditions beyond PTSD, including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and others.


**Unified Filing**
Combines questions across both legacy forms. Claimants no longer have to file separate forms for conditions related to combat events, and personal assault (including MST). The new form will also handle conditions stemming from other personal interactions and other event types.

**Streamlined Filing for Combat Event Related Conditions**
The new form reduces complexity with filing combat event related conditions and no longer requires the following information to file:
- Unit assignment and rank during incident
- Medals or citations received because of incident
- Details about persons killed or injured during incident

**Revised Collection of Other Supporting Information**
Other sources of information revised to:
- Separate treatment information as a dedicated separate section
- Reframe information gathering from other sources as supporting documents  


## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*


## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*

For Veterans who have been diagnosed with PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) or mentalth health disorders and want to apply for related benefits or services, the VA.gov's new online 0781 form provides all the questions related for claiming mental health conditions and in-service traumatic events need to submit a benefits claim. Unlike the previous version of the 0781 form, the new online form will be in compliance by being up to date with the most recent paper form version (_June 2024_). 

**Goal**

Create a new 0781 online form that will match the newest paper version of the PDF form. The data in the online form will used in the generation of the new (2024) 0781 PDF that will be sent to the eFolder after a successful submit. 

**MVP Team Objectives**
