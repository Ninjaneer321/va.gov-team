## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Evelyn and [NOTETAKER] is taking notes.

My colleagues and I work on VA.gov - making improvements to the site so that Veterans can submit claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. By talking to Veterans like you, we hope to better understand how we can help Veterans submit a strong claim.

Today, we're going to be looking at the experience of submitting and tracking an online disability claim. You’ll be interacting with a prototype, which is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it’s a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

What I don’t want to do is add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits. We may look at things that have caused you frustration in the past, and I want you to know up front that I can’t have an impact on your personal situation. However, I do want to hear about your frustrations with the website in case they are with things that we can improve on in the future.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

Feel free to ask any questions you may have at any point, but just know ahead of time that I may not be able to answer them until the end of the session.

If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.

Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional people listening in during this session?

-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
    
-   Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
      

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
    
Start recording.

-   I have started recording. I’d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
    

  

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s talk a bit about your experience filing for benefits w/ the VA.

When did you last complete and  submit a claim on VA.gov using the online form?
 - Do you have any claims that are still open?
    
Do you keep a record of the claims you’ve filed in the past? If so, how?   
 - Is there somewhere you go online that you trust has the most up-to-date information about your claim?
    
Have you ever had to resubmit a claim or any other information on VA.gov? What was that process like for you?


## Technology screenshare set-up - 5 minutes


## First Task: [Happy Path scenario] - 15 minutes

  
[Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/qyTtKDOTHZPGU59PAfqVhq/Submission-Experience?node-id=5626-130341&t=pNM9YNKaPaTs2lbo-1)

For our first scenario today, you will be submitting a disability claim for tinnitus. Imagine you’ve made it all the way to the end of the application on VA.gov. As a note, this imaginary event is going to take place over a number of days, so be prepared for a couple of jumps in time!
  

**[Review and submit page]**

For our purposes, imagine that you have already reviewed your information. Please go ahead and submit the application when you are ready.
  

**[Animated loading indicator]**

1.What do you think is happening on this screen?
    
2.How long would you expect to spend on this screen?

    -   What would you do if it took longer?
      
3. What do you expect will happen next?
      

**[Confirmation page]**

Take a moment to review this page before we discuss it. Do your best to think aloud as you go.

**1. What do you think is the purpose of this page?**  

    - Does this page match your expectations for what would happen next?
    
**2. Based on this information, can you tell me what you think is happening to the claim you just submitted?**

    - What does “date initiated” or “in progress” mean to you?
    
    - Did any information stand out to you as especially clear and useful?
    
    - Did any information stand out as confusing?

**3. [CST/MyVA] Is there anywhere else on VA.gov that you would expect to find information about your submissions status?**

    -  What do you think will happen next with your claim submission?
    
        - How soon would you expect to receive an email from VA?
 
**4. [Claim record] Is there anything else you would like to do on this page?**
    -   If you had to save this page, how would you do it?
    
    -   What information would you expect to see if you pressed the print button?
    
        -   Is there any information you would want included in a claim record that is missing from this page? 
        
        -   If you could download a full copy of your submission if it were available later on VA.gov? 

**5.What are you most likely to do next, now that you’ve reviewed this page?**

Thanks so much! Later I’m going to refer to this page as the “confirmation page.” There’s no pressure to keep it in your mind– just know we’ll referring back to it.

  
**[Claim initiated email]**

Now, imagine ten minutes later you check your email and this message is waiting for you in your inbox.

1. What do you think is the purpose of this email?
2. Has the status of your submission changed? How do you know?
3. What are you most likely to do or expect next, now that you’ve received this email?
    -  Are there any actions left for you to take?
     

**[Claim received email]**

Now, imagine three days have passed. You check your email and find the following message in your inbox.

1. What do you think is the purpose of this email?
    
2. Has the status of your submission changed? How do you know?
    
3. What do you think would happen if you clicked on the link to the Claim Status Tool?
    -   Would you expect to see your claim there?  
    -   How would you respond if it wasn’t there?
    
4. What are you most likely to do next, now that you’ve received this email?
    -   Are there any actions left for you to take? 

### Reflection

-  On a scale of 1 to 5, how easy was it to understand and track your claim’s submission status?   
-  On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are you that your claim is ready for review?

## Second Task: [Backup Path scenario] - 10 minutes


[Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/qyTtKDOTHZPGU59PAfqVhq/Submission-Experience?node-id=5626-129729&viewport=-2031%2C-2647%2C0.16&t=pNM9YNKaPaTs2lbo-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=5626%3A129875&show-proto-sidebar=1)

  

Thanks for your feedback. For this scenario, let’s again imagine that you submitted a new disability claim for tinnitus one week ago. As you can currently see on the screen, you have one email confirmation in your inbox from 7 days ago [show first email on prototype but without claim ID]

Take a moment to review the email you received last week, then I’ll ask you a couple of questions.

-   Based on the information you’ve received, what do you think is the status of your submission?
    

-   [If delay is mentioned] How would you feel if you didn’t receive the email when you expected it?
    

-   What are you most likely to do next?
    

-   Is there anywhere else on VA.gov that you would expect to find information about your submissions status?
    
-   [If chooses action] How would you approach getting a status update?
    

  

[Claim received email]

Later that day, you check your email and find the following message in your inbox.

-   What do you think is the purpose of this email?
    

-   What do you think is the status of your submission?
    

-   What are you most likely to do or expect next, now that you’ve received this email?
    

-   Are there any actions left for you to take?
    

### Reflection

-   On a scale of 1 to 5, how easy was it to understand and track your claim’s submission status?
    
-   On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are you that your claim is ready for review?
    

----------

## Third Task: [Evidence Failure scenario] - 10 minutes
[Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/qyTtKDOTHZPGU59PAfqVhq/Submission-Experience?node-id=5626-129729&viewport=-2031%2C-2647%2C0.16&t=pNM9YNKaPaTs2lbo-0&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=5966%3A58868&show-proto-sidebar=1)

Thanks for your feedback with the last scenario. Now, we are going to start the submission process over from the very beginning. Just like before, you submitted a new disability claim for tinnitus.

Two days ago, you submitted your claim on VA.gov and received a confirmation email, which you are currently looking at in your inbox. **You haven’t received anything since, but a new message just arrived in your inbox, let’s take a look.**

[Evidence failure email]
Take a moment to review this page before we discuss it. Do your best to think aloud as you go.

-   What do you think is the purpose of this email?
    
-   Based on this information, what do you think is happening to the claim you submitted?
    
-   What are you most likely to do next?
    

-   Walk me through how you would approach completing this task.
    
-   Do you have all the information you need to complete this task?
    
-   Are there any barriers that would make it difficult to complete the task?
    

-   Is there anywhere else on VA.gov that you would expect to find information about your submissions status?
    
-   What do you think will happen next with your claim submission?
    

-   When do you expect to hear an update from VA next?
    
-   What will you do if you receive no update from VA?
    

### Reflection on scenario

-   On a scale of 1 to 5, how easy was it to understand and track your claim’s submission status?
    
-  On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are you that your claim is fully submitted?

## Wrap-up Questions

-   If a Veteran friend asked you about the experience submitting a claim on VA.gov, what would you tell them, based on today’s session?
    

-   Was there anything hard or confusing that you would want to warn them about?
    

-   If you had a magic wand, what is one thing you would do to improve the our submission process?
    
-   We'd like to learn about ways that VA.gov grows or loses trust of Veterans. Could you tell us about a time when VA earned or lost some of your trust specifically through our website or app?
    
-   Any questions for me?
    

  

## Consent to use video clips

-   Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?
    

-   We would remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.These clips will not be shared outside of the VA.
    

-   If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
    

## Thank-You and Closing 

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
