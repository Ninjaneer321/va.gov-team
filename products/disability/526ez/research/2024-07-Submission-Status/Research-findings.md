## Research Goals

Veterans don’t have timely and truthful information about their submission after they press “submit.” For example, Veterans shared that they expected to receive a confirmation email as soon as they hit “submit,” instead of 1-2 days later. This mismatch of expectations and reality could lead to Veteran distrust and confusion that must be addressed.

-   Research Goal 1: Evaluate how effectively the submission model sets clear expectations for claim submission timeline.
    
-   Research Goal 2: Evaluate if submission touchpoints are timely and useful for Veterans.
    
-   Research Goal 3: Generate ideas for the next design milestone to improve the claim record.
    

The research study assessed the clarity of the proposed changes to submission statuses and timeline to see if Veterans have accurate expectations in the days following submission.

## Research Questions

-   Do Veterans have an accurate impression of their claim's status and the timeline to submission?
    
-   How does the timing of our communication meet Veteran’s expectations for submission updates?
    
-   How easy/difficult is it for Veterans to follow the submission process from touchpoint to touchpoint?
    
-   What information do Veterans expect to receive in a record of their claim?
    
-   How might Veterans use claim information to take action on failed submission?
    
-   How might Veteran interest in a PDF of their claim change if they had to access it after submission (not synchronously)?  
      
    

## Methodology

We conducted usability/concept testing with a high-fidelity clickable Figma prototype. In 60 minute sessions, 8 Veterans participated in three test scenarios in which they “submit” a 526ez and walk through the user experience for each submission scenario. Prototypes included: review and submit page, loading page, email communications and other current state pages.

### Design changes include:

-   Redesigned loading page
    
-   Added email touchpoint triggered when Veteran presses “submit”
    
-   New confirmation page with only one state for all submission scenarios (previously 3 states)
    
-   Content changes submission received email
    

### Scenarios tested:

1.  **Happy path scenario included:** Review and submit page, loading page, confirmation page, confirmation email, submission received email
    
2.  **Backup path scenario included:** Happy path scenario with submission received email delayed 3-4 days.
    
3.  **Evidence failure scenario included:** Confirmation page, confirmation email, evidence failure email requiring mail resubmission of a failed file.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Veterans’ mental models for claims processing do not map onto the VA electronic submission timeline.
   
Half of participants presumed that submission was a human-driven process that involved VSRs long before their submission was in the eFolder.
   
> “So he just submitted the claim and whoever will be processing
>               their claim, they need time to check. And then there will be a
>               lot of claims they have to go through. So for them it's like
>               three days to receive and start the claim.” -P2

In addition, participants expect electronic submission to happen instantaneously– not over 3 days. The loading screen may have contributed to this perception, as 6 out of 8 participants thought their application was being “uploaded” on the loading screen.
1.  

> “My submission's done, like I submitted it. I hit submit. I can imagine me and the other 20 people that might be doing this we'll say, what do you mean it's taking three days for you to receive it? You just told me you got it….It doesn't take 3 days for electrons to travel. I don't understand why the electronic system didn't just receive, validate, and say it was received. What it does in-house is different than what I see here.” -P5Blockquote


    

### Finding 2: Participants who conflated the submission and tracking timelines had mixed expectations for next steps.
    
The confirmation page and email outlined two separate timelines: Submission (3 days) and Online Tracking (7-10 days). A majority of confusion originated from the email, since only 3 participants opened the “How Can I Check the Status” accordion on the confirmation page.
    
4 of 8 participants had inaccurate expectations of when their submission would be received.  

> “Well, within 13 days you'll find something, because it takes three days to apply for it to appear online. 10 days to have a decision. So within two weeks you should hear something.” -P8
> 
> “Confusing. Up here you say 3 days. Down here you say 7-10 days…. This is electronic. Why does it take 3 days? You're saying it takes 10 days to get an update. Just leave it at 10 days, I'm fine with that. Some sticklers are anal retentive. You told me 3 then 10.” -P1

### Finding 3: Participants would likely download a full PDF of their claim for their records if it were available at a later date.
    
All participants said they would digitally save or print a copy of their confirmation page using the “print this page” button or a screenshot of the blue box.

> “Date initiated, conditions filed for, claim ID number. That's short,
> sweet, and simple.” -P1
>      “Yes, I think so. Especially the blue box, 'cause the date and then the claim ID number just in case anything the documents get lost
> and I have a reference to go to... I'll screenshot it and then I'll
> just store it in my iCloud or Google doc in the documents where I save
> usually for my stuff.” -P2

 Participants who were interested in the opportunity to download later thought it could be useful if something went wrong– but wonder where they would expect to find it on VA.gov.
    
> “Now if I want to go back, should I be able to print it out again, I'd say yes. Once I leave this page, I'm not sure if it's viewable again at a later date. -P1

 ### Finding 4: The final “received” email clearly communicated the final submission status and clarified next steps.
    
Even if participants presumed a human-controlled process or conflated timelines, they accurately understand that the “submission received” email indicated that VA has their claim and it is ready for initial review.
    
As one example, P11’s expectation for submission came from her job in the federal government. She presumed a human-controlled submission that moves faster than the 526ez– but found her expectations met in the final email.
 
>   [Loading screen] “Maybe it's transmitting to the actual VA system
> that receives the request, the files….I assume on the next screen it
> will say that it was received or no errors.”
>     
> [Confirmation page] “I'm assuming that an intake team has received this in some intake inbox.”
>     
> [Received email] “They've received my claim… That [intake team] has to hand it off in an imaginary world to an initial reviewing team
> to check that everything they need to get this to a claims person -
> the name, the social, everything on the form was accurate.”
