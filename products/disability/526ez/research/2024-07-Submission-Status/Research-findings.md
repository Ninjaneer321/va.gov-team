## Research Goals

Veterans don’t have timely and truthful information about their submission after they press “submit.” For example, Veterans shared that they expected to receive a confirmation email as soon as they hit “submit,” instead of 1-2 days later. This mismatch of expectations and reality could lead to Veteran distrust and confusion that must be addressed.

-   Research Goal 1: Evaluate how effectively the submission model sets clear expectations for claim submission timeline.
    
-   Research Goal 2: Evaluate if submission touchpoints are timely and useful for Veterans.
    
-   Research Goal 3: Generate ideas for the next design milestone to improve the claim record.
    

The research study assessed the clarity of the proposed changes to submission statuses and timeline to see if Veterans have accurate expectations in the days following submission.

## Research Questions

-   Do Veterans have an accurate impression of their claim's status and the timeline to submission?
    
-   How does the timing of our communication meet Veteran’s expectations for submission updates?
    
-   How easy/difficult is it for Veterans to follow the submission process from touchpoint to touchpoint?
    
-   What information do Veterans expect to receive in a record of their claim?
    
-   How might Veterans use claim information to take action on failed submission?
    
-   How might Veteran interest in a PDF of their claim change if they had to access it after submission (not synchronously)?  
      
    

## Methodology

We conducted usability/concept testing with a high-fidelity clickable Figma prototype. In 60 minute sessions, 8 Veterans participated in three test scenarios in which they “submit” a 526ez and walk through the user experience for each submission scenario. Prototypes included: review and submit page, loading page, email communications and other current state pages.

### Design changes include:

-   Redesigned loading page
    
-   Added email touchpoint triggered when Veteran presses “submit”
    
-   New confirmation page with only one state for all submission scenarios (previously 3 states)
    
-   Content changes submission received email
    

### Scenarios tested:

1.  **Happy path scenario included:** Review and submit page, loading page, confirmation page, confirmation email, submission received email
    
2.  **Backup path scenario included:** Happy path scenario with submission received email delayed 3-4 days.
    
3.  **Evidence failure scenario included:** Confirmation page, confirmation email, evidence failure email requiring mail resubmission of a failed file.
