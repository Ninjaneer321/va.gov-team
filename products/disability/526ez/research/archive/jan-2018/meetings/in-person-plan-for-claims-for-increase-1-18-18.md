1. Friday, 1/19: Elissa + Kristin are going to Capital Post in Alexandria, a coworking space for veterans starting their own businesses. Will have 2 - 2.5 hours to do some in-person usability tests on Claims for Increase.

2. What are options for documenting the sessions? Can remote folks participate in it?

    1. [IPEVO camera](https://www.ipevo.com/prods/Point-2-View-USB-Camera) (Melissa has one available, so does Laura) + GoToMeeting on a laptop
        1. Pro tip: put down a tape frame of the area in view of the camera

    2. [Lookback.io](https://lookback.io/) (records in the cloud)

    3. [Record on an iOS device natively in iOS 11](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-use-ios-11-built-in-screen-recording-feature/)

    4. [http://www.uxrecorder.com/](http://www.uxrecorder.com/)

    5. Melissa may know of others

3. Privacy considerations with cloud recording may be an issue

    6. We don’t need video of faces, turn it off if that’s an option

4. Loading the prototype on mobile: 

    7. The InVision mobile app - can load all your projects, more robust

    8. Using the web link, you can go forward and back with a swipe (browser back button doesn’t work). Also, you can't see the grid of all screens
    
5. Conversation guide: feel free to adapt from the [conversation guide for remote sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/jan-2018/conversation-guide.md)
