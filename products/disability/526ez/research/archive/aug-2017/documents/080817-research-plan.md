## Methods ([Method Refresh](https://methods.18f.gov/))

- Contextual Inquiry: 1-on-1 60-minute interviews with people that are critical members of the claims ecosystem. Part of this interview will be observation of them interacting with Veterans, part will be the interview
- Field User Interviews: 1-on-1 60-minute interviews with Veterans in their home or office.
- Data Analysis: collecting contact center data, survey data, existing data on how people use eBenefits

## Who We Need to Interview (Perspectives We Need)

### Continuums

_Paper, Online_

_Started and Finished Without Using a VSO, Started Using a VSO_

_VSO that Helped Someone that Started the Process in eBen, VSO that Helped Someone that Abandoned the Process even after talking to the VSO_

_Appeal, No Appeal_

_Approved, Denied_

_Less than Average Number of Days to Decision, More than Average Number of Days to Decision_

_Completed the application while still on active duty, Completed the application 15 years or more after separated_


### Field Interviews

**Profiles**

You submited your approved disability compensation claim on [eBenefits](http://www.benefits.va.gov/) prior to separation, retirement, or release from active duty or demobilization.

You submited your approved disability compensation claim in-person prior to separation, retirement, or release from active duty or demobilization.

You submited your approved disability compensation claim in-person more than 15 years after separation, retirement, or release from active duty or demobilization.

You worked with someone who represented you for your VA claim. This person helped you submit your disability compensation claim through [eBenefits](http://www.benefits.va.gov/) more than 15 years after separation, retirement, or release from active duty or demobilization.

You successfullly submitted your disability compensation claim without the help of a representative/VSO. Your claim was denied. You disagree with this decision and need to submit an appeal.

You successfully submitted your disability compensation claim. Your claim was processed and a decision was granted, denying your claim. You appealed the decision, your appeal was granted.

You successfully submitted your disability compensation claim. Your claim was processed and a decision was granted, denying your claim. You appealed the decision, your appeal was not granted.

### Contextual Interviews

For each of these, we would spend the first 10 minutes introducing the research project at a high-level. Then, we would observe the person for 20 minutes (goals -- immerse ourself in the language, problems, mental model of contact center). Afterwards, we'd do a 30 minute enthnographic interview.

(1) A Veteran Service Representative that develops claims. We would observe the VSR opening a claim for the first time and have them talk about their process.

(2) A Decision Review Officer that makes decisions about ratings. We would observe the VSR as they review the evidence and rating. Then, we'd talk about their process.

(3) Someone in a contact center that responds to questions related to claim submittions that are awaiting a decision.

(4) Someone that helps Veterans file claims. This would be part observation of the interaction between the Veteran and the person.


### What Data Do We Need

- Where people abandon the form on eBenefits
- Topics people ask about the most when calling help desk
- Correlation between appeals and when/how submitted claim
- Cause and effect around submissions when technology, interface or policy changes occurred
- Correlation between type of claim and whether it is submitted online or via VSO
