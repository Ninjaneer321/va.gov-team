## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research/during-research)*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Load https://staging.vets.gov/disability-benefits/apply/form-526-all-claims/ in your browser and log in with a test user.

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Alex and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about some changes the application for disability compensation. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

*Start recording.*

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5–10 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

- What is your experience with VA?
- Can you tell us a few sentences about your service in the military?

## First Task: Add a new disability - 15–20 minutes

Please add a couple new disabilities. You can use something from your personal experience or make something up.

### Things to watch for:

- How much trouble does the participant have entering the condition they intend to?

- Do they understand the distinction between rated and new disabilities?

- How does the contention type selection go?

- Do they get hung up on any of the language?

- Do the interstitial screens reduce friction?

  

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes

- What parts of that process could use the most improvement?
- Were there any things that you thought worked well?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
