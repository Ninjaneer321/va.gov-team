This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.
The goal of this document is:
- To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
- To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
- To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

Some caveats/notes about this doc:
- Our last participant (P2) was not able to share their screen during our session, and we weren’t able to go through the entire convo guide with them due to time constraints.
- Need to double-check this (with the recordings), but it seems like around half of our participants joined via a mobile device, and we need to dig a little deeper to see how the findings are influenced by device type.




## Initial Findings
### Finding #1 - Some users were able to intuitively interact with the Confirmation Page (i.e., the accordion/gray box) to find the info that they submitted in their Disability Benefits application
- 5/8 noticed the accordion without prompting, and they knew they could find the info they submitted if they clicked on it.
- When reviewing the Confirmation Page, three participants missed the accordion, but they knew they would be able to find the info they submitted once “the gray box” was brought to their attention. 
#### Quote(s)
> “Because I’ve seen the VA website before, I know this is the accordion. But on another website I might not have known. I would have skipped past it.” - P9

> “…A heck of a lot of veterans are older. And not as computer savvy. Whether it's plus or minus, if there was a place that said, ‘click on plus if you want to expand and click on minus if you want to reduce,’ that wouldn't be a bad thing to have at some point, so that…people understand that that's not just information.” - P1

### Finding #2 Most participants did not understand that the info on this page disappears (i.e., not retrievable) after they leave the Confirmation Page
- After leaving the Confirmation Page, 6/8 participants thought their copy of submission and details were retrievable. 
- Three users thought their copy of submission would be retrievable on MyVA.
- At least two participants (P5 and P6) thought they could edit the information they submitted. 
#### Quote(s)
> "All information can be edited even after submission." - P5

### Finding #3 - All of our participants were able to find specific pieces of information they filled out in their application within the accordion, despite its length. 
- All of our participants (8/8) were able to pinpoint our demo user’s toxic exposure info and military service dates on the Confirmation Page.
- One user (P9) was confused at first because he mistook the toxic exposure section for a place he can find his military service as well.
#### Quote(s)
> "I was thinking I would see something much more complicated. This is more user-friendly and easy to understand" (when reviewing the submission copy in the accordion) - P3

### Finding #4 - From the Confirmation Page, all of our participants were able to learn what happens next in the disability claim process
- All of our participants (8/8) were able to accurately articulate what the current status of the demo user’s application is and what is going to happen next with the application.
- Almost all of our participants were able to pinpoint this from the green box.
- A couple went to the “What to expect” section to help supplement their expectations of what is going to happen next.
  - At least one participant went to “What to expect” first.
- At least two participants articulated that they would click on the “check your status” link as one of their immediate next steps after landing on the Confirmation Page.
- Many of our participants have noted that it is most important to them to know where their application is in the system once they land on the Confirmation Page (after they hit submit in the previous page).
#### Quote(s)
> [Hovering over the green box] “I immediately saw that [my application] was submitted, and it's in process, and it gave me the time frame to expect… and how I will be notified.” - P9

### Finding #5 - From the Confirmation Page, all of our participants were able to locate how to ask the VA for help on their disability claim
- All of our participants (7/7) were able to easily locate the information on how to ask the VA for help on their disability claim.

### Finding #6 - All of our participants were able to successfully save or print their submitted information
- All of our participants (7/7) were able to successfully save their submitted information, and they all chose to do so via the print button on the Confirmation Page.
- As the “print previews” aren’t readily available to users on mobile, we had at least one participant who thought the information within the accordion would not be printed when they click on the print button.
- One desktop user (P9) made the assumption that they needed to expand the accordion for the content within the accordion to be included in the print.
- Many users intuitively understood that printing the page via the button would allow them to save a digital copy of the Confirmation Page.

### Finding #7 - Most participants were able to articulate how saving and printing a copy of their submission would be useful
- Most of our participants (5/7) were able to articulate the value of having a saved copy of their submission.
  - They believe there is a chance that their application may be lost within the VA, and having a copy of their submission would serve as a receipt that they could refer to (or use as proof) when they are communicating with the VA.
- Among the two that didn’t think it was useful to save this page:
  - P5 thought it would be useful to save a copy only if they need to ensure that they are writing the exact same thing as their submission for another application.
  - P9 didn’t think it would be useful because he believes that the VA automatically saves everything users input on the VA website.
#### Quote(s)
> “I was an electronic technician in the military… one of the things I learned is: there are always going to be glitches in the matrix, and you never know when someone says ‘gee we don’t have that,’ and [with a saved copy] I can say… ‘give me your email address, or your whatsapp, and I’ll send it to you.’” - P1

> “[When someone from the VA says] something is not received, I can say, ‘hey this is what I submitted, this is my copy.’ I just think… since [my application] was submitted electronically, at least [this saved copy of submission] is my evidence of what I submitted.” - P3

> “I’m a millennial. So I want physical and digital.” - P8
