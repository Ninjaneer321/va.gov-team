# **Conversation Guide Benefits and Claims Disability Experience Team, New VA Form 0781 Usability Testing, February 2025**

## **Moderator logistics**

### 2-3 days before the session

* Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Checklist.1958773011.html#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions)

* Review [VA Trauma Practice Guidelines (0781 team copy)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tvDgQT5M3N7Yyamf9ZKL8GYoIH22Y9hpXjnYbHyyU7g/edit)

* Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below)

* Assign and confirm notetaker(s)

* This should include a member of your team but could include others. Ask your notetaker(s) to review [guidance on taking notes](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/notetaker-guidelines). If you can’t find someone to take notes, Perigean is available to assist. [Learn how to prepare for Perigean to take notes](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-prepare-for-perigean-to-take-notes).

  * Invite observers

    * Invite your team and stakeholders to sessions. [Limit your observers](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#creating-a-safe-space-for-participants) to 3-4 per session so participants aren’t overwhelmed.

* Prepare as moderator

* Be familiar with the conversation guide, study implement(s), and prototype(s). Review [tips on moderating, guidelines for recording sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Recording-User-Research-Sessions.2050949305.html), and guidance on [participant and researcher safety and exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html).

* Confirm Zoom is recording to the cloud with transcripts on.

* Assign a timekeeper	


### Day of the session

* Use [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.

* Mute your Slack notifications.

* Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

  Starting the session

* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.

* In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked

* Check your \[screen sharing setup\] and share permissions for participants.

* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro\*

## **Introduction (10-15 min)**

* **Welcome, and thank you so much for taking the time to join us today.** My name is \[NAME\], and \[NOTETAKER NAME\] will be here to assist by taking notes. We’re here to listen and learn from your experiences. Would you like to briefly introduce yourself?

* **Today, we’ll discuss the disability compensation form,** including a new section designed to support Veterans in claiming PTSD and related mental health conditions. This session is scheduled for 90 minutes. We may not need to use the entire time, and you’ll have the option to stop at any point. 

* **We want to ensure this process is as supportive and user-friendly as possible.** We’ll be showing you some in-progress designs for this form, which we like to call a prototype. Our questions will focus on your experience filling out the form, which could involve sharing some limited details about your own mental health or traumatic experiences. 

* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits with the VA. You will be paid for the whole session, even if we end early. You have control over the pace and any content we discuss. 

* **If at any point you need a break**, want to skip a question, stop, or reschedule the session, let us know. We can also check in to see how we feel as we go.

  \[Pause\]

* **Do you have any questions so far?** 

* **Are you comfortable participating in today’s session?** 

  * \[If yes\] Sounds good. We’ll check in throughout the session in case you change your mind. Your perspective is helpful regardless of how much of the session we complete. 

    * \[If no\] Sounds good, thanks for your time today. If you decide you’d like to reschedule the session please reach out to Perigean. Either way, we appreciate your joining us.  

**A couple final logistics…** 

* **I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview.** Are you okay with one additional observer joining us for this session? 

  * If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

    * If yes: Admit observers.

Then, ask the notetaker and observer to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)

\[Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth\]

* Next, we’d like to check in and see how you’d prefer we document today’s session. We have a couple of options: 

  * **We can record the audio and video.** This would help us double-check that we’ve captured your thoughts accurately. The recordings will be deleted after the study is completed, and none of your responses will be linked directly to you.

    * **Alternatively, we can choose not to record.** In that case, we’ll take notes to reflect what we learn from you, but there will be no recordings.

* Which option would you prefer?

  *  If yes: If you end up deciding you’d prefer we not use the recordings, we’ll stop recording and delete what we’ve captured.

\[Start recording.\]

* Just to confirm on the recording: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions**

Before we look at the prototype, let’s start with a couple of warm-up questions.

* To help us get started, could you share a bit about your experience with completing a disability claim, whether online or with a paper form?

* Based on what you shared with Perigean, I see you claimed \[relevant condition\]. Is this correct?

## **Prototype Overview \+ Technology Set-Up**

Now it’s time to send you the prototype we’d like to have you review. 

* **The prototype will look like VA.gov, but certain elements like links and certain buttons don’t work like you would expect them to**. For example, this prototype does not allow for typing. Wherever you encounter a text field, give us a sense of what you would expect to respond.

* **As I mentioned, some parts of this form may ask about sensitive topics,** like your condition or a brief description of a traumatic event. You can share as much or as little as you’re comfortable with, and it’s okay to pause or skip any questions.

  * As we go through, you can use your own personal experience to complete the form.

    * Or, if you’re not comfortable sharing your personal experience, you can silently imagine how you might answer questions, and speak generally about how someone might respond.

* **Your honest feedback will help us improve this tool.** We truly value your opinions. There are no right or wrong answers here—this is about understanding your experience and how we can make this process better for everyone.

* **Whenever you can, talk out loud to share your thought process as you complete tasks.** This will help me understand your experience. I might remind you to think out loud because this can feel unnatural and be easy to forget.

* **I am going to send you a link to the prototype** in the Zoom chat–please open the page when you receive it.

[Prototype link](https://www.figma.com/proto/r3Aj9FtLFS989mlVeBsgJg/0781-Redesign?page-id=14990%3A2&node-id=16013-56374&viewport=2354%2C-895%2C0.1&t=6sbEczo7TStGBfpA-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=16013%3A56374&show-proto-sidebar=1%20)

Now, I’d like you to share your screen for the remainder of the session. Let me know if I walk you through how to screen share.

  * In order for VA to collect medical records on your behalf, they need provider information. Go ahead and select “Add a treatment provider.”

##### \[Screen 2- Add non-VA information\]

* Imagine you’d fill out contact information for your provider and press continue.

##### \[Screen 3- Review page\] 

* And here is an example of how an entry would look.

* Based on this quick flythrough, what questions do you have about the process of requesting medical records?

*Look out for:*

We’re going to slow back down our review.  

For this next task, walk me through how you would respond to questions about supporting documents. 

##### \[Screen 1- Supporting doc choice page\] 

* What is the purpose of supporting documents, based on this page?

  * How do they compare to the earlier evidence collection?

* For our purposes, select both “Lay statements from family members or roommates” and “I don’t have any supporting documents.”

  * \[Validation error\] What just happened? How would you go about fixing it? 

    * \[Once fixed\] Let’s move ahead with the lay statement selected.

##### \[Screen 2- Lay statement upload\] 

* What questions do you have about this page, if any?  
* We can assume you uploaded the document and keep moving here. 

##### \[Screen 3- Upload supporting doc\] 

* Would you expect to add anything else to this page?

##### \[Screen 4- Evidence summary\] 

* **4.1 Change evidence collection method:** Imagine you just realized that you already have copies of your medical records ready to upload – so you don’t need VA to request them for you anymore. How would you go about making this change in the form?  
* **4.2 Evidence Flow:** How did the evidence section meet or differ from your expectations?  
  * Is there any additional information or context the design could have provided to improve it?

*Look out for:*

* *Comprehension of supporting evidence types (informed decision)*  
* *Optionality, opting out of providing records*

**\[Researcher to pause– take an  informal wellness check before continuing\]**

## **0781 Opt-out (5 min)**

#### **Task 5: Remove 0781**

We’re going to move onto the final step of the disability compensation form and end today’s session by looking at the final page in the form. 

\[Review and Submit page\]

Imagine you decided that you don’t want to submit a mental health statement as part of your claim. How would you remove it?

**Post-Task Qs:**

* What do you expect would happen if you opted out?  
* On a scale of 1 to 5, how was your experience removing the form? With 1 being very difficult to 5 being very easy?

*Look out for:*

* *Comprehension of consequences of deletion*  
* *Navigation/findability of delete action (in accordion)*  
* *Experience committing destructive action*

---

## **Wrap-up Questions  (10 min)**

Thank you so much for walking us through the designs. Before we reach the end of the session, we have 10 minutes of wrap-up questions. 

* If a fellow Veteran was thinking about filing for a mental health condition, what would you tell them about the process you experienced today– whether positive or negative? 

* Were there any points where the transition between pages of the form felt abrupt or disconnected? If so, where?

* Did you feel prepared for what to expect as you moved through the pages of the form?

  * \[If yes\] What helped you feel prepared?

  * \[If no\] What were the moments that were unexpected or confusing?

* When you were filling out the form, did you understand which questions were optional and which ones were required?

  * Would you have felt comfortable skipping sections? Why or why not?

* Overall, how easy or difficult did it feel to change your mind and make adjustments to the form?

* If you had a magic wand and could change anything about the process we just went through, what would it be?

Do you have any questions for me before we end the session?

**\[If recorded\]** Before we finish, I’d like to reconfirm that you’re okay with us having recorded today’s conversation. We’ll use these recordings solely to ensure we accurately capture your feedback, and they will be securely deleted after our analysis.

## **Thank-You and Closing  (5 min)**

**We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.** Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

**Thank you once again for sharing your time and experiences with us.** Your feedback is invaluable, and we appreciate your contribution. Please take care, and have a wonderful rest of your day.

## **\[For moderators only\] Emergency Exit**

### Exit Strategies

If we need to exit for any reason on our side consider the following exit strategies. Please do not share personal information as it may create additional stress for all. 

**If you need to end the session**

- No more question**:** We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

- Blame technology**:** I am so sorry, but I just learned that the \[website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today\] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.

### **If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting**

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

### **If the participant isn't feeling well**

I'm sorry you're \[not feeling well\]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### **If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress**

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about \[topic you left off on\]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### **If the participant decides to stop**

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### Back-up Moderator Plan

In the event the moderator needs to stop moderating, we’ll have determined a backup moderator for each session from one of the other possible moderators in the session

* The initial moderator will communicate with the backup moderator via the Feedback-backchannel on Slack that they need to swap roles.

* The initial moderator will communicate with the participant that they’re going to switch with a note-taker and introduce the new moderator.

* “I’m going to switch out with my note taker, Ruben Sun, who will be moderating the remainder of this session. I’ll still be on the call, but Ruben will be leading. Did you have any questions before we switch out?”

* The initial moderator will assume note-taking responsibilities.
