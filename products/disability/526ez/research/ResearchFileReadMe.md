**HCD Research Folder Read Me** <br>
(Created: 3/11/2025, L. Dawson)

The structure of the HCD Research File is as follows: 

 - File folder names should be in "YYYY-MM-Research-Name". 
 - In the future, please do not use spaces in the folder or document name, as it causes issues with linking in Markdown.
 - Each folder should contain the following where applicable: 
	 - Research Plan
	 - Conversation Guides
	 - Topline Summary
	 - Research Findings
- Research read out videos, Findings presentations, PPTs, and other research artifacts such as video recordings, should be placed in the equivalent SharePoint folder here: https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/sites/vaabdvro/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?e=5%3A0f5e8995f1784d9aa59021cdc4776530&sharingv2=true&fromShare=true&CID=d7176fa1%2Dc0b0%2D7000%2D6dfa%2Df91eba2b481a&cidOR=SPO&FolderCTID=0x01200073ECFC0A16DB51439C06C6FDC0E92947&isAscending=true&id=%2Fsites%2Fvaabdvro%2FShared%20Documents%2FDisability%20Benefits%20Experience%2F5%20%2D%20Research%20and%20Design&sortField=LinkFilename&viewid=3fa7a9bb%2D3d4e%2D44c2%2Db93f%2D629268a08e72&noAuthRedirect=1
