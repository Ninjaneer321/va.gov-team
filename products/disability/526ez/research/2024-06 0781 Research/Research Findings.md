## Background 
VA released the new Form 21-0781 Statement in Support of Claimed Mental Health Disorder(s) Due to an In-Service Traumatic Event (s) this year, which is a combination of two previous VA forms:
- Form 0781 Statement in Support of Claim for Services Connected for PTSD, and…
- VA Form 0781a Statement in Support of Claim for Service Connected for PTSD Secondary to Personal Assault

The biggest changes to the form included:
- Expansion to include not just PTSD, but other mental health conditions linked to a traumatic in-service event
- Addition of treatment details and supporting evidence types
- Removal of many now unnecessary fields
- Addition of examples that model the required level of detail (shifting towards more brief descriptions of the trauma)

We are translating these updates to the digital 0781, which is embedded within the authenticated 526EZ. We are not currently working on a stand-alone digital version of the form.

## Research Goals and Hypotheses
Based on prior research and the discovery on the new form, we identified three research goals:
- Goal 1: Understand which placement of the new 0781 within the 526 works better, particularly as it relates to evidence.
   - H1: Veterans will be able to easily orient themselves to start and exit the 0781 with the new content on transitional pages.
   - H2: Veterans will be able to understand that there are two evidence upload sections within the form, and correctly identify what should be provided in each. 
   - H3: The new alerts and inclusion of previously uploaded documents will help the Veteran understand why they are asked for evidence twice, and prevent duplicate entries.
 
- Goal 2: Understand whether the event flow works for all Veteran experiences: reporting singular events, multiple related events, ongoing events, and so on.
   - H1: New instructions and examples will make it more clear to Veterans how they can describe their experience accurately and with an appropriate level of detail.
   - H2: Form updates will help clarify VA’s definitions while accounting for the Veteran’s mental models and guiding them to enter information needed for a successful outcome.

- Goal 3: Understand whether Veterans feel supported and heard through the claim process.
   - H1: New instructions, examples, and support alerts on every page will increase a sense of safety and provide relevant assistance as the Veteran navigates the form. 

## Research Questions

- Goal 1: Understand if the placement of the new 0781 form within the 526, particularly as it relates to evidence (which also appears in Step 3 for other conditions) aligns with the Veterans’ mental model. 
   - How well are Veterans able to orient to the ancillary form and understand when they are starting and exiting the 0781? 
      - Does the content on transitional pages into and out of the 0781 flow provide enough context for Veterans when navigating the form?
      - Does the “opt-in” approach work for Veterans with a variety of condition types? Or should we reconsider automatically routing some conditions to the 0781?
- Will Veterans be confused by having two separate evidence upload sections within the form? 
   - Does new messaging in the Step 3 evidence section showing what was already uploaded address this?
- Would Veterans prefer to upload one file at a time, or all documents together on one page? Will they be able to follow the headings that indicate which type they are uploading on each page?

- Goal 2: Understand whether the event flow works for all Veteran experiences: reporting singular events, multiple related events, ongoing events, and so on.
   - Do Veterans understand which event type(s) to choose based on the content provided? 
   - Will Veterans understand how to report singular events, multiple related events, ongoing events, and so on?
   - Are the new examples provided in the form helpful in orienting Veterans to the level of detail required, and lightening the burden of filling out this section?
   - Will the distinction between conditions and events be understandable, or should we explore adding MST as a condition (in collaboration with the contention classification team)?

- Goal 3: Understand whether Veterans feel supported and heard through the claim process.
   - Will adding support alerts to every page increase a sense of safety and provide relevant assistance as the Veteran navigates the form? Will they be distracting? 
   - Where in the form process will Veterans look for support messaging?
   - How can we align the support content with Veteran needs (e.g. desire for anonymity)?
- Are there specific aspects of the claim process where Veterans feel less heard in the process?
- Are the new instructions and examples provided in the form helpful in orienting Veterans to the level of detail required, and lightening the burden of filling out those sections?


## Methodology 

### **Design Concepts**
As we began translating the new form into a digital version, we realized there were several options for how we integrated the new content.

We decided to conducted research with two design concepts. 

- Concept A sticks with the way the form currently works, embedding the 0781 in Step 2 Conditions of the 526. 

- Concept B introduces the 0781 in Step 2, but pulls out ancillary forms (0781 and 4142) into a new Additional Forms section in Step 4.

Each participant saw just one concept. We alternated to get a mix of Veteran experiences across each concept.

### **Trauma-Informed Approach**
We partnered with Rachael Dietkus and the OCTO Trauma-Informed Community of Practice to understand and incorporate a trauma-informed approached into our research. These approaches included:

**Extra care in screening questions**
- We included a question that explicitly stated the sensitive topics that would be discussed, and the purpose behind the study
- We screened out first-time participants, so that we’d only be talking to folks who had experience with the format of OCTO studies
  
**More screening phone calls and reminders**
- We worked with Perigean to develop a script for phone call reminders that reiterated the sensitive nature of the study and offered an additional opportunity to opt out or reschedule
  
**Extra care in our conversation guide**
- We spent additional time to explain the study and provided opportunities to opt out and take breaks throughout the interview
- We made recording explicitly optional, and limited the number of observers
- While we were uncertain about scheduling long (90 minute) sessions, this ended up working well, and we were able to finish early on several interviews while not feeling rushed on others

**Backup moderators, emergency exits, and team debriefs:**
- We invited Rachael Dietkus on interviews to support with difficult situations or topics, and ensured our team always had a backup moderator and exit strategies on hand
- We planned how we would run debriefs ahead of time, and scheduled 30-minutes after every interview to give team members time to decompress from hard interviews

**Thank-you emails with resources**
- After sessions, we included some resources in Perigean’s thank-you email to all participants, including VA Mental Health Services, Chaplain Services, and MST resources

## What did we learn- Summary

### Original Hypothesis
Early on, our team aligned on a design approach that aimed to keep all sections of the 0781 together. We hypothesized that given the sensitive nature of mental health conditions, it would be beneficial to allow the Veteran to get through this content all at once, and then “close the page” on their trauma while moving on to other parts of the 526.

### What We Learned
What we found from our research about the form structure was that this created more confusion.

- Instructional Cruft, Anticipation (Foreshadowing),
and Confirmation Fatigue
   - Separating the 0781 opt-in from the rest of the 0781 introduced a transitional instruction page in Concept B.
   - This, in addition to the “add-event” prompt in the experiences list-and-loop, in addition to the initial 
0781 opt-in generated a sense of confirmation fatigue.

- Disjointed Evidence Flow
   - Separating evidence for mental health conditions from evidence for other conditions introduced perceived redundancy in the form-flow and generated anxiety regarding what evidence was included for submission.

- Orphaned 4142
   - Separating the 4142 from the 0781 required adding “foreshadowing” mentions of it, and created a sense of complexity in the form-flow.

### Where We’re Headed
Moving forward we propose a hybrid approach, where the most emotionally burdensome parts of the 0781 stay together (narrative of experiences, behavior changes, and official reports), while 0781 evidence is pulled out and placed alongside evidence for other conditions.

- Instructional Cruft, Anticipation (Foreshadowing),and Confirmation Fatigue
   - To reduce fatigue related to instruction cruft and confirmation fatigue we propose to organize screens relating to the 0718 opt-in, traumatic experiences, behaviors changes up front, alongside conditions and the additional benefits opt-in. This reduces context switching and allows us to “screen” for what subsequent types of evidence we’ll need for the rest of the claim.

- Disjointed Evidence Flow + Orphaned 4142
   - To facilitate more ease in reviewing, editing, and appending evidence in like categories we’ve consolidated evidence entry into one unified step. In doing so, we’ll also be able to embedding the 4142 in-context.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2024-06%200781%20Research/Images/Slide%2015.png)

### Concept C
Places decisional prompts screening for any additional forms (including additional disability benefits up-front). This is followed by a section housing additional forms (Step 3 instead of 4). Pieces of the 0781 in this section where applicable are as follows:
- 0781 introduction and opt-in
- Traumatic experiences
- Behavior changes

Placement of additional forms before supporting evidence, allows for screening what type of evidence we’ll need. All supporting evidence pages including the 4142 opt-in (as applicable) are consolidated in Supporting evidence (Step 4) to limit redundancy.
- Treatment details (for both 526 and 0781)
- 4142 (embedded)
- Supporting documents (for both 526 and 0781)

**Risks and challenges to explore in further testing**
- Will showing a summary of the Veteran's responses in Step 2 Conditions on the "traumatic experiences" page help make things less redundant in that section?
- How well can we get the evidence for physical conditions and mental health conditions to gel together in one section, given that there are some differences in how this information needs to be collected? Will putting all evidence sequentially in the same section be enough to eliminate a sense of redundancy?
- Does our adjusted approach — keeping the most emotionally burdensome sections of 0781 together, while splitting out evidence — hold true? Will Veterans be expecting to revisit evidence for traumatic experiences alongside evidence for other conditions, or could this come as an unwelcome surprise and lead to retraumatization?
- Does the Additional Forms concept resonate when it appears earlier in the flow? Or might this placement feel destructive of the larger 526? Are there alternative framings we could use through new copy, such as “building your queue” or other concepts?
- How will introducing the 0781 in the Additional Forms step instead of the Conditions step be received? (This would add some distance in between inputting mental health condition and seeing 0781)
- Should we keep the yes/no question for the "traumatic experiences" page or direct Veterans directly to that page? 


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

### Goal 1: Understand which placement of the new 0781 within the 526 works better, particularly as it relates to evidence. 
#### Form Placement 

##### Finding 1
Hypothesis: Veterans will be able to easily orient themselves to start and exit the 0781 with the new content on transitional pages.
Maybe true 

Both our concepts performed better than the existing form. We addressed the abruptness which was a known pain point with the way the current version starts and stops. In both concepts, Veterans have a general understanding of what's been covered retroactively. However, comprehension of the overall form flow is vague.

Starting: The intro page appears in the same sequence for both concepts, and was generally well-received. In Concept B, the Additional Forms homepage performed well; Veterans were able to understand the intent of the page and remember why those additional forms were showing up.

Ending: In Concept A, the conclusion of the 0781 is soft and ambiguous without clear distinction from the rest of the claim process. In Concept B it was less ambiguous, but participants voiced frustrations around redundancy and length.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2024-06%200781%20Research/Images/Slide%2019.png)

##### Finding 2

Hypothesis: Veterans will be able to understand that there are two evidence upload sections within the form, and correctly identify what should be provided in each. 
False 

The majority of participants were not able to clearly differentiate between evidence supporting mental health conditions and general evidence supporting their claim more broadly across both concepts.

**Concept A**
While a couple Veterans could clearly differentiate between the two evidence sections, the majority found this concept confusing, perceiving redundancy across the two sections.

**Concept B**
Participants who reviewed Concept B were able to make sense of the overall concept of "additional forms." However, once they arrived at the interior evidence-related pages of the additional forms sections they quickly got confused and were not able to understand how the pages related to the previous evidence sections of the form.

**What is evidence?**
In this context, “evidence” refers to the following: 
- Treatment records — including the types of facilities where treatment was received (private, VA, etc), and the records themselves, whether uploaded directly or a requested to be collected by VA (we tested the latter)
- 4142 Authorization to release private treatment records — permission Veterans grant VA to collect medical records from private medical facilities on the Veterans behalf
- Supporting documents, such as buddy or lay statements

0781 includes a more detailed list of types of supporting documents for mental health conditions such as diary entries, or records from counseling facilities, as well as official reports.

0781 also asks for more specifics on treatment facility type (Q13B) whereas 526 only asks if it was VA or private.

##### Finding 3
**Concept A:
Differentiating 526 and 0781 Evidence**

While a couple Veterans could clearly differentiate between the two evidence sections, the majority found this concept confusing, perceiving redundancy across the two sections. 
Along with the perceived redundancy between 526 and 0781 treatment records, participants also found the 4142 authorization and supporting document prompts to be redundant.

##### Finding 4
**Concept A:
Differentiating 526 and 0781 Evidence (cont.)**

The blue alerts generally worked well to help remind the Veteran of what was already uploaded. 
For the question about how to request medical records, one participant mentioned wanting this answer prefilled since the blue alert seemed to indicate a prior choice.

- How might we… promote a clearer understanding of what evidence types are expected in each form section?
   - Consider ways to draw more clear distinctions between form sections and highlight differences between sections that may be misconstrued.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2024-06%200781%20Research/Images/Slide%2022.png)

##### Finding 5
**Conflation of 0781 Evidence Types**

In the Concept A 0781 section, participants conflated medical records and supporting docs. Arriving at the lay statement upload page in the 0781, Veterans perceived this to be a place to upload all types of evidence. It wasn't clear to them that this page was only for uploading a lay statement. 
This was less of an issue for Concept B, because participants had already gone through medical records before arriving at this page. However, some participants made the same assumption about the supporting statements page outside of the 0781, and the dropdown reinforced the idea that this could be a place to upload many types of evidence.

- How might we… allow for a more clear understanding of what evidences types are required and how to submit them?
   - Consider providing ways to strengthen the association between evidence types and adjudication criteria.

##### Finding 6
**Concept A:
Evidence Placement**

Veterans generally expected all evidence to be provided at the same time or at least sequentially. 
Some expected the evidence to come closer to where they first entered the conditions. 

- How might we… allow for a more clear understanding of the connection between different evidence types supporting evidence and the conditions Veterans are claiming?
   - Consider providing ways to strengthen the association between evidence and supporting documentation and claimed conditions.

##### Finding 7
**Concept B:
Differentiating 526 and 0781 Evidence**
All but one participant were unable to differentiate the 0781 form evidence pages from the pages in the other evidence section in the 526, and found the pages to be redundant. Confusion related to evidence encompassed treatment records, 4142,  as well as supporting documents.

Several participants (2) expressed the desire for one unified treatment records request section with an embedded 4142 opt-in.

- How might we… increase form flow comprehension and reduce form complexity?
   - Consider ways to draw more clear distinctions between form sections and highlight differences between sections that may be misconstrued.
   - Consider embedding the 4142 into the treatment records requests in context

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2024-06%200781%20Research/Images/Slide%2025.2%20.png)

##### Finding 8
**Concept B:
Complexity and Completion Anxiety**
Only one participant managed to piece together the intent of 0781 pages in "additional forms" retroactively. However, upon realizing this was the intent of the form flow, they expressed wanting to review what was included in the previous evidence section to ensure that all the evidence intended for submission were accounted for. This feeling of completion anxiety was shared by several participants (2). 

Only one participant understood the blue alert in the supporting document page intending to remind them what evidence had previously been included. Others misunderstood it's purpose or missed it entirely.

- How might we… reduce completion anxiety?
   - Consider ways to allow claimants to more easily review, edit and append evidence submission of like categories. This could be achieved by arranging these sections in closer proximity.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2024-06%200781%20Research/Images/Slide%2026.png)

##### Finding 9
**Concept B:
Foreshadowing, Confirmation Fatigue, and Anticipatory Frustration**
3 of the 5 participants reviewing his concept had an overall feeling of confusion and frustration — stemming from the inclusion of the 0781, but, more across the 526 flow more broadly as well.  

This frustration was only amplified by an ambiguous understanding of what is required, as well as a pervading sense that the form is continually asking for confirmation while delaying information capture.

- How might we… reduce frustration and fatigue in the overall form flow?
   - Consider reviewing the form for ambiguous language such as "additional forms" and "anything else" and amend with clarifying details.
   - Consider revisiting the overall form structure to eliminate repeated instruction and transitional pages.
   - Explore alternative ways to more clearly convey the intent of multi-page list and loop form prompts.

### Goal 2: Understand whether the new event flow works for all Veteran experiences: reporting singular events, multiple related events, ongoing events, and so on.
