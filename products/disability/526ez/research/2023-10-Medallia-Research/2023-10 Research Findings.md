# Medallia Research Share Out Findings 

**Team 1 & Team 2**

## Research Goals
1. Identify and understand pain points and areas of improvement in the current user experience. 
   - Where are users getting stuck in the application submission process?
   - Is there a specific task in the application section where this is happening?
   - Do users understand the next steps if an error message occurs in their application process?

2. Evaluate how Medallia survey data can support/extend our research practice.
   - What can we expect to learn from the feedback and intercept responses? What are the limitations and strengths of the data?
   - On what occasions and how frequently should we analyze Medallia data?

## Methodology 
1. Requested data from the Contact Center
2. Narrowed down responses to one month (March 2023) = 300+ responses
3. Identified top pages:
   - Introduction = 117 responses
   - Confirmation = 73 responses
   - Reserves National Guard = 17 responses
   - Veteran Information = 17 responses
   - Military Service History = 13 responses
   - Additional Evidence = 13 responses 
4. Filtered out general responses and focused on those that offered feedback = 150 responses
5. Categorized the topic of feedback
   - Getting help = 45
   - Error messages = 42
   - Content = 26
   - Navigation = 22
   - Evidence = 15
   - Document management = 13
6. Looked further into these categories to identify patterns and findings

See the research deck for more details on our methodology, including templates other team members are welcome to adapt for their own use.

## Key Findings
1. Veterans face blockers that require external support—but sometimes find that help difficult to get. 

2. Certain error messages can lead Veterans to frustrating encounters with the Contact Center. 

3. Error messages block Veterans from filing.  

4. Veterans are finding themselves misrouted to or stuck on the Reserves National Guard (RNG) page.

5. Veterans reported evidence-related challenges throughout the application. 

See the research deck for more details on our research findings.

## Recommendations
Address blockers
   - Update error message tracker with findings in order to determine where fixes have been successful or still require attention. 
   - Investigate RNG misroutings

Support Veterans looking for help
   - Conduct SME interviews with the Contact Center in order to better understand the situations/barriers that prevent them from resolving Veteran concerns. 
   - Consider other means (chatbot, which is in beta) for Veterans to receive live help to unblock and reduce uncertainty.

Set expectations for evidence
   - Clarify how Veterans can provide more evidence in the 4142 redesign (existing language of “supporting [lay] statements or other evidence” is seemingly not clear)
   - Assess the holistic experience of evidence management in the Veteran shadowing research

Further research
   - Account for different experiences for Veterans using desktop vs. mobile when applying for benefits
   - Convert smaller observations into tickets for potential future work
   - Expand UX analytics capabilities; learn about existing tools and how to best utilize them starting with DOMO.
