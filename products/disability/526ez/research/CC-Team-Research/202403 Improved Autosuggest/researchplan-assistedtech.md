Improved autosuggest component usability testing
Draft Research Plan (updated Jul 8, 2024)
Background
The 526EZ form's Conditions page is essential for Veterans applying for disability benefits. On this page, Veterans list the new medical conditions for which they're seeking benefits.
Our improvements to this page occurred in two phases:
Initial update: We enhanced the autosuggest feature by updating the list of medical conditions it uses.
Second iteration: We redesigned the page to be more user-friendly and to provide more relevant condition suggestions.
Now that these changes are live, our next step is to conduct accessibility testing. We plan to work with Veterans who use assistive technologies, specifically screen readers and screen magnifiers, to ensure the page is fully accessible and functional for all users.
Terminology
Autosuggest component: This is a component in the VA Form 526EZ where Veterans input their medical conditions. It works as follows:
As Veterans type, it suggests matching conditions from a predefined list.
Veterans can select a condition from these suggestions.
If their condition isn't listed, Veterans can type in their own description.
This component combines the functionality of a dropdown menu (for selecting from a list) with a text input field (for custom entries), offering flexibility in how Veterans describe their medical conditions.
OCTO Priorities 
This research supports OCTO priorities to enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience and to fast-track disability claims (see #6 and #7 from OCTO 2023 priorities).
Veteran Journey 
This work fits into the “Taking care of myself” stage of the Veteran Journey, and within that stage, the “Managing primary care and chronic health issues” phase. 
Research Goals
We will evaluate the 526EZ form’s Conditions page for Veterans using assistive technologies, specifically magnification and screen reader technologies. Research goals include: 
Usability: Evaluate how easily Veterans can navigate and use the page with various assistive technologies. Test all features, particularly the autosuggest component, for compatibility with assistive devices. Confirm that Veterans can successfully enter and submit their conditions.
Clarity: Assess whether page instructions and information are clear and comprehensible when accessed through assistive technologies.
Satisfaction: Assess overall confidence and satisfaction with the page 

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
The research findings will guide further improvements to the conditions page, ensuring it meets the needs of Veterans applying for disability benefits. The insights will also help prioritize future enhancements to the page. 
Research questions

Goal 1: Evaluate the usability of the revised autosuggest component 
How effectively can assistive technology users navigate the page and submit their condition(s)?
What specific challenges do they face in this process?
How responsive and helpful do participants find the autosuggest feature when using assistive technologies?
Do participants understand and utilize both the autosuggest and free-text options?
How do they perceive and interact with these different input methods? 
Do they have a preference? 
How do participants interact with and evaluate the autosuggest results?
Is the scrolling functionality intuitive and accessible?
Are there specific types of conditions that participants struggle to find?
Can participants easily differentiate between editing an existing condition and adding a new one?

Goal 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of the explanatory content 
Do participants understand the content and terminology used in the instructions?
How much of the content do participants read? How do instructions impact how they use the page (if at all)? 
Are participants comfortable/confident with entering a condition that is not on the list? 

Goal 3: Assess overall confidence and satisfaction with the page 
How would participants rate the overall accessibility of the page?
What are the most common challenges faced by assistive technology users on this page?
How confident are participants in the accuracy and completeness of their submitted information?
What specific improvements would participants suggest to enhance usability and understanding for assistive technology users?

Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
What do you already know about this problem space?
What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.
Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

We hypothesize that Veterans using assistive technologies will successfully navigate and submit conditions on the 526EZ Conditions page. However, we anticipate that Veterans will encounter usability challenges with the autosuggest feature and may prefer free-text entry for certain types of conditions. We expect that the page's instructions will be generally understandable and that users will be able to enter their conditions without having to read the full instructions.
Methodology
We will conduct moderated usability testing with 8 Veterans who use assistive technology and are familiar with the disability benefits application process. 
Sessions will be remote Zoom sessions for approximately 45 minutes for screen magnifier users and 90 for screen reader users 
Participants will be asked to complete tasks related to entering their medical conditions on the conditions page. We also have mock scenarios as a backup in cases where the Veteran does not have conditions in mind or is uncomfortable using their actual conditions. We will have all participants also do the mock scenarios
We will screen for Veterans who have filed for disability in the past or who plan to file for disability in the future. 
We will use the live page for testing. Users will need to be logged into their accounts.
Sessions will be conducted remotely using Zoom.
