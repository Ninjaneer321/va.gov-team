## Background
As part of our work to incorporate Supplemental Claims into the online 526 disability compensation application, our team conducted user research sessions with Veterans. These sessions had two goals: concept/usability testing to evaluate design directions, and open-ended interviews to understand how Veterans think about disability claims.

This report is a companion to our [usability research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/CC-Team-Research/2025-10-Supplemental-Claim/Research%20Findings%20-%20Usability.md) (which covers the concept testing results) and focuses specifically on Veterans' mental models around disability claims. While these insights directly inform our work on the Conditions flow, we hope they'll also be valuable to other teams across the VA working on the disability benefits user experience.

## Research Goal
Explore Veterans’ mental models and language around disabilities, claims, and appeals to inform how we approach organizing the conditions flow.

## Research Questions
- How are conditions and their various statuses (particularly in relation to the VA) perceived?
- How do Veterans think about conditions that have been granted v. those that have been denied?
   - What about conditions that were granted at 0%?
- How do Veterans think about their conditions in terms of causality and relation to military service (e.g. service connection, presumption)
   - Do Veterans think of secondary conditions differently from conditions that are directly service-connected or aggravated?
- Is there a perceived order in which claims should be filed, and if yes, what is that order and what are its origins?
- How do Veterans think about challenging a VA decision? What words do they use?

### Goal: Determine which of the design directions best meets user needs when filing a Supplemental Claim within the online 526, without negatively impacting the user experience of filing a standard disability claim.

## Methodology 

### Participants

### Testing structure


### Data collection
- 

### Location and device
Sessions were conducted remotely, over Zoom. Participants joined from a computer, tablet, or smartphone.

- [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/P6IUm8gN00H3Yi1XzN80fj/-526ez--Condition-information-entry?page-id=6174%3A18589&node-id=6524-47192&viewport=653%2C-7741%2C0.75&t=UWlAy6DgYnnYEKOL-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=6524%3A47192&show-proto-sidebar=1)

>[!NOTE]
>Participants 1-5 consistently struggled with differentiating between a Supplemental Claim and a Claim for Increase. Because it was a major goal of this study to understand how Veterans perceive the two claim types, we worked with our VA partners to tweak the prototypes with the intent to further clarify the intent of these claims. These updates necessitated minor changes to the conversation guide. The V2 conversation guide was used for all sessions after participant 5, and reflected language changes made to the Supplemental Claim info screen in prototype Apple, language changes made to the previously denied conditions and rated condition follow-up screens in prototype Banana, and the removal of a redundant Supplemental Claim information screen in prototype Banana.

### Research participants 
#### Recruitment criteria
We, in partnership with Perigean, recruited Veterans across the following categories:
  - Have previously filed a disability claim of any type within the last 15 years AND never appealed a disability decision
  - Have previously filed a disability claim of any type within the last 15 years AND an appeal to a disability decision
  - Have never filed a disability claim
  - Have experience helping other Veterans file disability claims (2) (haven’t necessarily filed a claim themselves)

In terms of Veteran backgrounds, we aimed for a balanced group across demographics. Because we’ll use Figma wireframes for testing, we did not recruit for AT users. We also aimed to over-recruit for groups that were under-represented in our most recent study (see “2025-06 New/Increase Conditions” tab in the VA Recruitment Checker for Equality; this study’s equality metrics are tracked in the “2025-10 Supplemental Claims in 526” tab of the same spreadsheet).

#### Underserved groups we haven’t talked to

Additionally, because we tested in Figma we were not able to test with AT users.
