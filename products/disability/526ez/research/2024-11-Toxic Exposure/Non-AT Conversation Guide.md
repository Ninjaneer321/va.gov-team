## **Introduction \- 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today\!  My name is \[FACILITATOR\] and \[NOTETAKER\] is taking notes. I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you. 

* **Today, we will be looking at new questions added to the disability compensation form on VA.gov.** This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to respect your time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic so we finish promptly. 

* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

* **​​In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.

* **We may look at things that have caused you frustration in the past, and I want you to know up front that I can’t have an impact on your personal situation.** However, I do want to hear about your frustrations with the website in case they are with things that we can improve on in the future.

* **That was a lot of information.** Are you comfortable proceeding with the agenda I’ve proposed for today’s session? 

* **Perigean did ask for your consent to allow some other folks to listen in.** Are you okay with a couple of additional people listening in during this session?  
* *If no***:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

* *If yes:* Admit observers.

* Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

* **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

  * *If yes:* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*

* I have started recording. I’d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions \- 5 minutes**

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.

* Have you filed for disability compensation in the past? If so, how did you file the claim? (online, on paper, with VSO, etc)  
  * Have you been granted compensation for any of the conditions you filed for?  
* Are you considering filing any new claims in the future? \[Use this to prompt the TE opt-in screen if needed\]  
* Are you familiar with the Pact Act? If so, where did you learn about it?   
  * Do you think you are eligible? Why or why not?  
* The questions we are looking at today are related to your military service history. If you’re comfortable sharing, it would be helpful to know when you served, and in which branch. 

## **Technology screenshare set-up \- 5 minutes**

Thanks for sharing your experience with me. We’re going to shift gears and move into looking at VA.gov. None of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.

I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please open the page. 

Now, I am going to send you a username and a password so we can look at the designs from your device.

Next, I’d like you to share your screen for the remainder of the session. If you need help figuring out how to share your screen I am happy to troubleshoot\!

## **First Task: \[Concept Test- Review and Submit alert\] \- 10 minutes**

That was a lot to get through, thanks for your patience. Now we are ready to begin our first task. We are starting today’s session at the end of the disability compensation form, rather than the beginning. This screen is at the very end of the form in step 5 out of 5\. 

We filled out the form with fake data– none of the information listed is yours and will not impact your benefits in any way. 

Task: Review the screen and let me know when you are ready to submit your claim. 

Do not navigate away from this screen, but tell me verbally if you would like to go somewhere else.

**Post-Task Questions**

* Is there anything else that you’d like to do before submitting your claim?  
* Did any specific information stand out to you as you reviewed the page?  
* In your own words, what do you think the text under the heading “we updated our online form” is communicating? \[Heading level 2, middle of the page\]   
  * What does the phrase “toxic exposure” mean to you?  
* Would you expect to answer the new questions before submitting?  
* If you were to click on the link, where would you expect it to take you? 

*Look out for: Misunderstanding or missing the alert content, understanding of eligibility, rationale for opting in or out*  
---

## **Second Task: \[Navigate from alert to TE questions\] \- 5 minutes**

Task: Navigate the new questions that were added to the form.

**Post-Task Questions**

* On a scale of 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete this task, with 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy?  
* Did you have any trouble finding the link to access this page? If so, please describe the issue.  
* Where did the link take you? Is this where you expected to go?


  
*Look out for: Issues finding the link, confusion around location in the form*  
---

## **Third Task: \[Opt in to Toxic Exposure\] \- 5 minutes**

Thanks for all of your feedback\! 

Imagine that you are a Veteran filing for disability compensation for new conditions. As a reminder, we’ve pre-filled the form with fake data, so the conditions listed on the page are not yours. 

Task: Complete this screen as if one of your conditions resulted from exposure to Agent Orange during your service.

**Post-task questions**

* On a scale of 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to complete this task, with 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy?  
* Is any information confusing or missing from this page?  
* \[If viewed TE hint text or new tab\] Was the additional information about toxic exposure helpful? 

*Look out for: Did participant view toxic exposure hint or have issues with the new tab? Any confusion/questions about toxic exposure eligibility?*  
---

## **Fourth Task: \[Complete location and date pages\] \- 15 minutes**

*Background for facilitator: Screens in the toxic exposure flow cycle four times– once for each set of location/dates or hazard.*   
*The participant may skip certain questions based on their military service dates. Participants must fill out at least one location screen to complete the exercise.*   
*The facilitator uses military service information provided by the participant during warm-up questions to prompt them if they get stuck, or use the mock scenario below.* 

For the rest of this session, you may use your military service to guide your answers to the questions. Are you comfortable doing so, or would you prefer a mock scenario?

Scenario, if selected:  Imagine you are filing for disability compensation. You served in multiple locations during the Gulf War and were exposed to various hazards during your service. 

Task: Complete the questions related to toxic exposure in the form. 

Please talk out loud as you go; I may pause you to ask questions at various points.

### **If the participant can't screen share after troubleshooting**

I really appreciate your patience through this. I'm sure you know, it can be really frustrating when technology is not our friend. Since we're not able to set up screen share, we're going to end the session now. You're still going to be compensated for the full session. Thanks again for joining us and we'll hopefully see you back here again for another study.

### **If the participant isn't feeling well**

I'm sorry you're \[not feeling well\]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.  
If they choose to continue...  
Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### **If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress**

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?  
If they choose to take a break and come back...  
Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about \[topic you left off on\]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### **If the participant decides to stop**

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.  
If they seem distressed...  
Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### 

### **If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't**

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...  
Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
