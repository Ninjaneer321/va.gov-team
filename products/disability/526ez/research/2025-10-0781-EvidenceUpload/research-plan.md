# Research Plan for 0781 Upload Documents, Disability Benefits, Pathways Team, September 2025

## Background üèóÔ∏è

At the present, all Veterans upload their documents as supporting evidence of their claim in one step at the very end of VA form 21-526 EZ, the application Veterans use to apply for disability compensation benefits. Veterans who opt into form 0781, which supports claims for mental health conditions, do not currently have a specific section that walks them through the process of uploading documents to support those conditions. 

We are enabling Veterans to submit evidence to support their mental health conditions within the 526\. We are using existing design patterns for uploading files, so this research will mainly focus on content comprehension and navigation. 

*What problem is your product trying to solve?*

Although opting into the 0781 form is optional, once the Veteran does so, they need to provide evidence to support their stated mental health conditions. If the Veteran doesn‚Äôt provide the correct evidence, it can delay adjudication or result in their claim being denied. Additionally if the Veteran doesn‚Äôt provide enough of the right kind of evidence, the VBA will not be equipped to follow up on these items, leading to their claim being denied. 

ut the problem of if people submit an 0781 without evidence, it can delay adjudication or even result in their claim being denied.

Worth mentioning, that the bar to obtain this evidence for online submissions is higher than usual.

Typically, VBMS would have the option to develop claims for evidence further. In this case, because we're not ticking off boxes for individual items, VBA will not be equipped to follow up on these items.

 

### Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)

Authenticated


### What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

Veterans are currently uploading documents in the last step of the form. This section is meant to capture all documents for all types of conditions, regardless of whether or not they have opted into the 0781\. Our design proposal uses existing design patterns to create additional pages to support the submission of appropriate evidence to support mental health conditions.

- [Help Veterans provide evidence to support their mental health statement (0781) and all other conditions in a single section of the Disability form (526) \#114046](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/114046)

### [**OCTO-DE Priorities**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md)

**Objective 1: VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.**

* Key Result 1: Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.  
* Key Result 3: 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

## Research Goals ü•Ö  


* Goal 1: Gather feedback on the **instructional content** on each page.  
* Goal 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of the **formatting and visual hierarch**y of the information presented.  
* Goal 3: Evaluate whether users are able **navigate through** the document upload sections.   
* Goal 4: Understand **how users think through uploading evidence** in support of their condition(s).

 

***Outcome***

This research will give us a better understanding of claimants‚Äô understanding and experience of uploading documents in support of their claim. We expect to find insights on the usability, language clarity, and navigability of the upload flows. These insights will inform the next iteration of  the evidence section in our online form to ensure claimants can upload the appropriate documents related to their mental health conditions separately from their other conditions. We are also hoping to understand how claimants think about uploading documents generally, as inspiration for a future evidence upload redesign project.

### Research questions

**Goal 1: Gather feedback on the instructional content on each page.**

* How do users react to the amount of information on each page?  
* What sections of the evidence orientation/document choice page do users find the most valuable?  
* What sections of the evidence orientation/document choice do users have questions about?  
* Do people understand the content?   
* Do people understand that they need to upload mental health related documents first and then other documents afterwards? 

**Goal 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of the formatting and visual hierarchy of the information presented**

* Can a user easily find and interact with the interactive elements (additional info, accordion)? Are they interested in pursuing information contained in these elements?  
* Can a user find specific pieces of information within the interactive elements (document type)?  
* Is the information provided enough to support users‚Äô accurate decision-making?

**Goal 3: Evaluate whether users are able navigate through the document upload sections.** 

* From the initial Evidence Orientation page, are users clear on the next steps?  
* Can users successfully make it through the upload section, uploading the right documents in the right sections?  
* Is the process of making changes to user inputs intuitive?

**Goal 4: Understand how users think through uploading evidence in support of their condition(s).** 

* How do users categorize their documents?   
* How do users think about their documents in respect to their claim?

**Hypotheses**

* Most participants will be able to understand that there are three steps to the supporting evidence upload step.  
* Most participants will find it helpful that there is specific guidance for uploading documents to support mental health conditions  
* Most participants will find the summary screens helpful for reflecting on and confirming their upload choices  
* Most participants will understand the document descriptions, and will find the external links to be supportive in their understanding

## **Methodology üõ†Ô∏è**

We propose semi-structured user interviews and observations for this study. This research will be moderated remotely on Zoom to support screen sharing. 

The goal of these interviews is to understand the underlying meaning behind why participants hold certain views and have particular needs. Although the design is high-fidelity and fairly refined, we are proposing a discovery-leaning methodology so that we can gather stories that users create about the content that they are seeing. We are choosing not to do an unmoderated usability study because the process of uploading condition-appropriate documentation is highly specific to the individual; setting up a study like this would take an immense amount of preparation that does not feel appropriate at this time. However, as part of this semi-structured approach, the researcher may ask participants to complete certain small tasks. These tasks are to serve as a manifestation of a user‚Äôs understanding of the content and structure of the design.
