## Overview
We are monitoring UXreviewing Medallia data from July 1-August 9 2024 so we can establish a baseline for what to expect from the survey data before we launch Toxic Exposure. This will help us distinguish ongoing UX challenges from those caused by the rollout.

## Summary of responses

### Feedback survey
Between [Dates], the Medallia Feedback survey received **[#] responses.** 

User feedback was most concentrated on the first and last pages of the form.
|Rank|July-Aug 9| Next| Future|
|--|--|--|--|
|1| Introduction (116/25%)|||
|2| Confirmation (76/16%)|||
|3| Start (64/14%)|||
|4| Review & Submit (19/4%)| ||

### Intercept survey
Between July 1 and August 9, 2024, the Medallia Intercept survey received **85 responses.** 

User feedback was most concentrated at the very beginning of the form, despite the fact that it is intended to more evenly  “intercept” 5% of VA.gov users who have had a 20-second or more extended session. This is a known problem and already ticketed (#88712), but this data pull reinforces our hunch. 

|Rank|Top Intercept Pages|# of responses| % of total responses|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|Introduction| 42 | 49% |
|2| Start| 22 | 26%|
|3| Veteran Information | 7 | 8% |

## Top Themes
I coded all qualitative user feedback using the codes developed for past Medallia review and added new ones as needed. Most common specific feedback themes included [INSERT CODES HERE].  See Appendix for full list of codes/themes and definitions.

### Coding - Themes across survey responses
I coded all qualitative user feedback using the codes developed in our last Medallia review (March 2023 data) and added new ones as needed. Most common specific feedback themes included usability issues, questions about filing for the Pact Act, problems with error blockers, and navigation. 

|Code|Feedback count| Intercept count|Definition|
|--|--|--|--|
|Usability|  |--|Responses that describe specific usability issues not encompassed by other tags. Examples include character limits, inability to update prefill, not being able to continue, etc.|
|PACT| |--| Responses that reference Toxic Exposure or the PACT Act|
|Error| |--| Responses that describe an error message they came across in the form |
|Navigation | || Responses that describe moving from one part of the application to another and wayfinding |
|Getting help| || Responses that describe seeking help from the hotline, VSOs, professionals, or other sources|
|Evidence/evidence upload| ||Responses that describe evidence or medical records, uploading or downloading|
|Pain point| ||Responses that express distress or frustration, but don’t fall into another tag |
|Submission|  |--| Responses that describe submitting their form and/or the confirmation page|
|Intent to File| | -- |Responses that reference Intent to File or upcoming ITF deadlines|
| Bright spot|  || Positive feedback or something that’s working well|
|General| || Responses that included non-specific qualitative information, such as "filing"|
