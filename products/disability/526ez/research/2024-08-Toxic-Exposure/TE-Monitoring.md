# Monitoring Toxic Exposure Release

**Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTO-DE), 526EZ, DBEX 1**

**Dates:** August-September 2024

**Product/UX:** Jared Pace [Jared.pace@agile6.com] & Evelyn Hilbrich Davis [evelyn@cityfriends.tech] 

## Background
We are monitoring the 1.0 and 1.1 release of the new Toxic Exposure feature for the 526ez, starting at 5% in late August 2024. By tracking interactions and gathering feedback, we will identify any issues with TE early so we can make data-driven improvements.
- This report will document GA4, Data Dog, and Medallia survey data over the course of the release.
- We are considering adding Contact Center as a data source to capture the feedback of Veterans calling for help on TE.
- Relevant tickets: [(#90466)](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-benefits-experience-team-1-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/90466) and [(#88714)](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-benefits-experience-team-1-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/88714)

**Note:** We will be responsive to the release, updating our monitoring approach as we learn more/better! 

**8/26 UX-Product sync:** We recognized that Medallia data will not impact decision-making on whether or not we will proceed with the roll-out. Therefore, we are moving Medallia data review to the end of each phase of the rollout in order to capture a hollistic picture and saving a lot of work. 

## Scope of this report
This reporting will seek to keep all stakeholders informed of the rollout's progress. Beyond this documentation, DBEX Team 1 will monitor the TE release daily to identify bugs/challenges and make informed decisions about pacing the rollout. Any resulting concerns will be immediately escalated to OCTO/VBA via slack.  

## Schedule of reporting
Success metrics will be updated in this document at the end of each rollout percentage, starting with 5%. At the end of both the 1.0 and 1.1 release, we will review Medallia data in order to add more detail to the user experience of the feature.

## Summary of Medallia survey data (Evaluated at completion of 1.0 and 1.1 rollouts)
Before launch, we reviewed Medallia survey data **from July 1-August 9** to help set a baseline for the 526ez user experience. This 6 week period of data will appear in charts as "Pre-launch." [[See full report here.]](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/research/2024-08-Toxic-Exposure/2024-08-Medallia-Review.md)
  
### Guiding Questions for UX Monitoring
1. What portion of Veterans are choosing to answer the TE questions? [opt-in %]
2. When are Veterans abandoning the TE flow? Are we seeing more drop-offs than baseline at later points in the form?
3. What challenges (usability issues, bugs, general pain points) are Veterans encountering with the feature? 
4. How satisfied are Veterans with the overall performance of the feature?[Intercept and Feedback customer satisfaction]
5. What impact does the new feature have on Veteran trust in VA?
