## Overview
We are reviewing Medallia data from July 2024 so we can establish a baseline for what to expect from the survey data before we launch Toxic Exposure. This will help us distinguish ongoing UX challenges from those caused by the rollout.

## Summary of responses

### Feedback survey
Between July 1 and August 9, 2024, the Medallia Feedback survey received **462 responses.** 

User feedback was most concentrated on the first and last pages of the form.
|Rank|Top Feedback Pages|# of responses| % of total responses|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|Introduction| 116 | 25% |
|2| Confirmation| 76 |16%|
|3| Start | 64 | 14% |
|4| Review & Submit| 19 | 4%|

### Intercept survey
Between July 1 and August 9, 2024, the Medallia Intercept survey received **85 responses.** 

User feedback was most concentrated at the very beginning of the form, despite the fact that it is intended to more evenly  “intercept” 5% of VA.gov users who have had a 20-second or more extended session. This is a known problem and already ticketed (#88712), but this data pull reinforces our hunch. 

|Rank|Top Intercept Pages|# of responses| % of total responses|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|Introduction| 42 | 49% |
|2| Start| 22 | 26%|
|3| Veteran Information | 7 | 8% |
  
### Coding Responses
I coded all qualitative user feedback using the codes developed in our last Medallia data review (October 2023) and added new ones as needed. 
|Code|Feedback count| Intercept count|Definition|
|--|--|--|--|
|General| 141|8| Responses that included non-specific qualitative information, such as "filing"|
|Usability| 33 |--|Responses that describe specific usability issues not encompassed by other tags. For example, 6 Veterans struggled to complete the Reserves National Guard page|
|PACT| 26|--| Responses that reference Toxic Exposure or the PACT Act|
|Error| 26|--| Responses that describe an error message they came across in the form |
|Navigation | 23|10| Responses that describe moving from one part of the application to another and wayfinding |
|Getting help| 18|5| Responses that describe seeking help from the hotline, VSOs, professionals, or other sources|
|Evidence/evidence upload| 17|2|Responses that describe evidence or medical records, uploading or downloading|
|Pain point| 11|8|Responses that express distress or frustration, but don’t fall into another tag |
|Submission| 12 |--| Responses that describe submitting their form and/or the confirmation page|
| Bright spot| 1 |14| Positive feedback or something that’s working well|




## Key Findings

- 68% of Veterans reported that they were **NOT** able to complete the task they set out to do [216 out of 318 total responses].

## Themes to Track
