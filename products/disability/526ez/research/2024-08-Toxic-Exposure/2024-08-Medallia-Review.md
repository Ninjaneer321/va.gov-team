## Overview
We are reviewing Medallia data from July 1-August 9 2024 so we can establish a baseline for what to expect from the survey data before we launch Toxic Exposure. This will help us distinguish ongoing UX challenges from those caused by the rollout.

## Summary of responses

### Feedback survey
Between July 1 and August 9, 2024, the Medallia Feedback survey received **462 responses.** 

User feedback was most concentrated on the first and last pages of the form.
|Rank|Top Feedback Pages|# of responses| % of total responses|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|Introduction| 116 | 25% |
|2| Confirmation| 76 |16%|
|3| Start | 64 | 14% |
|4| Review & Submit| 19 | 4%|

### Intercept survey
Between July 1 and August 9, 2024, the Medallia Intercept survey received **85 responses.** 

User feedback was most concentrated at the very beginning of the form, despite the fact that it is intended to more evenly  “intercept” 5% of VA.gov users who have had a 20-second or more extended session. This is a known problem and already ticketed (#88712), but this data pull reinforces our hunch. 

|Rank|Top Intercept Pages|# of responses| % of total responses|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|Introduction| 42 | 49% |
|2| Start| 22 | 26%|
|3| Veteran Information | 7 | 8% |
  
### Coding Responses
I coded all qualitative user feedback using the codes developed in our last Medallia review (March 2023 data) and added new ones as needed. 
|Code|Feedback count| Intercept count|Definition|
|--|--|--|--|
|Usability| 33 |--|Responses that describe specific usability issues not encompassed by other tags. Examples include character limits, inability to update prefill, not being able to continue, etc.|
|PACT| 26|--| Responses that reference Toxic Exposure or the PACT Act|
|Error| 26|--| Responses that describe an error message they came across in the form |
|Navigation | 23|10| Responses that describe moving from one part of the application to another and wayfinding |
|Getting help| 18|5| Responses that describe seeking help from the hotline, VSOs, professionals, or other sources|
|Evidence/evidence upload| 17|2|Responses that describe evidence or medical records, uploading or downloading|
|Pain point| 11|8|Responses that express distress or frustration, but don’t fall into another tag |
|Submission| 12 |--| Responses that describe submitting their form and/or the confirmation page|
|Intent to File| 5| -- |Responses that reference Intent to File or upcoming ITF deadlines|
| Bright spot| 1 |14| Positive feedback or something that’s working well|
|General| 141|8| Responses that included non-specific qualitative information, such as "filing"|


## Key Findings

Findings derived from from March 2023 Medallia data review largely hold in the July 2024 data set. 

|3/2023 Finding | True/False in current data set|Context|Veteran voice|
|--|--|--|--|
|Certain error messages can lead Veterans to frustrating encounters with the Contact Center. | **True** | Veterans are still encountering errors that cannot be resolved by calling the Contact Center|"Trying to file a claim online, called number provided, got transferred 10 times with no help."|
|Error messages block Veterans from filing.| **Less true**| Veterans do not express frustration with ITF errors, but express problems with BIRLS/EDIPI blockers and isolated Participant ID problems (n=3)|"We have tried and tried to get a birls i.d. Or edition with no luck.  We have tried and tried to submit a disability claim with no luck." |
|Veterans are finding themselves misrouted to or stuck on the Reserves National Guard (RNG) page.| **True**| The unit number format confuses Veterans and blocks them from proceeding.|"Trying to fill out form and asked for "Unit Name" tried it every way I could think of."|
|Veterans reported evidence-related challenges throughout the application.|**True**| Difficulties with evidence hold true now. 17 Veterans spoke of issues with uploading files. |" I was not able to complete the form by my Aug XX,2024 deadline because the form seems to be rigged. Every time I select one of the 2 options below my uploaded pdf it automatically deletes several other boxes above or below the other uploads."|


## Themes to Track


- 68% of Veterans reported that they were **NOT** able to complete the task they set out to do [216 out of 318 total responses].
