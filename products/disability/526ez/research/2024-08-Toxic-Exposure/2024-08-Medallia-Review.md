## Overview
We are reviewing Medallia data from July 2024 so we can establish a baseline for what to expect from the survey data before we launch Toxic Exposure. This will help us distinguish ongoing UX challenges from those caused by the rollout.

## Summary of responses

### Feedback survey
Between July 1 and August 9, 2024, the Medallia Feedback survey **received 462 responses.** User feedback was most concentrated on the first and last pages of the form.
|Top Feedback Pages|# of responses| Percentage of total|
|--|--|--|
|Total| 462 | -- |
|Introduction| 116 | % |
| Confirmation| 76 |%|
| Start | 64 | % |
|Review & Submit| 19 | %|

### Intercept survey
Between July 1 and August 9, 2024, the Medallia Intercept survey **received 85 responses.** User feedback was most concentrated at the very beginning of the form, despite the fact that it is intended to more evenly  “intercept” 5% of VA.gov users who have had a 20-second or more extended session. This is a known problem and already ticketed (#88712), but this data pull reinforces our hunch. 

|Top Intercept Pages|# of responses| Percentage of total|
|--|--|--|
|Total | 85 | -- |
|Introduction| 39 | % |
| Start| 22 |%|
| Veteran Information | 7 | % |
  

### Feedback Survey Data



## Key Findings
- 65% of the Intercept responses came from the Start, Introduction, or Veteran Information pages [55 out of 85].
- 68% of Veterans reported that they were **NOT** able to complete the task they set out to do [216 out of 318 total responses].

## Themes to Track
