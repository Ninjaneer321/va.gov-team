## Overview
We are reviewing Medallia data from July 2024 so we can establish a baseline for what to expect from the survey data before we launch Toxic Exposure. This will help us distinguish ongoing UX challenges from those caused by the rollout.

## Summary of responses

### Feedback survey
Between July 1 and August 9, 2024, the Medallia Feedback survey received **462 responses.** 

User feedback was most concentrated on the first and last pages of the form.
|Rank|Top Feedback Pages|# of responses| % of total responses|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|Introduction| 116 | 25% |
|2| Confirmation| 76 |16%|
|3| Start | 64 | 14% |
|4| Review & Submit| 19 | 4%|

### Intercept survey
Between July 1 and August 9, 2024, the Medallia Intercept survey received **85 responses.** 

User feedback was most concentrated at the very beginning of the form, despite the fact that it is intended to more evenly  “intercept” 5% of VA.gov users who have had a 20-second or more extended session. This is a known problem and already ticketed (#88712), but this data pull reinforces our hunch. 

|Rank|Top Intercept Pages|# of responses| % of total responses|
|--|--|--|--|
|1|Introduction| 42 | 49% |
|2| Start| 22 | 26%|
|3| Veteran Information | 7 | 8% |
  
### Coding Responses
I coded all qualitative user feedback using the codes developed in our last Medallia data review (October 2023) and added new ones as needed. 
|Code|Feedback count| Intercept count|Definition|
|--|--|--|--|
|General| 141|8| Responses that included non-specific qualitative information, such as "filing"|
|Usability| 33 |--|Responses that describe specific usability issues not encompassed by other tags. For example, 6 Veterans struggled to complete the Reserves National Guard page|
|PACT| 26|--| Responses that reference Toxic Exposure or the PACT Act|
|Error| 26|--| Responses that describe an error message they came across in the form |
|Navigation | 23|10| Responses that describe moving from one part of the application to another and wayfinding |
|Getting help| 18|5| Responses that describe seeking help from the hotline, VSOs, professionals, or other sources|
|Evidence/evidence upload| 17|2|Responses that describe evidence or medical records, uploading or downloading|
|Pain point| 11|8|Responses that express distress or frustration, but don’t fall into another tag |
|Submission| 12 |--| Responses that describe submitting their form and/or the confirmation page|
|Intent to File| 5| -- | 5| Responses that reference Intent to File or upcoming ITF deadlines|
| Bright spot| 1 |14| Positive feedback or something that’s working well|


## Key Findings

- Findings from March 2023 Medallia data review are largely consistent with July 2024 data. Shown improvement

|March 2023 Finding | Is finding true/false in July 2024?|Context|
|--|--|
|Veterans face blockers that require external support—but sometimes find that help difficult to get.| True | 
|Certain error messages can lead Veterans to frustrating encounters with the Contact Center. | True | Veterans are still encountering errors that cannot be resolved by calling the Contact Center|
|Error messages block Veterans from filing.| Less true| Veterans do not express frustration with ITF errors, but express problems with BIRLS/EDIPI blockers and isolated (n=3) Participant ID problems | "Tried to complete prior service info (3 active Army periods accepted; 1 Army Reserve period rejected). Form did not accept "pattern" when specifying unit which the form demanded to be entered. It gave no clue as to what pattern it wanted. This has stopped my work on the form because form won't let me move forward. Please put clear instructions on form, not ambiguous demands, also allow applicants to work the rest of the form rather than be shut out.   Thanks for asking how it went."|
|Veterans are finding themselves misrouted to or stuck on the Reserves National Guard (RNG) page.| True| The unit number format confuses Veterans 
|Veterans reported evidence-related challenges throughout the application.|True|

- 68% of Veterans reported that they were **NOT** able to complete the task they set out to do [216 out of 318 total responses].
