## Goals

1. Do Veterans understand who is and is not eligible for dependents' benefits?
2. Does the flow of form 686 make sense? Are Veterans successfully able to apply?
3. Do all the form labels make sense, and the Veterans aren't confused by what we're asking from them? Do they know whose information we are asking for at any given time?
4. Are Veterans confused or frustrated by any questions on the form? What are their reactions to questions about their marriages and spouses' marriages?
5. Do they know what to expect after they apply?
6. Would Veterans prefer to fill out additional 674 questions here or at another time? How would they prefer to be alerted to fill out these forms?

## We will know we have been successful if:

1. We have a clearer understanding of whether Veterans are easily able to fill out form 686 online, and which sections require the most frustration or collection of information (if any).
2. We have a sense as to how Veterans would want to fill out additional forms related to 686.

## Who are our participants?

We would like to speak with 6-8 Veteran participants representing all branches of the Armed Forces, with an even split of men and women, and at least one person in each of the age brackets 18-30, 30-50, 50+.

All participants must have a disability rating of 30% or greater.

At least half (3) of the participants must have dependents who have in the past used or are currently using VA benefits through the participants' service.

We would like at least one veteran and their spouse to both be in at least their second marriage.

We would like at least one veteran to have a child who is between ages 18-23 and enrolled in school.

Additionally, we would like to speak with one spouse of a Veteran.

## Key research questions

1. Are Veterans and their dependents able to fill out form 686c with as little frustration or confusion as possible?
2. What are the most difficult portions of the form for Veterans or their dependents to fill out? Why?
3. If Veterans or their dependents are able to remember their first time filling out this form, does this version compare more favorably to that experience?
4. Would Veterans or their dependents prefer to fill out the additional form 674 content at the same time? If not, how would they want to be prompted to return to this content?
5. Do Veterans and their dependents understand who is and is not eligible for dependents' benefits?

## Methods

- Remote usability testing of front-end app of introduction page and form flow for 686c form.
