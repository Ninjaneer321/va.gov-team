# Current Condition Evidence: Veteran Discovery

## Intro
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to listen in. But before we get to them, I’ll tell you about myself and what we’re doing today.
My colleagues and I work on VA.gov - making improvements to the site so that Veterans can submit their strongest disability claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. What I hope to do today is to get a sense of how to best assist Veterans in putting together a strong case for their claim. We’ll look at some sample information to get your feedback.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
-*This entire session should take about 60 minutes.* I want to be sure that we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
-*In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.* There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
-*Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.* You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
-I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to listen in to this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
  -If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  -If yes: Admit observers.
-Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
-*Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?* We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
  -If yes: Once I start recording, I’ll ask again for your confirmation.
