# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:

# Research plan for PACT Act / presumptive claims veteran research

## Background

The VA is preparing for an increase in disability claims that is expected upon passage of the PACT Act, which would make more veterans eligible for benefits (both compensation and health care) for conditions that were a result of toxic exposure during service, including from burn pits and Agent Orange. We would like to learn more about how veterans, who have been exposed to burn pits or Agent Orange and have suffered health impacts, think about submitting claims for those conditions.

Our team is considering multiple interventions to improve the experience of PACT Act veterans on va.gov (in collaboration with the VFS Benefits team) as well as how to improve processing on the back end.

- [In-progress product brief](https://www.notion.so/Presumptive-Claim-Support-Product-Brief-VA-OCTO-Benefits-Delivery-Team-e017059380c64fbab5d6021865085ef8)

## OCTO Objectives

### North stars

- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
- Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome

### Specific goals

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online (e.g. by supporting online applications for supplemental claims)
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey

Services and products coming out of this effort would support **Taking Care of Myself**, specifically **Managing primary care and chronic health issues** (a moment that matters!) in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

## Research Goals

- Better understand how impacted veterans decide on which conditions to list on their claim application (either 526 or 0995)
- Better understand how impacted veterans decide whether to submit an original or supplemental claim for a PACT Act condition, or something else.
- Better understand how aware veterans are of the PACT Act and its implications.

## Outcome

This research will help us understand:

- How we might guide PACT Act veterans towards submitting the correct form for their presumptive claim (either 526 or 0995)
- How and if we might guide veterans to clearly claim conditions that are covered via the PACT Act, so they can be routed for faster processing
- Better understand what language to use in outreach to PACT Act veterans and on related pages on va.gov

## Research questions

### Understand how veterans choose which claim form to use

- How well do veterans remember what conditions they've claimed in the past (ergo, should they now submit a new or a supplemental claim?)
- How would a veteran choose between submitting an original claim or a supplemental claim? Would they consider submitting a different type of claim for a condition that is newly presumptive under the PACT Act

### Understand how veterans pick what to list as their conditions and how to describe them

- How clued in are veterans to veteran groups that provide advice on how to submit a successful claim (how to 'hack' the VA bureaucracy)?
- How comfortable would a veteran be if, once logged in, the supplemental claim application form presented them with a list of presumptive conditions they'd previously claimed? (Or otherwise nudged them towards a specific way to describe a condition?)

### Understand how familiar veterans are with the PACT Act

- Has a veteran heard of / how familiar are they with:
    - The PACT Act?
    - Burn pit (Agent Orange, toxic exposure) legislation efforts?
    - presumptive claims?

## Method

We will use semi-structured interviews for open-ended exploration.

### Location

We will be conducting these interviews remotely, over Zoom.

### Research materials

- [Conversation guide](PACT-act-veterans-conversation-guide.md)
