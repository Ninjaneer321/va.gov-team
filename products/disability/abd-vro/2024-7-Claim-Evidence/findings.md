## Research Goals
Our research in this phase aimed to get a directional signal on this core question: 

>Can content influence Veterans to provide better evidence of a current condition when they file a claim?

## Research Questions
We specifically sought to learn: 

1. How do Veterans currently think about what information they need to provide for a new condition they’re claiming?

2. Can we provide information that will give Veterans a better understanding of what is required?

3. How useful is it to have information specifically related to the Veteran’s claimed condition?

4. If Veterans do gain a better understanding, are they more likely to provide evidence of a current condition? 

5. What else might be getting in the way?


## Methodology
We conducted 8 one-hour remote Veteran interviews conducted over Zoom. We used a mix of open-ended questions and content prototype evaluation. The content in each prototype described what evidence was sufficient to demonstrate a current condition. Each participant saw a prototype that had generic language that applied to all conditions. For the second prototype, participants either saw content specific to hypertension (that requires specific medical evidence), or to tinnitus (where a personal statement describing the symptoms is sufficient).

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
**Hypothesis:** Providing better information around what evidence of a current condition is required will influence some Veterans to provide the evidence needed to move their claim forward.
- TRUE. Some Veterans (5 out of 8 participants) would have changed the way they filed a claim with the information provided in our content prototypes.

## Key Findings
**1. Content could influence first-time filers to provide better evidence for their condition.** 
5 out of 8 participants said the test content would have changed how they filed a previous claim.

**2. Examples of what kinds of evidence to submit affirmed and excited Veterans.** 
Providing clear guidance on what kinds of evidence to submit could increase Veteran confidence and trust.

**3. Veterans need education to refine their evidence strategy.**
Some Veterans weren’t aware they could submit a personal statement that describes their symptoms, where others modified their evidence strategy based on their experience of previous claims.

**4. Veterans had a slight preference for the condition-specific prototypes.** 
4 out of 8 Veterans preferred the condition-specific prototype over the generic text, 2 preferred the generic text, and 2 had no preference.

**5. Veterans valued more concise text.**
Regardless of which prototype they preferred, most Veterans expressed appreciation for content that was brief and to the point.

**6. Under-submitters expect VA to tell them what evidence is needed.**
This expectation is misaligned with how VA actually processes disability claims.

## Details of Findings and Recommendations
### 1. Content could influence behavior change for first-time filers
5 participants said this content would have changed the way they filed their past claims. This included 2 of the 3 under-submitters.
- 5 out of 8 participants said the test content would have changed how they filed a previous claim.
- 2 participants said content would not change their behavior.
- Only 1 participant (not a Veteran yet) had never filed a claim before.

> P1: "It's simple for me because this is not my first time. My first time, I was very confused on what to send them. It's hard."
> P6: "If I saw this content on Day 1, this would have helped me avoid 10 years of trial and error: filing claims, getting denied, getting a lawyer."

### 2. Examples of evidence to submit affirmed and excited Veterans.
Veterans were excited for the VA to tell them exactly what they needed to submit. While there's a lot of uncertainty and questions about claims, examples of what to submit gave Veterans more confidence.
- 1 participant considered the Generic (Apple) content "more honest" than what he was told before. This participant had been led to believe that the VA would investigate each condition he claimed, and that he didn’t need to provide any evidence upfront.

> P1: "It's easy for me to relate to, very easy for me to file because it really relates to my situation."
> P6: "Examples like what we saw in the tinnitus put the bow on the gift. It helps me know that what I'm submitting is right. It gives me warm fuzzies."

### 3. Veterans need education to refine their evidence strategy.
Some Veterans were unaware of the option to claim something based solely on their own description of symptoms. Other Veterans learned from previously-filed claims the importance of including medical evidence and personal statements to support their claim.
- 4 out of 8 Veterans believe it's critical to provide a medical diagnosis, with 2 saying they wouldn't bother to submit without one

> P2: "I never knew that you could do a personal statement, especially the part that you could describe. I thought you needed an actual diagnosis."
> P6: "It doesn't mean anything until I get a diagnosis."
> P3: "I've never claimed something I didn't have documentation for. Maybe a C&P appointment, buddy statements. But if you don't have any documentation to prove it, it's kind of hard to prove."

### 4. Veterans had a slight preference for the condition-specific prototypes.
Half of participants preferred the condition-specific prototypes (with examples provided for either Hypertension or Tinnitus), preferring the clear specificity by condition. The other half either preferred the generic prototype, because it suited multiple conditions, or had no preference.
- 4 out of 8 Veterans preferred a condition-specific prototype
- 2 Veterans preferred the generic prototype
- 2 Veterans preferred a mix or both prototypes (no preference)

> P5: "Both [prototypes] are perfect. Apple is more open. Orange is more specific."
> P1: "This [content] would have helped me out a lot. It would have been a lot less confusing for me. They would have asked for specific to PTSD."

### 5. Veterans valued more concise text.
The generic text, by nature, had to cover more information making the content lengthy. Veterans found the specific text easier to process, with more than one Veteran preferring text in a bulleted format, like a step or a checklist.
- 4 out of 8 Veterans said they valued the short, to-the-point length of text

> P6: "I like that it's straight to the point, it's not a 12-page article about what to upload. VA has a reputation of giving a lot of information."
> P2: "Apple is more detailed. I like Orange better for some reason...it went step by step."

### 6. Under-submitters expect VA to tell them what's needed.
Veterans who under-submit evidence believe that VA knows best and will inform them of any missing evidence that's needed to complete their claim.
- 3 out of 8 Veterans were considered under-submitters

> P1: "Those records are available to me, but I don't want to send them if the VA doesn't want them. It's just time consuming."
> P3: "I don't think the VA expects you to have everything as soon as you apply."


## Recommendations
Our next steps follow 3 tracks, which can be pursued concurrently:
### Track 1: What is the most effective solution?
This track employs design exploration and usability testing to answer the following questions: 
- **Where should we put this content to ensure Veterans can find it?** We have 2 obvious options – in the information and resources section of va.gov, and/or embedded within the online 526 form itself (where there are several placement options).
- **Should we launch first with a generic version of the content, which is a lower lift but potentially less clear to Veterans, or begin with specific versions of the content for a few given contentions?**

### Track 2: Release a simple MVP into production and begin gathering metrics.
In parallel, we could release a simple version of the content and set up metrics tracking to see if even this minimal version can have a measurable impact on Veteran behavior.

### Track 3: Develop the capacity to track downstream impacts.
Both solutions necessitate the ability to track downstream claim lifecycle events and pair that data with claims that are within our experimental and control groups.

## Conclusion
Our research found that providing better guidance on the types of evidence needed to prove a current condition could influence some Veterans to provide better evidence. Better evidence submissions would speed up claim processing and ensure that more claims are considered and potentially granted. The current guidance we provide to Veterans focuses on types of documents – VA medical records, Private Medical Records, etc – and doesn’t indicate what type of content those records need to show. This is a significant gap in how we support Veterans in the claims process. 
We believe that providing this type of information to Veterans can help make VA.gov claims easier to process for claims adjudicators, as well as increase trust that Veterans have in the VA.
