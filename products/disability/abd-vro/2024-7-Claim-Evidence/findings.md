## Research Goals
Our research in this phase aimed to get a directional signal on this core question: 

>Can content influence Veterans to provide better evidence of a current condition when they file a claim?

## Research Questions
We specifically sought to learn: 

1. How do Veterans currently think about what information they need to provide for a new condition they’re claiming?

2. Can we provide information that will give Veterans a better understanding of what is required?

3. How useful is it to have information specifically related to the Veteran’s claimed condition?

4. If Veterans do gain a better understanding, are they more likely to provide evidence of a current condition? 

5. What else might be getting in the way?


## Methodology
We conducted 8 one-hour remote Veteran interviews conducted over Zoom. We used a mix of open-ended questions and content prototype evaluation. The content in each prototype described what evidence was sufficient to demonstrate a current condition. Each participant saw a prototype that had generic language that applied to all conditions. For the second prototype, participants either saw content specific to hypertension (that requires specific medical evidence), or to tinnitus (where a personal statement describing the symptoms is sufficient).

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
**Hypothesis:** Providing better information around what evidence of a current condition is required will influence some Veterans to provide the evidence needed to move their claim forward.
- TRUE. Some Veterans (5 out of 8 participants) would have changed the way they filed a claim with the information provided in our content prototypes.

## Key Findings
**1. Content could influence first-time filers to provide better evidence for their condition.** 
5 out of 8 participants said the test content would have changed how they filed a previous claim.

**2. Examples of what kinds of evidence to submit affirmed and excited Veterans.** 
Providing clear guidance on what kinds of evidence to submit could increase Veteran confidence and trust.

**3. Veterans need education to refine their evidence strategy.**
Some Veterans weren’t aware they could submit a personal statement that describes their symptoms, where others modified their evidence strategy based on their experience of previous claims.

**4. Veterans had a slight preference for the condition-specific prototypes.** 
4 out of 8 Veterans preferred the condition-specific prototype over the generic text, 2 preferred the generic text, and 2 had no preference.

**5. Veterans valued more concise text.**
Regardless of which prototype they preferred, most Veterans expressed appreciation for content that was brief and to the point.

**6. Under-submitters expect VA to tell them what evidence is needed.**
This expectation is misaligned with how VA actually processes disability claims.
