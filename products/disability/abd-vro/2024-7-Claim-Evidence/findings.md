## Research Goals
Our research in this phase aimed to get a directional signal on this core question: 

>Can content influence Veterans to provide better evidence of a current condition when they file a claim?

## Research Questions
We specifically sought to learn: 

1. How do Veterans currently think about what information they need to provide for a new condition they’re claiming?

2. Can we provide information that will give Veterans a better understanding of what is required?

3. How useful is it to have information specifically related to the Veteran’s claimed condition?

4. If Veterans do gain a better understanding, are they more likely to provide evidence of a current condition? 

5. What else might be getting in the way?


## Methodology

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
**Hypothesis:** Providing better information around what evidence of a current condition is required will influence some Veterans to provide the evidence needed to move their claim forward.
- TRUE. Some Veterans (5 out of 8 participants) would have changed the way they filed a claim with the information provided in our content prototypes.
