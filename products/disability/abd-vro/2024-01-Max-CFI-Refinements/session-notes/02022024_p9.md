Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 
- Yes

## Warm-up Questions  - 5 minutes 

- 18 years to get to 100%. About a year ago. It’s absurd.  
- Has done several research sessions already so familiar with how it works. 

Talk to me about your past experience using the VA.gov website?  
- I didn’t use the website usually. Supposedly dealt directly with the VA. Maybe I shouldn’t have done that.  
- Use the messaging to talk to my doctors. Order my medicine online for home delivery. It’s great! 

Could you tell me about the types of benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time?  
- Disability benefits, health care. 
If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask: 
About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for? 
- Looking for reference material. 
- My rating was based on 6 or 7 things. started with Agent Orange. Was in Vietnam in 69. It blossomed as I found out you could get compensation for this or that. Through talking to Vets. 

## Scenario Yellow: Review 526 with accordions - 20 minutes 

**Screen 1 (Start)**

**Screen 2 (Select new or existing condition)**

**Screen 3 (View my Rated Disabilities Screen)**

Let’s pause on this screen. Feel free to explore it, but please do not click on anything just yet while I ask you a few questions. 

What is this screen telling you? What is your initial impression of it? 
- Scrolls down. Notices the accordion. It’s the same three answers that were on the other page. 

What does this screen tell you about your conditions?  

Do you think you are eligible for more compensation? 

For which conditions?  
- Hypertension. You’re rated at 10%, you’re not going to get any more than what you’re rated for. 
- You could stand on your head, they’re not going to give you any more.
- the way they combine it is STUPID. 
- “These re the feeling sof a Vet who’s been through this and put up with this nonsense. ... Take what you can get and move on.” 

What does the phrase ‘maximum standard rating’ mean to you? 

What would you do on this screen? 
- I’d go for hypertension. Only 10%, but a little bit is better than nothing. 
- “Thye’re gonna make you fight tooth and nail to get it. That’s the main problem. You have to fight so much.” 

(If they haven’t noticed the gray boxes) If you wanted more information about the maximum rating for Tinnitus, what would you do? 

Can you find anything on this page that could tell you more about a maximum standard rating? What do you think those gray boxes are about with the plus sign? 

If you’re interested, read it. 
- Is interpreting the Hypertension 10% as saying you’re not going to get any more.

CS: Why won’t you get more than 10%? 
- Because they’re already decided. 
- These raters, they don’t care. They don’t give a damn about you. They’re just interested in sending the government money. Hoping you’re going to eventually quit and stop bothering you. If you get a 100%, you won and they lost. With the raters I’m sure it’s nothing personal, they’re just doing what they’re told to do. 

(If participant selects first question) What can you tell me about this explanation for maximum standard rating? 
- reads first section. It just tells you “you got what you got” self explanatory 
- Second heading: why they’re going to tell you no. Doesn’t read it. Doesn’t notice the XS content. 

Third heading: Reads it.  

(If participant selects second question) What can you tell me about this explanation for if you’re at the max rating and your condition has gotten worse? 

 

(If participant selects third question) What can you tell me about how to apply for a rating that’s higher than the maximum standard rating? 

 

What do you think you would do after reading that/those message(s)? 

To me, it’s very cut-and-dry. I’d click Continue and see what’s next. 

What do you think you might do here to potentially increase your overall rating? 

 

This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase?
