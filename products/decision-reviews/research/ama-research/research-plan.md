# Research Plan

Unicorns, Decision Reviews, December 2019

## Goals
- The primary goal of this research is to understand how veterans navigate to the Decision Reviews section of the website. 
- The secondary goal is to understand how veterans determine which Decision Review process lane is right for their needs.

### Background
Currently, we have very little research on how users find the Decision Reviews section of the website. 'Decision Review' is the process prescribed by the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA), a law that was enacted to create a more simplified experience for veterans to appeal their benefits decisions. 

As this process will be be exclusive moving forward (Feb 19, 2020), we are interested in understanding how veterans and their representatives gain information on Decision Reviews and where experiential gaps might exist within that process.


### Research questions
- How do veterans navigate to the Decision Review section of the website?
	- What is their path and thought process?
	- What information on the website helps them navigate to the Decision Reviews section of the website?
	- Within the Decision Reviews section:
		- What page information is useful to them?
		- What helps them make a decision about which lane is correct for them?
- How do veterans determine which appeals lane is correct for them?
	- What do they already know about Decision Reviews?
	- Do they understand the difference between Decision Reviews and the currently existing (legacy) appeals process?
	- How does the VA communicate Decision Reviews to veterans and their representatives?


### Hypotheses
- Veterans may have difficulty in locating the Decision Reviews section of the website because there is currently no clear path that funnels them to it.
- There are opportunities to improve the communication and experience around Decision Reviews to help veterans and their representatives determine which appeals lane is best for their situation. 

## Method
- We have conducted quantitative research on the Decision Reviews section fo the website via Google Analytics.

- We will be using remote, moderated usability studies because we need to talk to Veterans to understand where they expect to be able to file appeals on VA.gov. 

- We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.
  
- We will ask Veterans to navigate to VA.gov and share their screens with us via Zoom.


## Participants
- 8-10 Veterans
- Must have filed a disability claim

## Recruitment
We will work with Perigean for recruiting.
