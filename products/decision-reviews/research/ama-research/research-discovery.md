# Research Plan for [AMA Veteran tool, VA.gov, 6/20 - 7/03]
## Goals
1. After working on Caseflow Intake, learning the pain points of transferring information from paper forms -- often trying to transcribe the intent of the Veteran in handwritten or improperly filled out forms -- we want to better understand the current mindset, user needs, and user journey of Veterans requesting a Decision Review.

2. Explore Hypothesis (1): An online tool can ease the pain points of requesting a decision review.

## Segmentation
We will like to talk to Veterans requesting a Higher-Level Review, Decision Review or Suplemental Claim.

## Method
1. Direct Interviews, with the ability to share a view of the paper form with the Veteran.  This can be done remotely via Zoom.Participants and Recruitment1.Participant criteria: Veterans (15-20) of a wide range of ages, from diverse parts of the country who already have a va.gov login and are inthe process of requesting a higher-Level Review.

2. Recruitment strategy: Remote interviews. The veteran will need to be logged in to zoom and in front of a computer. We will ask questions andpresent them with a scanned form and ask for their opinions.

## When?
1. Timeline: Flexible but preferably the week of 6/20 â€“ 7/03
2. Prepare: We will prepare for the calls on June 17 - 19. We can test out all the tools and do a prep review of the script
3. Length of Sessions: 45 minutes
4. Availability: 10am-7pm West Coast Time
