# Decision Reviews Enhanced Onramp Research Strategy

## 2025

Research and Design: Eileen Chi  
Product: Maurice DeBeary

## Background

Today, the process for appealing an unfavorable claims decision is complicated and lengthy. Veterans have to decide on which decision review option to pursue: supplemental claims, higher level review, and/or appealing to the Board of Appeals. Each option is associated with lengthy wait times, with veterans often waiting more than 100 days to receive a final decision. Disability compensation appeals make up the overwhelming majority of VA benefits decision appeals.

Past research done on this topic has shown that although information exists on VA.gov regarding choosing a decision review pathway, Veterans found it hard to find and consume information, and decide if it’s relevant to their situation. They expressed interest in reaching out to an accredited representative. With this research effort, we want to test if Veterans are better able to understand the decision review options if we provide it in a piecemeal format that lets them answer based on their situation.

BVA also made efforts to increase the

## Research Plan

**Phase 1\.** Validate that the decision tree we’ve created aligns with how Veterans are considering between Decision Review options, and uncover any other aspects that may cause hesitation in decision-making  
**Phase 2\.** Validate that separating a single decision tree into three pre-form questionnaire can accomplish goals with the same effectiveness

### Research Goals

1. Identify opportunities to improve the decision review selection for Veterans.  
2. Validate our hypothesis about how a Veteran’s approach to deciding on a pathway.  
3. Identify the resources that build Veteran confidence when making a pathway choice.

### Research questions

Identify opportunities to improve the decision review service selection for Veterans.

1. Where are Veterans experiencing friction when they are looking to file a decision review?  
2. How much knowledge do they have about the decision review process before making a choice?

Validate our hypothesis about how a Veteran’s approach to deciding on a pathway.

1. How are Veterans responding to the guided decision review process?  
2. Where do Veterans experience friction while going through the guided process?  
3. Does the guided decision review process improve the Veteran’s experience in choosing a decision review process?  
4. Were Veterans able to decide on a decision review pathway using this process?

Identify the resources that build Veteran confidence when making a pathway choice.

1. Are Veterans interacting with additional resource pages provided within the guided process? How do they respond to the resource pages?  
2. What resources are Veterans relying on when they research the decision review process?
3. How are Veterans responding to the ability to connect with an accredited representative?  

### Outcome

We'll use the findings from this research to iterate on the guided decision review process and use it to decide on the final Minimum Viable Product for this release.

### Hypothesis 

1. We believe that users will benefit from a guided decision review process.  
2. We believe that appropriate resources will be surfaced for users looking for more information regarding decision reviews.
3. We believe that separating the guided decision review into three separate pre-form questionnaire does not decrease it's effectiveness to help Veterans.

### Possible Methods of testing
- Moderated interview + usability testing
