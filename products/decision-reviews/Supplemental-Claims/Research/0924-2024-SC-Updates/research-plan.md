Research and Design: Eileen Chi

Product: 

## Background

Updates have been made to the 20-0995 form, which includes introduction of several optional new sections and fields. 

[Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/decision-reviews/Supplemental-Claims)

  

## OCTO Priorities

✅  Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

✅  Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.

  

## Veteran Journey

Since Veterans can file Supplemental Claims benefits with VA between 180 and 90 days before separating from the military, this work impacts the Veteran journey from serving, to getting out, and all the way to dying as survivors can also file Supplemental Claims on the Veteran’s behalf.  
  
This work especially maps to the taking care of myself part of the Veteran journey, as Supplemental Claims for disability compensation supports:

  

- Recognizing and addressing mental health needs

- Managing primary care and chronic health issues

- Maintaining my health


## Research Goals

1. Determine if the Supplemental Claims updates create any new points of friction within the form
	1. Validate if Veterans understand (or skip if ineligible) the series of homelessness questions
    1. Validate that users are able to understand if they’re eligible for and respond to the VHA MST Notifications question
    1. Validate that users are able to understand what it means to submit a piece of non-VA evidence (submitting a 4142/a)
2.  Validate that the users are able to complete the new Supplemental Claim flow
3. Validate that AT-users are able to navigate through the entire form

### Research questions

#### 1. Determine if the Supplemental Claims updates create any new points of friction within the form

- Do users experience friction within any point of the form?
- Are users able to navigate through the new form flow?
- Do any of the new screens / questions cause any hesitation?

#### 1a. Validate if Veterans understand (or ignore if ineligible) the series of homelessness questions

- Do users understand what homelessness and being at risk of being homeless means?
- Do users know the benefits of disclosing this information?
- Are users comfortable with disclosing this information?
- Do users understand that all the questions are optional in this section?
    

#### 1b. Validate that users are able to understand if they’re eligible for and respond to the VHA MST Notifications question

- How do Veterans interpret the VHA notification option in the form?
- Do veterans understand the options presented to them?
- If not, what do they not understand?
- What do they think will happen if they opt in?
  - If they don’t?
- Is there any important information missing?
- What do they expect to happen when they continue?
    

#### 1c. Validate that users understand what it means to submit a piece of non-VA evidence (submitting a 4142/a)

- Do they understand that VA will get VA evidence for them?
	- If yes, why
	- If no, why

- Do they understand that by getting the VA to assist, they are filling out and also submitting an optional 4142/a form?

#### 2. Validate that the users are able to complete the new Supplemental Claim flow

- Do users understand the accordion behavior to review each section?
- Do they understand how to change their entries?
- Can they successfully review each entry?
- Can they confidently agree to the privacy policy?
- Do they feel confident submitting their claim?
- What do they expect to happen next?

#### 3. Validate that AT-users are able to navigate through the entire form

- All of the necessary actions can be taken by screen reader users
- Observe if there’s any point of friction within the process

### Outcome

We'll use the findings from this research to iterate on anything critical that impedes the user from completing the form, add notable enhancements and concerns for the backlog.

### Hypothesis 

1. We believe that all users will still be able to successfully complete a Supplemental Claim. 
2. We believe Veterans will disclose the information that is most relevant to them.
3. We believe Veterans will be able to provide the relevant information that could lead to a more favorable outcome by submitting through this digital experience.

## Methodology

We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom using a code prototype. This method will enable us to observe participants attempting to file a claim with clear objectives given to them.

### Recruitment approach

Inclusive recruitment prioritizing a full sample of Veterans that use screen readers due to low vision or blindness. We would like to request a Kickoff Call with Perigean.

#### Recruitment criteria

List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study.

We would like to recruit 2 cohorts, with 5 completed sessions with Veterans per cohort, please recruit 10 Veterans for each cohort, so 10 completed sessions between cohorts, and recruit 20 total.

Primary criteria (must-haves) What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?

##### First Cohort (AT Testing)

- Have a working microphone on their device
    
- Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen
    

##### Second Cohort

- All participants must be Veterans
    
- 3/2 split between desktop/mobile users

## Timeline

Please submit artifacts for Research Review 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

  

### Prepare

Before recruitment starts, we would like to request a kickoff call with Perigean to align on recruitment criteria and terminology for screener questions in the survey and emails that will be sent to Veterans. We would also like to discuss the relative priorities of recruitment criteria and how the criteria are prioritized when recruiting replacements for participants who cancel in advance.

  

The team is available for a kickoff call during any of these times:

  

9/3

  

Please invite Eileen (eileen.chi@coforma.io), Skyler ([skyler.schain@coforma.io](mailto:skyler.schain@coforma.io)) to the kickoff call.

  

Prior to the kickoff call, we would like a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey for this study so we can review it beforehand.

  

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

  

Pilot participant email: TBD

Date and time of pilot session: TBD

### Research sessions

Planned dates of research:

  

Cohort 1: 9/9-9/13

Cohort 2: 9/16-9/20

### Length of sessions

Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours):

- 90 minutes for first cohort
    
- 120 minutes for second cohort (screen readers)
    

Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)

- 60 minutes buffer
    

Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

- 2 per day
    

### Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

  

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
