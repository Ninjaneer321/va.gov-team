# (WIP) Accessible record of an appeal submission
Research and Design: Eileen Chi
Moderator: Eileen Chi
Product: Sade Ragsdale
Observers: Sade Ragsdale, Ruben Sun, David Kennedy, Julie Strothman

## Background
Today, when Veterans file an appeal on va.gov, there is no way for them to maintain a record of their submission. To increase Veteran trust of the reliability of our products, we want to provide the ability to retain a copy of a submitted appeal, so Veterans can store it in their personal records.

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports 2 of the 2024 OCTO Objectives: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits. Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.
This research supports OCTO 2023 priorities 2 and 6:
* Solidify the VA.gov platform
* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

It also supports OCTO goals 5 and 6:
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the ~[Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)~? Are there moments that matter?
Key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:
* Engaging VA to access benefits and services
* Finding additional sources of income
* Taking care of my health
This research also touches on aging and managing new needs for those that develop vision issues or blindness later in life.

## Research Goals
1. Evaluate the effectiveness and value of the accessible submitted appeal page for Veterans using screen readers.
2. Understand how Veterans using screen readers are currently accessing and storing a copy of their appeal submission.
3. Understand where Veterans using screen readers expect to access, and how they expect to use a copy of their submission.

## Research Questions
**GOAL 1: Evaluate the effectiveness and value of the accessible submitted appeal copy page for Veterans using screen readers.**
* Do Veterans using screen readers know that they can review a copy of their submission through the confirmation page?
* Do Veterans using screen readers seek to review a copy of their submission?

**GOAL 2: Understand how Veterans using screen readers are getting copies of their submitted form.**
* How do Veterans using screen readers access a copy of their submission?
* How do Veterans using screen readers save a copy of their submission?

**GOAL 3. Understand where Veterans using screen readers expect to access, and how they expect to use a copy of their submission.**
* Where do Veterans using screen readers expect to access a record of their submitted form?
* What do Veterans using screen readers want to do with a copy of their submission?

## Methodology
* Usability testing with assistive technology users through code prototype shared on the staging environment. We tested the first version with 9 participants, and the second version with 6 participants.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
* We hypothesize that the copy of the submission page will be usable by Veterans using screen readers. They will be able to understand it and save it. **Mostly True**
  * Veterans using assistive technology found the page to be very accessible (rated as a 4 or 5 out of 5). Screenreader users rated the page as a 5.
* We hypothesize that there is a need for Veterans, including those using screen readers, to save a copy of their submission. **Mostly True**
  * Most Veterans saw a need for the option to either download or print the submission fr their records. Some would even take both actions just to have backups. 
  * A few Veterans mentioned a lack of trust in VA’s ability to to receive submissions or records as a reasoning for why they’d want to keep their own.
  * One Veteran mentioned that it wasn’t necessary to save a copy because they knew what information they’ve submitted, and they didn’t want to manage more files as a blind Veteran. They did mention having the expectation that it would be accessible online via the Claim Status Tool.
* We hypothesize that Veterans using screen readers would want to return to copy of submission page at a later time. **Mostly False**
  * Although most Veterans prefer a method to receive a hardcopy of their submission, they didn’t express interest in coming back to the site to see this information. A few reasons include, not having the expectations for VA to keep sensitive information for long periods, difficulty navigating through VA.gov website to find this information, and feeling more secure in a paper trail they can manage.
* We hypothesize that two of the four methods of storing results (PDF and printing) will be less valuable if a Veteran is blind and/or rely on a screen reader. **Maybe True**
  * 5 out of 7 Veterans using a screen reader expressed interest in downloading the PDF to save as a digital copy for their records. 
  * Although Veterans using a screen reader aren’t happy with the accessibility of PDFs, they expect it from VA, and use OCR or similar technology to help read inaccessible PDFs.
  * 3 out of 7 Veterans using a screen reader expressed interest in printing a copy to store in their physical cabinet and/or to share with people who help them manage their claims and records.
 
## Key Findings
1. Veterans found a separate page for a copy of their submission was redundant to the confirmation page, and the link language misled Veterans into believing the form was not yet submitted.
2. Veterans prefer saving a digital or physical hardcopy of their submission rather than returning to a page on VA.gov
3. Veterans found the next steps section valuable, and would want to highlight the timeline for immediate expectations and the rest of the process.
4. Veterans using screen readers expect multiple methods of contact, and prefer being notified by email.
5. Veterans use headers and search to navigate a page, and there is a mixed reaction to the use of lower level headers.
6. Veterans using screen readers expect to receive PDFs from VA and rely on alternate methods to read them when they’re inaccessible.

## Additional Insights
1. Veterans with visual impairments rely on family or caregivers for file management and storage.
> I'll set up a file for it. and probably have probably have a paper copy with this somewhere, I'm sure got it letter, and then my wife files it away and or the file folders. - **P4**

2. There are multiple barriers around gathering and submitting digital evidence 
   * Not self-reporting medical issues during service
   * FOIA requests being returned as large stacks of paper documents or on CDs
   * Needing to familiarize with the digitizing and uploading process
> A couple years ago I made a request for a copy of my medical records and they sent back 2 envelopes about 3 inches thick. I don't need to go back to when it was the sixties. - **P11**

> I mailed in the evidence because there were  medical records from other providers so I mailed it in instead of doing it online because I didn't have digital copies of it. - **P15**

> I send stuff all the time, cause I can't see. I have to trust what people send me, and I have to send it back and forward it, and so on and so forth. So when we use websites like this where we can upload, I have to pay attention to what kind of file it is, cause I know it'll get kicked back if you know the difference between a Jpeg and a PDF and all that. It starts off as French to me, but then, in the end it starts getting drilled into your head. And you pay attention to all those little letters at the end of a a document cause it seems like, everybody wants to pick their favorite and leave all the other ones out. - **P16**

> ROI offices are not allowed to give you anything in a flash drive or emails for security reasons they give it to you in a CD, Is that compatible or you to upload them to these forms on on a computer. - **P16**

3. Blind Veterans recommend the My VA app to manage their claims because of the ease of login, navigation, and use with screen readers.
> Health and benefits app now is a godsend. and in that I can get in there. Look at benefits, look at their claim letters and see where it is that way. But as far as actually filing appeals and things like that, it's more or less our national staff that will do that. - **P8**

> They changed the login process for you, but the app was surprisingly easy, because you were able to use the app with Pr. As I said surprisingly, I figured I had to go find I found my password and all of that which is stored but then, when I went in it was face ID had already set up, and bingo I was in. - **P1** 

4. Reader mode hides certain components

## Recommendations
1. Give Veterans multiple options to save a copy of their submission, including through email.
2. Set clearer expectations to Next Steps, and move time-related information higher up on the page.
3. Include clear method of contact for Veterans 
## Next Steps
1. Our team is workshopping the minimum viable feature based on the research findings.
