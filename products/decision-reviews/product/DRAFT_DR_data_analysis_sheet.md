1. Questions Descriptive Statistics Can Answer:
    * Central Tendency: Descriptive statistics help in understanding the typical or central value of a dataset. This includes measures like mean, median, and mode.
    * Variability/Dispersion: Descriptive statistics provide insights into the spread or variability of data points. This includes measures like range, variance, standard deviation, and interquartile range.
    * Distribution: Descriptive statistics describe how data are distributed across different values. This includes measures like skewness and kurtosis.
    * Association/Correlation: Descriptive statistics can indicate the relationship between variables. This includes measures like covariance and correlation coefficients.
2. Types of Data Used:
    * Numerical Data: Descriptive statistics are commonly applied to numerical data, which can be discrete (e.g., counts) or continuous (e.g., measurements).
    * Categorical Data: Descriptive statistics can also be applied to categorical data, such as frequencies or proportions of different categories.
    * Ordinal Data: Descriptive statistics can describe ordinal data, where the categories have a meaningful order but the differences between them may not be consistent.
3. Common Analysis and Data Errors:
    * Sampling Bias: Descriptive statistics can be skewed if the sample used is not representative of the population being studied, leading to biased estimates.
    * Measurement Errors: Errors in data collection or recording can distort descriptive statistics. For example, inaccurate measurements or data entry mistakes.
    * Outliers: Extreme values in the dataset can significantly affect measures like the mean and standard deviation, potentially misleading interpretations.
    * Misinterpretation of Measures: Misunderstanding or misinterpretation of descriptive statistics can lead to erroneous conclusions. For instance, assuming causation from correlation or misinterpreting the meaning of measures like skewness or kurtosis.
    * Data Transformation Issues: Transformation of data (e.g., log transformation) can impact the interpretation of descriptive statistics if not applied appropriately or if assumptions underlying the transformation are violated.
    * Overreliance on Summary Statistics: Relying solely on summary statistics without considering the underlying distribution or context of the data can lead to incomplete or misleading insights.

### Covariance and Correlation Coefficients: What is the relationship between two variables?

> _Covariance is ideal for measuring the relationship between two variables maximum. It will not provide insight into the strength of the relationship because it is influenced by the scales of the variables, thus is not ideal for capturing the full complexity of multivariate relationships._

### Frequency Distribution: How often is a user event, action, or pattern happening?

### Central Tendency: What is the center point on distribution for a user event or action?

### Variability: What is the degree of dispersion for a given event, action of pattern of behavior across users?
