# Research Plan for Claims and Appeals, HLR, Febr 01, 2020
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
This is a usability test of HLR (Higher Level Review) February 2022. 

Several changes have recently been made to the online HLR form. A comprehensive usability test with actual veterans is needed. 

If a Veteran disagree with VA’s decision, they can request to have a senior reviewer take a new look at their case. The reviewer will determine whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error. Veterans can request a HLR online here: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/higher-level-review/

[Link to product brief](url goes here).

### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

## Research Goals	
1. Understand the current user experience, what usability issues exist, including confusing or unclear content/copy. 
2. Is the flow easy to understand and do participants have all the info they need?
3. Do participants feel that an adequate amount of information is presented?
4. Can participants go through the flow by themselves, without blockers or problems? 

### Outcome
This is a post launch usability test that will relieve and correct any remaining usability issues or pain points.

### Research questions
What usability issues exist within the flow? 
Are participants able to successfully navigate to and through the form without assistance from the moderator? 
Is the content and copy clear and concise? 
Is there ambiguity or confusion experienced by the participants within any of the pages? 
Do the participants feel that they have all the information they need to complete the flow?

### Hypothesis
Veterans can easily go through the HLR flow without any confusion, frustration or blocks. 
Veterans can go through the flow without any assistance. 

## Method	
We will be conducting a remote, moderated usability study with approximately 8 Veterans (separated from active duty).
Allowing users to walk through the Form, on their own, in their own environment (at home) can help us detect usability issues.
We will test the online version of the HLR Form in staging: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/higher-level-review/request-higher-level-review-form-20-0996/start
We will log into staging and give the veteran control of our computer so they can navigate the HLR form. 
We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.
The sessions will include a short interview (3-5 min.) about their experience with VA.gov.
We will ask the participants to go through the HLR Form from its beginning to its end. 
We will ask participants to speak out loud as they move through the form, and probe for usability issues and relevant feedback. 
Pre-test interview questions will probe past experiences to unveil contextual details, key frustrations, and goals/purpose behind accessing the HLR form. 

### Location
Remote through Zoom

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	
OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit using Perigean. 

### Recruitment criteria
8 Veterans for this study. We are used to a certain percentage of no-shows, so Perigean will recruit 15 Veterans to get 8 participants. If 8 Veterans have been interviewed for the usability test, the remaining will be cancelled.  

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
All Participants must be Veterans (separated from active duty). 
The participants must have heard about HLR  OR  have appealed a claims decision in VA before.  
Participants must be willing and able to: use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, the share screen function as well as be willing and able to take over the control of the moderators computer when asked to do this.
Participants should be able to verbally describe to the researcher what they are trying to accomplish, what they are experiencing, and what they are thinking, as they are interacting with VA.gov and attempt to complete tasks given by the moderator.

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
50% women, 50% men.
50% people who identify as an ethnicity/race other Caucasian.
A mix of educational background. 
A mix of tech experience / tech savviness.
At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55.
At least 1 participant without a college degree.
