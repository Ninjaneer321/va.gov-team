# Research Plan for Higher Level Review (HLR) Post Launch Usability Testing

## Goals
To understand potential usability issues and/or friction points that exist in the current deployed HLR designs.
To understand how users comprehend the language within the HLR process (i.e. legacy appeal, opt-out, etc)
To identify any confusing/ambiguous steps in the flow of the HLR submission process.

### Background
During roll out of HLR, we identified a couple of areas we can continue to interate on for usability changes.

### Research questions
Ideas for future usability:

1. Could we actually put the office where the review was conducted as part of the "other office" checkbox.
2. Can we display the decision date for contestable issues?
3. Do we want to display the name of the veteran on the review page.

### Hypotheses
- There are languages and terms in the flow that may confuse veterans (i.e. legacy appeals, opt-out, etc).
- Other office could still be imoproved to make it clear it would be a more senior person within the same office.

### Method
- We have previously conducted moderated usability testing sessions for the initial iteration of the designs and have gained feedback.
- We will be using remote, moderated usability studies because we need to talk to Veterans to understand what usability issues have been solved and which issues exist within the latest HLR designs. 
- We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.  
- We will ask Veterans to navigate to an Invision link (provided in the Zoom chat) and share their screens with us via Zoom.


## Participants
- 10 Veterans
- Must have filed a disability claim
- Variation in: age, location, experience with VA claims, tech savviness. 
- Must be able to describe to the researcher what they are trying to accomplish, what they are experiencing and thinking as they move through the prototype. 

## Recruitment
We will work with Perigean for recruiting. 

## When? 
1.	Timeline for usability testing: XXX
2.	Prepare: We're using an Invision prototype
3.  Length of Sessions: 55 minutes
4.	Availability: 11 am - 5 pm ET
5.	Pilot: Jan 14, 2020
