# Research Plan Spin-Up Questions

## Questions about AMA implementation, forms, and workflows

### Veterans

_Goal: Develop articulable insights into why and how a Veteran would use a self-service facility for decision review requests_

#### Statistics and metrics

- How many of each kind of form have been submitted?
- How many forms are self service vs representation?

#### Knowledge and motivation

- Why does a Veteran seek representation, and why do they go self service?
- How much research do they do before self service, and where do they do it? What are they reading and learning from?
- What does a veteran receive in the mail? What does it look like and what does it instruct them to do?
- Does the Veteran understand the VA/ AMA structure? Do they understand benefit types? Do they understand the 3 lanes? Do they know the difference between BVA, VBA, NCA, VHA?

### Case Workers (Claims Assistants, et al)

- How do they process cases that come in via fax? What is the step by step workflow?
- What percentage of issues written by the claimant are good, and what percentage need further development?
- Where are their biggest problems and bottlenecks? Wish list items?

### VSOs 

- How do VSOs regard self-service portals? 
  - One working theory is that it frees up their resources to work with the Veterans who need it most -- is this true?
  
### Business Lines

- How many AMA DRRs have the LOBs received? 
- Have they been able to process any of them successfully in Caseflow?
- What might a Caseflow digital submission review screen look like for LOBs? Are there any LOB-specific factors to consider?

### Systems

- Get a solid understanding of the claims flows/ systems, to make sure we're extending affordances where we can.
- What kind of issue data is in VBMS? Does it make sense to people?

## Cohorts

- Veterans who have submitted AMA decision review requests (3-5)
- VSO officials (2-3)
- Case workers (contextual observation, 1-3 hours)
- LOB interviews (1 each x 8 LOBs)
