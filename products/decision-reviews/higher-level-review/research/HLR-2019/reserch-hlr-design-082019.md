# Research Plan for Appeals’ Decision Review, 8/21 to 8/28 

### Gathering user feedback ofr our MVP design flow of a Decision Request on VA.gov.
There are many ways to translate the requirements of the Higher-Level Review paper form to a widget, we chose a user flow that:

- Uses issues as the building blocks or an appeal request.

- Reuses veteran data already in our systems and screens existing the VA.gov Benefits’ Application.

And, would like to get some initial user feedback before any development of these screens.


### Goals
1.	To gather user feedback on our MVP design flow for a veteran to requesting a Higher-Level Review on VA.gov. 


2.	Questions we hope to answers to with this user feedback sessions:
>
-  Is the proposed widget easy to use?
-  Is the proposed widget easy to navigate?
-  Do Veterans feel confident they can successfully request a HLR using this tool?
-  Is the instructional language clear?

Note: There may be other things about the MVP design we would like to learn about while presenting our prototype to our users – the final script will include all of our questions.

3. Test our hypothesis: Veterans logged in to VA.gov can understand how to navigate this Higher Level Review request widget and successfully complete their appeal using this tool.

### Method
-  Remote usability testing with low fidelity screens – Using a click-through Invision prototype.
By putting this prototype in front of users we can simulate the UI of VA.gov without much effort or development time. 
This methodology will help us gather the right feedback early in the design process.

-  We will conduct this research remotely by scheduling zoom desktop calls.

### Participants 
As many veterans we can talk to that fit the following criteria. Ideally 10 – 12 participants.

-  We want to review our initial MVP designs with Veterans wanting to request a Higher-Level Review. We can also talk to Veterans requesting a Decision Review or Supplemental Claim.

-  We want to have a diverse group of Veterans, from different parts of the country, different age groups, gender identity, ethnic background, education level, age groups and socioeconomic status. 


### Timeline
- **Timeline:** Flexible but preferably the week of 8/21 to 8/28.

- **Prepare:** We will prepare for the calls on August 19 and 20th. We can test out all the tools and do a prep review of the script.

- **Length of Sessions:** 45 minutes

- **Availability:** 9am - 7pm West Coast Time
