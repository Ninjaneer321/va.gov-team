# Decision Reviews Decision Log

## Decision Log

This Decision Log is used to record details of important decisions made throughout the life of the project. A decision log can provide quick and easy access to specific details about decisions made in the past if questions come up afterward.

Not every decision a project makes gets recorded in the Decision Log. When to include an item in the log involves striking a balance between what is valuable to have recorded versus what is too detailed. An entry should be recorded here in the following types of scenarios:

When a decision has a large impact on the direction/timeline/scope/cost of the project.
When multiple alternative options are considered and we want to keep a record of why we settled on the chosen option.
For decisions that may be confusing or not clear to all stakeholders.
For decisions that impact the what or how we achieve a deliverable/milestone, especially when that differs to stakeholder expectations. 
For decisions that may not seem significant but have the potential to cause issues if not understood.



| Date | Decision Title | Summary | Decision & Reasoning | Made By | Status
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|11.25.24 |5103 Question | Maintain required question with small addition | Maintain how it is now with updating the checkbox acknowledgment. We will update the field to drop the required label once LH updates the field's required property after Appeals API is transitioned. This is due to:
-the fact this question has already been in Prod up to this point
-LH can't currently update the field while on the DR API (I can double confirm this in my next LH mtg)
-the can of worms in making the decision to remove the field altogether for some Vets | Amy, Maurice | Resolved
