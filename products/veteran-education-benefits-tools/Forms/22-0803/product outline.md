## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

*Currently available as a PDF-only download, the 22-0803 form is used for reimbursement for license and certification test fees.  Digitizing the form will increase VA efficiencies and streamline and enhance the overall user experience.*

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*
*How might we streamline and digitize the Request for Reimbursement of Licensing or Certification Test Fees form to allow Veterans to submit their request for reimbursement? 

Who: Veterans and beneficiaries 

What: The current Request for Reimbursement of Licensing or Certification Test Fees form exists as a PDF, which limits accessibility and convenience.

Why: By digitizing the form, we can remove barriers to entry, making it easier for users to submit their forms. This will help improve the reimbursement process. 

Where: The current form is not accessible, restricting potential users who prefer or need a digital solution. Making the form available online will ensure broader and more convenient access.
