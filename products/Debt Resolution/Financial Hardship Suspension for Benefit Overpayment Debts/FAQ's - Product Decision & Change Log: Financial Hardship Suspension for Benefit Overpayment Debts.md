- **Question**
  - Answer
- **What are the different requirements for VBA? For VHA? The [current PDF form](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-10-10hs/) states it is under VHA. Is this correct? Is there another PDF form under VBA?**

- **Questions on 10-10HS:**
  - HOUSEHOLD INCOME (Includes gross income from employment,
net income from farm or ranch, and other income amounts.)
  - DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES (Includes non-reimbursed medical
expenses paid by you or your spouse, funeral and burial expenses
and expenses for the veteran's education.)
**For Veterans to answer these questions, will they need to answer every section within the income and expenses section of the FSR? Or can it be simplified?**
