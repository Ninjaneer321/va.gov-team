## Canary/QA Tests

**Objective**

The team is hosting canary/QA tests with Veterans who have active VBA overpayment debts. 

These tests will allow our researchers, designers, and engineers to preview the environment before it goes live. 

Sessions:

 Veteran previewed environment, form not submitted
 - [ ] Session 2
 - [ ] Session 3

## *Recruitment Request*

2-3 Veterans who have an  **active**  VBA overpayment debt on their account (not the same as a copay bill)

Please confirm that they are comfortable with signing in to their personal [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) account and sharing their email address login with our engineer who will be on the call

Please confirm that they are comfortable submitting the digital dispute form, knowing that we will delete their submission after the call

Note to Perigean: Please ask the Veteran to verify this before the session by logging in to their account: ​​[https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/)

An active debt will look like this on their account (taken from mock data):

## *Conversation guide*

**Hello/Welcome, introduction, informed consent**

Thank you so much for your time today. My name is Charlotte and I work at [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) as a consultant - it’s nice to meet you! I’ll be hosting this interview today.

How are you today?

I work at VA.gov to help improve access to benefits and services for Veterans like you and today we’d like your help for a walkthrough on the debt portal to verify that a new feature that is going live looks as expected.

I want to let you know that our call with you today is not going to be recorded.

I’d like to introduce one of our engineers on the call who will be on the call and asking you questions as well – Andrew. I’d also like to introduce one of our designers on the call who will be on the call and asking you questions as well – Megan.

This is not a research study and we will not be asking for feedback on the experience, we just want to make sure everything looks as expected.

We will be asking you to do a walk-through of a form to dispute your debt

We will delete the submission the end of the day of our session with you today.

Is this something you are comfortable with? [ask for informed consent]

**A few questions:**

- What email do you use to login? (if not shared previously)

[Share link to the digital dispute form – take through experience, verify all UI elements work, actions work as intended, error messages also work]

Asking Veterans to clearly write in the reason for dispute page:

-   **_On [Date of QA test and time] this form was submitted during a QA (quality assurance test) on behalf of a VA consulting team_**

Thank you for your time today!
