#  Research  Plan  for  [Financial Management Team,  Wizard (intro pages) and Digital Dispute Form,  May 2025]


## Background üèóÔ∏è Briefly describe the background of your product.

### ‚ÄòWizard‚Äô (formerly Wizard, now intro pages that orient the Veteran: Manage VA Debt page, ‚ÄúOptions to request help with VA debt‚Äù R&S page (‚ÄúWizard‚Äù), FSR intro page)

As of most recently, OCTO Content Team have opted for a static R&S page describing different financial help option within content nested in an accordion. This new approach reduces the need for Veterans to click through different pages and reduces cognitive load. 

### Digital Dispute Form

If a Veteran has a VA debt that they would like to dispute there is currently no formalized process for them to follow. Disputes can currently be submitted in a variety of formats (verbal, written, etc.) and the information required is not clearly defined. This experience can be confusing for Veterans and inefficient as additional information may need to be collected from the Veteran for the VA to process the dispute effectively.

-   Ability to dispute either the existence or amount of a VA Debt
    
-   Easy access to user-friendly process with clear instructions and minimal and simple input required from user.
    
-   Clear understanding of timelines and next steps in the dispute process
    
-   Ability to submit a written statement to present their individual situation and reasoning for disputing the debt.
    
-   Receives an email confirmation of their debt dispute submission.
     

## [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md)

Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

This research supports these main [OCTO objectives and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

 
1.  Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
    
2.  Veterans can manage their health services online
    
3.  Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
    
4.  Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features ***
    
5.  Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
    

#### This research supports increasing these measures:

Objective 1: VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

-   Key Result 1: Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
    
-   Key Result 2: We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
    

Objective 2: OCTO‚Äôs platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.

-   Key Result 4: Each of our platforms* and tools increase the number of non-OCTO built capabilities or non-OCTO users by 50%. (*excluding mobile)
    

  

-   Usage of digital, self- service tools
    
-   Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)
    
-   Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population
    

-   These users are segmented by Veteran OR non-Veteran and by Level of Assurance (LoA).
    
-   ‚ÄúTotal Veteran population‚Äù is the current count of living Veterans.
    

-   Completion rate of online transactions
    
-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov
    
-   Benefit value (in $) delivered from online applications or transactions
    

  

#### This research supports decreasing these measures:

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
    
-   Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery
    
-   Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
    
-   Time to process online applications (vs. paper)
    

  

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter?


Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
   
  

## Research Goals ü•Ö

What are you trying to learn from this research?
  

### The purpose of this research is to find out:

1.  ## Navigation, Wayfinding, & Mental Models
    
2.  ## Usability & Comprehension
    

### As a unified, connected experience: 

### 1. Navigation, wayfinding, preexisting mental models

-   How do Veterans navigate and find information in the intro pages all the way to the digital dispute form?
    
-   How do their preexisting mental models inform their experience navigating?
    

### As distinct products:

### 2. Usability & Comprehension

#### ‚ÄúWizard‚Äù / intro page and R&S page

-   How easily can Veterans navigate and find information that pertains to their debt or copay situation?
    
-   How helpful is the information shared which describes options for their situation?
    

-   Do they understand the paths available to them and the actions they need to take based on the information provided in the wizard?
    
-   What mental models do Veterans have around the resolution options as they pertain to their unique situation?
    

#### Digital Dispute

  [in progress]

### 3. Mental Models: How helpful is the information provided based on their prior knowledge and experiences, if any?

  
## Outcome

How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

   [in progress]


## Research questions


Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:

What will I do with what I learn from this question?

Does this question serve the goals of my study?


1.  Understand baseline: What experience, if any, do Veterans have with seeking debt relief and contesting VBA/VHA charges? What channels have they used to understand what they need to do?
    
2.  How easy is it for them to understand what they need to do through the information supplied in the Wizard in contrast to what they have done previously?
    
3.  How easy is it for Veterans to navigate the Manage VA Debt page, ‚ÄúOptions to request help with VA debt‚Äù R&S page (‚ÄúWizard‚Äù), FSR intro page, Digital Dispute form debt portal, from the intro pages all the way to finding the information they need?
    
4.  How easy is it for Veterans to find the digital dispute form? (findability)
    

1.  Given that there are 2 paths Veterans can take to find the dispute form, which one do most Veterans take to find the dispute form? (this will be a task, and we will measure time on task)
    

6.  How easy is it for Veterans using screen readers to navigate through the debt portal?
   

7.  How understandable is the information on the ‚ÄúOptions to request help with VA debt‚Äù R&S page? ?
    
8.  For the corresponding links (appeals), how clear and understandable is the content? *



## Hypothesis

Note: Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?
What do you already know about this problem space?
What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don‚Äôt skip this step!)
Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.
