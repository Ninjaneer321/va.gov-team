## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to find out:

**As a unified, connected experience:**

### 1. Navigation, wayfinding, preexisting mental models

  

- How do Veterans navigate and find information in the intro pages all the way to the digital dispute form?

  

- How do their preexisting mental models inform their experience navigating?

  

**As distinct products:**

### 2. Usability & Comprehension

*“Wizard” / intro page and R&S page*

  
- How easily can Veterans navigate and find information that pertains to their debt situation?

  

- To what extent does the provided information regarding options for their situation prove helpful?

  

- Do they understand the paths available to them and the actions they need to take based on the information provided in the wizard?

  

- What mental models do Veterans have around the resolution options as they pertain to their unique situation?

  

*Digital Dispute*

  

- How easily can Veterans understand the option of digital dispute based on how it is explained on R&S page and in the form?

  

- How easily can Veterans navigate the form?

  

- What, if any concerns are there?

  

### 3. Mental Models: How helpful is the information provided based on their prior knowledge and experiences, if any?

## Research Questions

1.  Understand baseline & mental models: What experience, if any, do Veterans have with seeking debt relief and contesting VBA charges? What channels have they used to understand what they need to do? How easy is it for them to understand what they need to do through the information supplied in the 'Wizard' (R&S page) in contrast to what they have done previously?
    

  

2.  Understand Navigation & Wayfinding: How easy is it for Veterans to navigate the Manage VA Debt page, “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page (“Wizard”), FSR intro page, Digital Dispute form debt portal, from the intro pages all the way to finding the information they need?
    

  

3.  Measuring: time to complete tasks, error rates
    

  

4.  Understand Findability & Wayfinding: How easy is it for Veterans to find the digital dispute form? (findability)
    

  

5.  Measuring: time to complete tasks
    

  

6.  Understand Findability & Wayfinding: Given that there are 2 paths Veterans can take to find the dispute form, which one do most Veterans take to find the dispute form? (this will be a task, and we will measure time on task)
    

  

7.  Understand Comprehension: How understandable is the information on the “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page?
    

  

8.  Understand Usability & Comprehension: How is navigation and understanding of the Digital Dispute form itself?
    

  

9.  Understand Navigation & Accessibility: How easy is it for Veterans using screen readers to navigate through the pages from intro pages to Digital Dispute form?
    

## Methodology

### Usability study

  

Primary focus: on navigation, wayfinding, mental models

  

Secondary focus: comprehension and mental models

### Location

  

We conducted hour-long (75 minutes for participants who utilized screen readers) remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on May 14–27, 2025.

  

Participants interacted with a prototype built on CodeSandbox: [https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt](https://zyc78g.csb.app/manage-va-debt)

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

List hypotheses explored in the research and the conclusions drawn. If applicable, list the success or task completion rate.

Tip

Place true or false statements in bold for easier scanability

-   Hypothesis Statement: [Insert statement]
    

-   "Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”
    
-   Supporting evidence
    

[Example Hypotheses and Conclusions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)

"Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”)

1.  Veterans (users in this study) may struggle to find the new “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page (“Wizard”) and may have difficulty noticing the difference between this new page and other help/intro pages such as: Manage VA Debt page and FSR intro page:
    

**Likely false**

2.  Veterans will find the information on the 3 help/intro pages (Manage VA Debt page and FSR intro page) including the R&S page to be helpful:
    

**Likely true: helpful overall, some detail missing on R&S page**

3.  Veterans will be able to find the Digital Dispute form easily so long as they are able to find the R&S page:
    
**Likely true: some participants found the Dispute Form on the Manage VA Debt page**

4.  Veterans will view the experience of introductory pages to Digital Dispute form as part of one experience:

**Definitely true:** **the experience felt cohesive; no one commented on it feeling disconnected, likely due to the recurring content across different pages that created a sense of carryover**

5.  Veterans will be able to understand the Digital Dispute Form easily and without significant cognitive load demands:
    

**Definitely true**

6.  Veterans will be able to navigate through the Digital Dispute Form easily:
    

**Definitely true**

7.  Veterans (users in this study) may find an option to resolve or address their debt on the “Options to request help with VA debt” R&S page (“Wizard”) that is relevant to them and it may take them time to understand and find the option that is most relevant to them:
    

**Maybe true** 

 
## Key Findings

Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.

  
[Example Key Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)

  

### 1. Usability of the Debt Portal as a connected experience:

> #### Overall, navigation and findability in the debt portal were excellent, regardless of prior familiarity with the debt portal interface. Participants understood the design elements on each page, they navigated between pages easily, and they found information easily.

### 2. Usability of the Resources & Support page: navigation and content architecture were intuitive

  
> #### Overall, participants found the Resources & Support page easy to navigate, and they liked that all of the information needed to seek resolution was on one page. The overall page hierarchy was intuitive to participants. All participants expanded the accordion with no issues, and a few stated that they liked the use of accordions on the page.

### 3. Overall, the ‘Disability compensation, pension, and GI Bill benefits’ section received mixed feedback.


>#### Some sections were described as clear and helpful, while others sections were described as too vague to be useful or actionable. Findability of the dispute form was tested in this study, and participants could find this section easily. However, this option did not always apply to their situation.

  
 

### 4. Helpfulness and actionability of '[Rogers STEM Scholarship,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#rogers-stem-scholarship) [VET TEC program](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#vet-tec-program), [Separation pay,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#separation-pay) [Attorney fees](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#attorney-fees)' section

>#### These section titles and the information under these sections: [Rogers STEM Scholarship,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#rogers-stem-scholarship) [VET TEC program](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#vet-tec-program), [Separation pay,](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#separation-pay) [Attorney fees](https://zyc78g.csb.app/help-options#attorney-fees) were too vague for participants to understand. They did not always make the connection between the section titles and the purpose of the page (find other ways to request help with other debts). The information underneath them was also too vague.


### 5. The Dispute Form was easy and straightforward and participants had suggestions of features or improvements that could be added.

### 6. Service Design Findings (mental models and past experiences resolving VBA overpayment debts - baseline): most participants described long, frustrating, experiences in attempting to resolve overpayments.
