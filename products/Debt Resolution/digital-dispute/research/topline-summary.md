This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings

## Initial Findings


### R&S page: Options to request help with VA debt


**Finding 1: Overall Usability**


- Overall participants found the Resources & Support page easy to navigate, and they liked that all of the information needed was on one page. 
    
- All participants expanded the accordion with no issues. 
    
- The 2 screen reader users we interviewed expanded the accordion with no issues as well. 


**Finding 2: Comprehension**

We identified a few improvements to begin thinking about:

**Disability compensation, pension, and GI Bill benefits**


- The wording on the headers of the accordion for the FSR Repayment plan 'more than 5 years' and 'less than 5 years'  was confusing to a few participants: 


The point of confusion for a few participants was the following: 

- Is it referring to an overpayment debt that happened more than  5 years ago/ less than 5 years ago OR is it referring to the repayment plan extended over more than 5 years / less than 5 years?

- Participants interpreted both in these interviews.
        

**Finding 3: Some sections on R&S page were too vague:**

**Rogers STEM Scholarship, VET TEC program, Separation pay, Attorney fees**


- Some participants found the content on certain sections of the R&S page were too vague to understand. 
- Several participants were confused by these header titles (heading 2), not having experienced these types of debt before, and a few assumed or questioned if these were actions they could take for their debt, such as hiring an attorney.
  
> "VA doesn't pay attorney fees, wait, do they?" -P18


Recommendation or solution: 

- Add the word "debt" next to every section title for additional clarity
- Adding more context under the section titles for clarity



### Dispute Form 

**Finding 4: The Dispute Form was easy and straightforward**

- Some participants mentioned they would like to see an example statement to know what information to provide in the open text field on the form.
- Some participants mentioned they would like an option to edit the information on the Review Page.
- Some participants mentioned they would like a way to upload important documents.
