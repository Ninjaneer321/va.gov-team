# ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ Intro

Thank you so much for joining today. My name is Emily, and [NAME] here will be taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the digital waiting room who would like to observe, but we‚Äôll get to that momentarily.

Today, we‚Äôll be discussing how people think about and manage certain financial items. We'll be going over debt from VA benefit overpayments and VA medical copays. I'd like to check in first ‚Äì are you comfortable dicussing these topics?

Before we start, I have a few logistics to cover:



* I have [number] colleagues who are interested in observing this session to better understand the Veteran experience. Would you be okay with them observing?
    * _If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
    * _If yes: Admit observers._
* _(after all observers have entered)_ I'm going to have all our observers turn on cameras if you're able and do a very brief intro so that you know who all is here. _(call on everyone individually - have them say first name and position at VA)_
* _(after intros are done)_ Thanks all! You can go ahead and mute yourselves and turn off your cameras.
<br></br>
* This will take about 60 minutes. Because I want to keep us on time, I may occasionally prompt you to the next topic.
* We want your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers, and we‚Äôre not testing anything of you. I will not be offended by any opinions you share.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* I‚Äôll be having you work with a prototype for part of today. It may look and act like the real app and website, but it‚Äôs only a demo tool and therefore lots of elements will not be working. You will not be logged into your account, so nothing you do will affect your benefits or anything else in your account.
* Were you able to download the mobile app Figma?
    * _(if Yes)_: Great, thank you. I‚Äôll be walking you through signing in with a test account later, and this is how you‚Äôll view the prototype.
    * _(if No)_ : no problem. Do you recall specific issues you were having? _(don‚Äôt spend too much time troubleshooting)_
    * _(if they don‚Äôt have Figma - note that they‚Äôll be viewing the responsive prototype)_
<br></br>
* If you would be okay with it, we would like to record this session today, but let me explain things first before you consent. 
    * The purpose is to assure that we capture your opinions accurately. Your name and other identifying information will never be used when reporting on this project ‚Äì for example we assign you a participant ID (such as P7) if quoting you. And after we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed.
    * Knowing this, are you comfortable with me recording the session?
    * And also, it can sometimes be helpful to share video clips from sessions to our VA partners so they can better understand the experiences of Veterans. In these clips, we blur out anything that could identify you ‚Äì your profile photo for example ‚Äì and they would only be shared among VA partners. I will also ask at the end of this session so that you could veto, but knowing this, would you be comfortable with us potentially using a clip from this session?
    * _(if yes)_ I‚Äôm going to start the recording, and once I do I‚Äôm going to confirm once more that you‚Äôre okay with the recording.
<br></br>

‚è∫Ô∏è Start recording.
<br></br>
> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

* Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing

That's all for today. Thank you so much for taking the time to share your thoughts with us. It's so helpful to be able to speak directly with Veterans to learn about their experiences, and ultimately build digital products that will be useful.

Perigean will be reaching out and sending you a thank you note.

Thank you so much, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
