## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

The integration of Pay.gov Hosted Collection Pages aims to provide an easier, more seamless payment experience for Veterans. In the current experience, Veterans are redirected from the VA.gov “Resolve Overpayment” page to an external pay.va.gov tab and entry page, where they must manually enter their personal account information. Monthly Medallia feedback consistently describes this experience as confusing and painful, increasing cognitive load and leading to drop-off.  

The new design streamlines the user experience with Pay.gov hosted collection pages, presenting the VA.gov to Pay.gov payment journey as a continuous flow and prepopulating a user’s account information, thus removing the need for Veterans to manually enter debt information.
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

The new experience spans VA.gov auth pages with Pay.gov Hosted Collection Pages integration. When looking at an individual overpayment debt , the user will be able to select full, partial, or a payment plan within VA.gov, and then proceed to Pay.gov hosted collection pages within the same browser without having to reenter their account information. Next, they enter and review payment information, and finally arrive at a payment confirmation page on VA.gov
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**[Enter answer here]**

As described above, this iterates and improves upon the existing payment journey, to now include the ability to seamlessly process a payment for an overpayment debt directly from the va.gov experience without needing to navigate to a different site.

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

> [!NOTE]
> Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

### Goals

`1.` **[Understand Veterans’ needs, expectations, and preferences for making payments]**

`2.` **[Test the usability of the Veteran’s overpayment debt experience in viewing and selecting full or partial payment]**
  
### Outcomes
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---
* Determine how to iterate [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) pages to improve the payment experience for Veterans prior to build and release  
* Advance user-centered digital strategy for delivering future payment features and functionality  
* Gain foundational understanding of Veteran payment needs and preferred methods  
* Decrease rate of drop off due to Veteran frustration with manual data entry   
* Increase online payment transactions and decrease analog payment transactions  
* Increase Veteran confidence that payment has been received

---

### Research questions
> [!NOTE]
> Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the` [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)

***Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:***
	
`What will I do with what I learn from this question?`
  
`Does this question serve the goals of my study?`

**`1.`[What are Veterans’ current workflows and mental models for making payments on VA.gov?]**

**`2.`[What other comparable payment experiences do they prefer? Why?]**

**`3.`[What challenges or pain points do Veterans encounter in the current experience?]**

**`4.`[How easy is it to read and comprehend the pages?]**

**`5.`[Which aspects of the layout are most and least effective and why?]**

**`6.`[How does the experience compare to what they expected?]**

**`7.`[How confident and secure do they feel in the payment process?]**

> [!TIP]
>Enter more questions as needed

### Hypotheses
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to constrain the hypotheses to the goals of your study!
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

---

**[* Veterans will prefer the more streamlined experience of hosted collection pages, including pre-populated account details and staying within the same browser  
* Veterans will not have difficulty deciding whether to make a partial or full payment  
* Veterans will feel confident and secure that their payment has has been received in the new experience  
* Veterans will want more diverse payment methods for submitting payments, including recurring payments]**

## Recruitment 🎯	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 
- Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
- Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and download the [recruitment checker (Excel)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/digital-experience/accessibility/research/RecruitmentCheckerSpreadsheet.xlsx) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity and use it to plan your participant demographics for this study.

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
- Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
- Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:

> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[TBD MM/DD HH:MM]**

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[75 minutes for non-AT users, 
140 minutes for AT users]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[60 mins]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[2 per day]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
