# **Intro (7 minutes)**

* Thank you so much for joining today. My name is Risha, and \[NAME\] here will be taking notes.  
* Today, we’ll be discussing how people think about and manage payments. I’ll ask you some questions about your experiences making payments with the VA and other institutions. Then I’ll share a prototype of a part of the website we’re currently working on and ask for your feedback. How does that sound?  
* I work for the VA. My goal today is to get a sense of how you want to manage your VA finances, and how our tools can support that. I want you to know up front that I won't be able to solve issues for you right now – I don't have any access to your records, nor any direct contact with billing and debt departments. I do want to know about your frustrations in case there are things we can improve in the future.  
* I have \[number\] colleagues who are interested in observing this session to better understand the Veteran experience. Would you be okay with them observing?  
  * *If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.*  
  * *If yes: Admit observers.*  
* This interview will take about 75 minutes. Because I want to keep us on time, I may occasionally prompt you to the next topic.  
* You are the expert, and we want your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers, and we’re not testing anything of you. I will not be offended by any opinions you share.  
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.  
* Finally, I would like to confirm you are comfortable with my recording this session. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable if I record our session today?  
* And also, it can be helpful to share video clips from sessions to our VA partners so they can better understand the experiences of Veterans. In these clips, we blur out anything that could identify you – your profile photo for example – and they would only be shared among VA partners. Would you be comfortable with us potentially using a clip from this session?  
* *(if yes)* I’m going to start the recording, and once I do I’m going to confirm once more that you’re okay with the recording.

⏺️ Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?  
* Do you have any questions before we get started?

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to SHOW CAPTIONS \> View Full Transcript \> Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking Close Full Transcript in the Show Captions menu.*

# **Screen sharing instructions (if needed)**

* In the Zoom application on your computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says Share *(on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click More...)*  
  * If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.  
  * (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)  
* Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says Share. Then there will be options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.  
* Great, now I can see your screen\! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

# **Warm-up (3 minutes)**

* My first question is to get to know you a little. What is a recent hobby or interest?

# **Payment behaviors (25 minutes)**

* Switching gears to talk about your experience with the VA. I’d like to ask you some questions about how you make payments. I want to make sure that you’re only sharing what you’re willing to share.  
* Tell me about the last time you paid a bill to the VA.  
  * How did you do it?  
  * What was easy? What was frustrating?  
* What would have made that experience easier?  
* Think about a recent payment you made that felt easier?   
  * Tell me about that experience. What made it easier than the VA?  
* Have you ever been on a payment plan with the VA?  
  * Tell me about that experience. How did you set it up?  
  * How did you decide on the amount and timeline?  
  * What was easy? What was difficult?  
  * Would you do anything differently next time?  
* How did that compare to a payment plan outside the VA, if you’ve had one?

\[Moderator’s note: ask if participant says they haven’t been on a VA payment plan\]

* Have you ever been on a payment plan outside of the VA?  
  * Tell me about that experience. How did you set it up?  
  * How did you decide on the amount and timeline?  
  * What was easy? What was difficult?  
  * Would you do anything differently next time?  
* Have you ever considered setting up automatic payments for any of your debts?  
  * \[IF YES\] What made you decide to set that up? How did you go about setting that up?  
  * \[IF NO\] What made you decide against it?  
* Let me ask you a bit about how you manage your finances in general. How do you track and manage your finances?  
  * What information matters most for you when you’re paying bills?  
  * Do you use any tools to track and manage your finances?  
  * How do you make sure you have enough money in your account when payments are due?  
  * What makes you feel secure when making a payment?

# **Prototype section (30 min)**

## **Setup and Introduction (2 min)**

* Now we’ll switch gears and I’ll ask for your feedback on a part of the website we’re working on.  
* You'll be interacting with a prototype that may not work exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not.  
* None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.  
* We would like to hear your honest feedback. As much as possible please think out loud so that we can understand what is going through your mind when you use the prototype. That will help us to make improvements to it.

## **Task 0: Launch prototype (2 minutes)**

* I am going to drop a link in the Zoom chat. When you receive the link, please click it.

* Now I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your own screen, so if you'd like to close anything that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.
