# Intro (7 minutes)

* Thank you so much for joining today. My name is Risha, and \[NAME\] here will be taking notes.

* (if applicable) [accessibility specialist] is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology during this session.

* Today, we’ll be discussing how people think about and manage payments. I’ll ask you some questions about your experiences making payments with the VA and other institutions. Then I’ll share a prototype of a part of the website we’re currently working on and ask for your feedback. How does that sound? 

* I work for the VA. My goal today is to get a sense of how you want to manage your VA finances, and how our tools can support that. I want you to know up front that I won't be able to solve issues for you right now – I don't have any access to your records, nor any direct contact with billing and debt departments. I do want to know about your frustrations in case there are things we can improve in the future.

* I have \[number\] colleagues who are interested in observing this session to better understand the Veteran experience. Would you be okay with them observing?  
  * *If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.*  
  * *If yes: Admit observers.*  
* This interview will take about 75 minutes [For AT Users - 90 minutes]. Because I want to keep us on time, I may occasionally prompt you to the next topic.

* You are the expert, and we want your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers, and we’re not testing anything of you. I will not be offended by any opinions you share.

* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

* Finally, I would like to confirm you are comfortable with my recording this session. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. **Are you comfortable if I record our session today?**

* *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

* If you would be okay with it, we would like to record this session today, but let me explain things first before you consent.

* And also, it can be helpful to share video clips from sessions to our VA partners so they can better understand the experiences of Veterans. In these clips, we blur out anything that could identify you – your profile photo for example – and they would only be shared among VA partners. Would you be comfortable with us potentially using a clip from this session?

* *(if yes)* I’m going to start the recording, and once I do I’m going to confirm once more that you’re okay with the recording.

⏺️ Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

* Do you have any questions before we get started?

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to SHOW CAPTIONS \> View Full Transcript \> Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking Close Full Transcript in the Show Captions menu.*

# Screen sharing instructions (if needed)

* In the Zoom application on your computer, there's a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a button that says Share *(on phone, may need to scroll sideways or click More...)*  
  * If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.  
  * (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)  
* Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the button that says Share. Then there will be options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.  
* Great, now I can see your screen\! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

# Troubleshooting

\[Avoid AI Companion, which is a new option next to “Share” in the Zoom buttons\]

\[If see unpredictable jumping around behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)\]

\[If having difficulty moving windows around or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant’s screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>’s screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.\]

\[If can't see an iPhone's magnified screen, ask participant to go into their phone and do `Settings > Accessibility > Show while Mirroring`\]

\[If “Uncaught runtime errors”, close with “X” (label “dismiss”) in top right corner, leave site if prompted.

Check my browser window to see if codespace shut down.

If so, restart it. Then have them click on the Apple button to resume/start over.\]

# Warm-up (3 minutes)

* My first question is to get to know you a little.  What is a recent hobby or interest?

## For only assistive tech users (5 minutes)

* **What assistive technology are you using right now? *(screen reader / magnifier \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_)***  
  * *(If Dolphin screen reader, won't be able to share screen on Zoom)*  
  * *(if no AT)* Do you sometimes use assistive technology while using VA.gov or filling out a form online?  
    * If so, what do you use and when?  
      * Would you be willing to start using it now in this session?  
      * *(if not, run session w/o AT, or stop and ask Perigean for a replacement participant)*  
* How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen *(reader / magnifier)*\--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?  
* How long have you been using a screen *(reader / magnifier)*?  
* Have you ever shared your screen in Zoom while using a screen *(reader / magnifier)*? *(Yes / No)*  
  * If not, we can help you do that.

# Payment behaviors (25 minutes)

* Switching gears to talk about your experience with the VA. I’d like to ask you some questions about how you make payments. I want to make sure that you’re only sharing what you’re willing to share.

* Tell me about the last time you paid a bill to the VA.   
  * How did you do it?  
  * What was easy? What was frustrating?

* What would have made that experience easier?  

* Think about a recent payment you made that felt easier \- maybe a bill to your bank, credit card company, or another organization.  
  * Tell me about that experience. What made it easier than the VA?

  * Do you use any apps, spreadsheets, or tools?  
  * How do you make sure you have enough money in your account when payments are due?  
  * What information do you need to feel confident making a payment?

* Have you ever been on a payment plan with the VA?  
  * Tell me about that experience. How did you set it up?  
  * How did you decide on the amount and timeline?  
  * What was easy? What was difficult?  
  * Would you do anything differently next time?

* How did that compare to a payment plan outside the VA, if you’ve had one?

\[Moderator’s note: ask if participant says they haven’t been on a VA payment plan\]

* Have you ever been on a payment plan outside of the VA?  
  * Tell me about that experience. How did you set it up?  
  * How did you decide on the amount and timeline?  
  * What was easy? What was difficult?  
  * Would you do anything differently next time?

* Have you ever considered setting up automatic payments for any of your debts?
