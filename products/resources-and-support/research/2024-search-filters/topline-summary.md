This topline summary provides a high-level overview of the initial trends observed in the research sessions. It is important to note that this document is not the final result of working with the data discovered. A deeper review and analysis of the data gathered may change the information in this document. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes 
  
## Introduction

The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the new filter design and functionality in the Resources & Support (R&S) section of VA.gov. 

## Participants

We talked to 12 participants in total. The breakdown of participants included:
 - 9 Veterans (4 were also a family member or caregiver)
 - 1 active service member
 - 2 family members or caregivers
 - Most (10 of 12) were able to share their screen and navigate the prototype on their own. 
 - Most (9 of 12) were from urban areas
 - Most (9 of 12) of the users used a smartphone during the session; 3 used a tablet.
 - Android users (2 of 12) were not able to enable the screenshare on zoom from their devices

## Preliminary Findings

### General
- Users employ different navigational options first based on their individual preferences and goals. The initial choice of navigational method depended on the participant's goal or task, familiarity with the site, or personal preferences.
- Users primarily navigated by browsing, with search as a secondary preference
- Most users did not engage with the filters or tags until explicitly prompted
- Users were generally able to find the information they were looking for
- Users expressed a desire to sign-in with the expectation that content would be customized for them
- Many users turn to third-party resources to find information about VA programs and services due to the challenges they face on the VA website

### Browse/Scroll
- Clear navigation links (Featured Links, Browse by Benefit & Common Topics) are appreciated for their efficiency, speed, readability, and prominence in the interface.
- Many participants initially scanned through the homepage looking for keywords and categories they were interested in
- “Browse by benefit” and “common topics” are distinct features, serving different purposes in helping users find information depending on the mode of their purpose. 
> "They should be featuring the common topics. That's what I'm here for....most common topics that people are looking for." 
> "I do like the fact that... you had those two groupings... common searches and then search by benefit.  I do really like the way that's put together... and then I don't have to try to figure out what am I looking for?"
  
### Search
- Searching is preferable for some participants as opposed to browsing categories when users have a specific information need, are in a rush, or are unsure where to find information.
- Previous experiences with search across VA.gov has affected how users perceive how the feature might work on the prototype. 
- Overall, user sentiment toward VA.gov search after the usability test sessions is mixed, with some appreciating the improvements made while others still experience frustration and find the search function difficult to use. Some of this could be the result of testing with a partially functional prototype site. 
- Many participants said the searches have gotten a lot better and it's easier to find information when you do searches
- Some participants mentioned reluctance to use search due to fears of getting stuck in loops

### Filters
- Most participants didn't notice or interact with the "Show filters" button initially
- Many participants had mixed reactions to the filter feature. Some found them helpful for narrowing down searches, while others were confused or unsure how to use them effectively
- Many users expressed confusion regarding the purpose and function of the filters, and initially were unclear how they were different from the tags
- Some participants felt the filters didn't actually filter anything. Others ran into dead ends or limited results when using them

### Tags
- Tags can potentially enhance site navigation, but the current implementation has some issues that may be preventing them from being more effective.
- The “tags” functionality on the prototype has several potential usability issues, with many users not understanding their purpose or finding them useful.
- Tags and filters both serve to help users narrow down and refine search results, but they differ in their functionality and user perception.
  
## Usability Issues

- Filters: Clarity and Functionality. Many participants were unclear on what the filters meant or how they functioned. 
- Some didn't understand the "Audience" filter, while others didn't know what "tags" were. 
- Some participants felt the filters didn't actually filter anything.This may be simply the limitation of the functional prototype.
- Tags: Usefulness. Some participants did not know what tags meant. Participants also expressed that clicking on the tags didn't take them to what they were looking for.
- Browse by Benefit Placement. One participant suggested that browse by benefit should come before the common topics because they are usually going in for a specific reason.
  
## Next Steps

- Synthesize data
- Write research report
