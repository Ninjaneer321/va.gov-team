This topline summary provides a high-level overview of the initial trends observed in the research sessions. It is important to note that this document is not the final result of working with the data discovered. A deeper review and analysis of the data gathered may change the information in this document. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes 
  
## Introduction

The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the new filter design and functionality in the Resources & Support (R&S) section of VA.gov. 

## Participants

We talked to 12 participants in total. The breakdown of participants included:
 - 9 Veterans (4 were also a family member or caregiver)
 - 1 active service member
 - 2 family members or caregivers
 - Most (10 of 12) were able to share their screen and navigate the prototype on their own. 
 - Most (9 of 12) were from urban areas
 - Most (9 of 12) of the users used a smartphone during the session; 3 used a tablet.
 - Android users (2 of 12) were not able to enable the screenshare on zoom from their devices

## Preliminary Findings

### General
- Users employ different navigational options first based on their individual preferences and goals. The initial choice of navigational method depended on the participant's goal or task, familiarity with the site, or personal preferences.
- Users primarily navigated by browsing, with search as a secondary preference

 > "I am going to look and see if there is anything already here. I see nothing there so I am going to have to go search for that." - P8

- Many users did not engage with the filters or tags until explicitly prompted

> "I don’t think I’d even see these to be honest" - P9

- Users were generally able to find the information they were looking for
- Users expressed a desire to sign-in with the expectation that content would be customized for them
- Many users turn to third-party resources to find information about VA programs and services due to the challenges they face on the VA website

### Browse/Scroll
- Clear navigation links are appreciated for their efficiency, speed, readability, and prominence in the interface.
- Many participants initially scanned through the homepage looking for keywords and categories they were interested in

> "They should be featuring the common topics. That's what I'm here for... most common topics that people are looking for." 

- “Browse by benefit” and “common topics” are distinct features, serving different purposes in helping users find information depending on the mode of their purpose. 

> "I do like the fact you had those two groupings... common searches and then search by benefit.  I do really like the way that's put together. I don't have to try to figure out 'what am I looking for?'"

  
### Search
- Searching is preferable for some participants as opposed to browsing categories when users have a specific information need, are in a rush, or are unsure where to find information.

> "The search took me to what I was looking for, but the tags didn’t. I would probably bypass the tags and just do a search." - P8

- Previous experiences with search across VA.gov has affected how users perceive how the feature might work on the prototype. 
- Overall, user sentiment toward VA.gov search after the usability test sessions is mixed, with some appreciating the improvements made while others still experience frustration and find the search function difficult to use. Some of this could be the result of testing with a partially functional prototype site. 
- Many participants said the searches have gotten a lot better and it's easier to find information when you do searches
- Some participants mentioned reluctance to use search due to fears of getting stuck in loops

### Filters
- Most participants didn't notice or interact with the "Show filters" button initially
- Many participants had mixed reactions to the filter feature. Some found them helpful for narrowing down searches, while others were confused or unsure how to use them effectively

> "Having gone through this now I would want to use the filters. That would help me really narrow down my search." - P8
> 
- Many users expressed confusion regarding the purpose and function of the filters, and initially were unclear how they were different from the tags
- Some participants felt the filters didn't actually filter anything. Others ran into dead ends or limited results when using them

>  "I thought we were narrowing it down but then it threw me off." - P13

### Tags
- Tags can potentially enhance site navigation, but the current implementation has some issues that may be preventing them from being more effective.

> "I’m not sure why it’s being shown. I’m not sure what it is. What I’m expected to do with it. If there’s not something I’m expected to do with it, I’m not sure why it pops up and you know clobbers that space." - P4

- The “tags” functionality on the prototype has several potential usability issues, with many users not understanding their purpose or finding them useful.

> "The filter I like, the tag, I don’t think it’s the right word, maybe topics or filters again" - P14

- Tags and filters both serve to help users narrow down and refine search results, but they differ in their functionality and user perception.


  
## Usability Issues

- Filters: Clarity and Functionality. Many participants were unclear on what the filters meant or how they functioned. 
- Some didn't understand the "Audience" filter, while others didn't know what "tags" were. 
- Some participants felt the filters didn't actually filter anything.This may be simply the limitation of the functional prototype.
- Tags: Usefulness. Some participants did not know what tags meant. Participants also expressed that clicking on the tags didn't take them to what they were looking for.
- Browse by Benefit Placement. One participant suggested that browse by benefit should come before the common topics because they are usually going in for a specific reason.
  
## Next Steps

- Synthesize data
- Write research report
