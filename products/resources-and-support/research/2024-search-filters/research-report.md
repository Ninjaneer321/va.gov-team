## Research Goals
The Resources & Support (R&S) section of VA.gov provides an unauthenticated, self-service library of targeted information to help Veterans and other beneficiaries understand their VA benefits. This research aims to evaluate how the new filter design and functionality supports discoverability and user understanding, especially with the anticipated growth of R&S content.

The goals of this research are to:

1. Utilize a Figma prototype to get user feedback on the new filter design and functionality to find information.
2. Understand which search, filtering, and browsing options users choose and in what order.
3. Learn if the labels and groupings of filters align with user mental models.

## Research Questions

1. Goal 1. Get user feedback on the new filter design and functionality to find information
   - Do users understand how to access the filter overlay modal?
   - Do users understand the and/or logic between filters across/within filter groups?
   - Do users understand the Apply filters, Clear all, and X buttons in filter overlay modal?
   - Do users understand how to dismiss a filter once it's applied?
   - Do users understand how the filter chips on results/detail pages (w/X) work vs. on the landing page (w/o X)?
2. Goal 2. Understand which of the search, filtering, and browsing options users choose to interact with and in what order
    - What do people do first—searching, filtering, or browsing?
        - Do people ever use filters before searching? Why or why not?
        - What do people do next?
3. Goal 3. Learn if the labels and groupings of filters align with user mental models
    - Do users understand the filter group meanings: Audience, Benefit, Topic?
    - Do users of each audience type choose the filter that aligns with them?
    - Do users understand the individual filter labels?
    - What search terms do users put in the search box?
    - How do search terms overlap with or differ from filter labels?
    - Are there other filters that users expect that are missing?
4. Other questions
    - Do users find the information they are looking for, regardless of which path they take to get there?
    - Do different user groups (Veterans, family members and caregivers, service members) have different outcomes?
    - Are there other factors (e.g., frequency ofVA.gov use, VA benefits received) that affect how easily users are able to find relevant information?
    - What are user expectations of the scope of R&S search vs. site-wide search?
    - What are users' previous experiences with searching/browsing for information on VA.gov?

## Methodology 

Using a [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/cg8VNnxFOxw7lb10FVHpi5/Resources-support?node-id=834-6977&p=f&t=4Al9acYZgonf0ncD-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=504%3A6304&starting-point-node-id=1014%3A7143&show-proto-sidebar=1&hotspot-hints=0&hide-ui=1) created by our Designer, Dave Pickett, we conducted 12 remote moderated usability testing over Zoom. 10 of the 12 participants were able to share their screen and navigate the prototype on their own. Two of the participants were unable to share their screen, but were able to proceed with the moderator sharing his screen.
