## Research Goals
The Resources & Support (R&S) section of VA.gov provides an unauthenticated, self-service library of targeted information to help Veterans and other beneficiaries understand their VA benefits. This research aims to evaluate how the new filter design and functionality supports discoverability and user understanding, especially with the anticipated growth of R&S content.

The goals of this research are to:

1. Utilize a Figma prototype to get user feedback on the new filter design and functionality to find information.
2. Understand which search, filtering, and browsing options users choose and in what order.
3. Learn if the labels and groupings of filters align with user mental models.

## Research Questions

1. Goal 1. Get user feedback on the new filter design and functionality to find information
   - Do users understand how to access the filter overlay modal?
   - Do users understand the and/or logic between filters across/within filter groups?
   - Do users understand the Apply filters, Clear all, and X buttons in filter overlay modal?
   - Do users understand how to dismiss a filter once it's applied?
   - Do users understand how the filter chips on results/detail pages (w/X) work vs. on the landing page (w/o X)?
2. Goal 2. Understand which of the search, filtering, and browsing options users choose to interact with and in what order
    - What do people do first—searching, filtering, or browsing?
        - Do people ever use filters before searching? Why or why not?
        - What do people do next?
3. Goal 3. Learn if the labels and groupings of filters align with user mental models
    - Do users understand the filter group meanings: Audience, Benefit, Topic?
    - Do users of each audience type choose the filter that aligns with them?
    - Do users understand the individual filter labels?
    - What search terms do users put in the search box?
    - How do search terms overlap with or differ from filter labels?
    - Are there other filters that users expect that are missing?
4. Other questions
    - Do users find the information they are looking for, regardless of which path they take to get there?
    - Do different user groups (Veterans, family members and caregivers, service members) have different outcomes?
    - Are there other factors (e.g., frequency ofVA.gov use, VA benefits received) that affect how easily users are able to find relevant information?
    - What are user expectations of the scope of R&S search vs. site-wide search?
    - What are users' previous experiences with searching/browsing for information on VA.gov?

## Methodology 

Using a [Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/cg8VNnxFOxw7lb10FVHpi5/Resources-support?node-id=834-6977&p=f&t=4Al9acYZgonf0ncD-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=504%3A6304&starting-point-node-id=1014%3A7143&show-proto-sidebar=1&hotspot-hints=0&hide-ui=1) created by our Designer, Dave Pickett, we conducted 12 remote moderated usability testing over Zoom. 10 of the 12 participants were able to share their screen and navigate the prototype on their own. Two of the participants were unable to share their screen, but were able to proceed with the moderator sharing his screen.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Users will understand the search, filtering, and browsing functionality available to them.
   - **Partially True:** All participants understood the browsing and search capabilities. Only a few participants engaged with the filter functionality without prompting. Most participants understood the filters once prompted. One area that caused confusion was the relationship between tags and filters.
2. Users will understand the labels of filters and filter groups.
   - **Mostly True:** Most participants seemed to understand many individual filter labels they encountered, and understood which ones were relevant to their tasks.
3. Users are able to find the information that they're looking for.
   - **Mostly True:** Most participants were able to find the information that they were looking for in most cases. Only 2/12 participants gave up on a task without locating a relevant article. 
    
## Key Findings

1. The majority of the participants (11/12) understood the specifics of the filter modal’s logic between filters across/within filter groups and functionality.
2. Almost all of the participants found the information they are looking for, regardless of which path they take to get there.
3. Most participants overlooked the Show Filters button and or the modal
4. A majority of  participants (7/12) expressed frustration of confusion related to tags
5. Half of the participants (6/12) experienced confusion and frustration with the filter chips functionality.
6. After initially experiencing some confusion, or not interacting with the feature, and with later questions/prompts from the moderator, the majority of participants understood how the filter chips on results/detail pages (w/X) work vs. on the landing page (w/o X).
7. Almost all of the participants (10/12) understood the filter group label meanings: Audience, Benefit, Topic, and chose a filter that aligned with their needs.

## Details of Findings 


### Finding 1 - Almost all participants found the information they were looking for via browsing or searching

- 10 of 12 participants were able to accomplish all tasks
- 2 participants gave up on at least one task
- 7 participants primarily navigated via browsing (with search as secondary)
- 4 participants primarily navigated via searching (with browsing as secondary)
- 1 participant primarily navigated via filtering (with browsing as secondary)

### Finding 2 - Only a few participants opened the filter modal without prompting

- Only 3 of 12 participants opened the filter modal without prompting by the moderator.
> “I see, show filters. So I might go to that... (opens the modal) Okay, so curious about filters. So audience filter by audience veterans, family members, caregivers, active service members...“ - P1
> “I was curious to see what the filters were for. How I might be able to tailor what I’m looking for.” - P9
> “I like that. It has a show, filters button. I can filter by what applies to me like, am I a veteran? Am I an active service member?” - P14
-  8 of 12 participants were able to access the filer modal with some verbal prompting by the moderator
   - Some participants noted that they had seen the Show filters button and chose not to open it
   - These participants expressed appreciation for the filters feature once they did engage with it
> "I noticed it and completely ignored it, cause I felt like I didn't need it". - P12
> “Clearly the filters are great because it helps to be more specific… I think these are good choices (options).” - P12 
> “It didn’t seem necessary.” - P10
> “I like that right away, they have you filter for different populations.. below that, the benefits… this is an excellent idea!” - P10 
> “Filters can be confusing for me, so I tend to stay away from them.” - P13 
> “Oh, that is good! It narrows the field down dramatically. I think it points you in the right direction unequivocally.” - P13
-  1 participant was not able to succesfully interact with the filter modal

### Finding 4  - A majority of  participants (7/12) expressed frustration of confusion related to tags

- Confusion caused by expectation/mental model of tag functionality
- “This is what I feared… it looks like it took me back to that first page… I wanted to go further out, not back” - P12 - stated after clicking on a tag in the article Appears that the relationship of tags to filter chips and refinement of search results was not clear
- “I’m pissed…it just took me back to the same page that I just came from!” - P14 after clicking on a tag and coming to the results page frustrated her.
- Confusion by the word “tag” 
- “Tags… that means nothing to me….” P1 - He mentioned that he was unfamiliar with tags as a terminology/label
- Frustration with space taken by large amounts of tags
- “Now I am confused because I was already on the Claims Status FAQ, so something does not make sense to me” - P8 - Stated after clicking on claims & claim status tag on the Claims FAQ page. She did not scroll below the tag section to see the content below
-  “It's pretty big.” - P3 on the space that the tags take up in the interface
-  “I'm not sure why it it pops up, and you know, clobbers that space. In other words.” - P4 on the space that tags take up in the interface

### Finding 5 - Half of the participants (6/12) experienced confusion and frustration with the filter chips functionality.
-  “Oh goodness… it’s got more tags!! There needs to be an explanation of what a tag is, what a filter is.” - P8
- This initial assumption and the need for explanation suggest an initial lack of understanding or potential confusion about how to access and use them. She later stated, "If I knew what the filters were for, I think I might be able to find what I am looking for more directly…"
-  Filters can be confusing for me, so I tend to stay away from them. I don’t have any idea what those filters are.” - P13 - He understood what the filter text means, but not sure what the functionality of them might be.

### Finding 6 - After initially experiencing some confusion, or not interacting with the feature, and with later questions/prompts from the moderator, the majority of participants understood how the filter chips on results/detail pages (w/X) work vs. on the landing page (w/o X).
- 8 participants understood this, with 2 among them not clear on how filters worked
- “I would guess it is a filter because it says filter right below it. I don't know if they would be clickable...” - P11
- 4 participants did not understand this, with one among this group not understanding the tags functionality and it’s correlation to filter chips
- “I don’t have any idea what those filters are...  I don’t know why the x is there. Why you would you x it out” - P13

### Finding 7 -  Almost all of the participants (10/12) understood the filter group label meanings: Audience, Benefit, Topic, and chose a filter that aligned with their needs.
- “So, audience filter by audience, veterans, family members, care givers, active service members. I don’t really understand. I guess the audience would be me. I mean when I think of audience, I think of somebody other than myself. So, I’m not sure where that’s going to go.” - P1
- “This is a little confusing to me…. I am a vet, I don’t have any family or caregivers, I am not an active service member, I do have a slight disability from the VA, and I am very much involved in healthcare…I don’t know if those 3 out of 5 things pertain to me” - P13
- 1 participant found the filter label names confusing
-  “The word ‘management’ is throwing me off” - P11 - stated when looking for info about owing VA money (debt management)

### Finding XX - The majority of the participants (11/12) understood the specifics of the filter modal’s logic between filters across/within filter groups and functionality.

- 11 participants understood the Apply filters buttons, but the majority did not specifically interact with the Clear all or the X buttons.
> “I would clear this filter that it's put on the claims and claim status filter so that I could go back to look at the other link.” - P8
- 6 of 12 participants demonstrate a working understanding the and/or logic of the filters, though most did not explicitly state their understanding
> "I can filter by what applies to me. Like, am I a veteran? I'm an active service member? What benefit I'm looking for. That kind of thing" - P14 
>  “I would expect to be able to, you know, click on any of these and use it to narrow down the information that I'm searching. Just depending on the scenario.” - P7 


## Additional Insights

1. Scrolling & space taken on screen 
    1. 6 participants made comments about the space taken up on the interfaces
        1. “The phone screen being so limited, I wouldn’t want to scroll down.. I might scroll enough to see filters, but I wouldn’t want to scroll past the search terms." - p13

2. What do participants did first—searching, filtering, or browsing...
    1. 4 participants search, then browse
    2. 3 participants wanted to sign-in, then browse
    3. 2 participants wanted to browse, then search
    4. 2 participants browsed
    5. 1 participant filtered
  
3. Participant’s preference for using filters before searching
    1. Only 1 user filtered before searching.
        1. Other participants had their objective of searching or browsing the page to scan for keywords of interest
    2. What participants did next
        1. After the initial task, participants chose to drill down into the site by utilizing other navigation features. 
        2. These depended on their mission and comfort level of the navigation options
         
4. What search terms the participant put in the search box
    1. A common theme of search terms was that the participants had a keyword that was related to their task in mind.
    2. How do search terms overlap with or differ from filter labels?
        1. Based on the search terms that the participants mentioned they would enter, here is what we observed:
            1. Some search terms directly match filter labels (e.g., "Pension").
                1. P4 - the participant initially considered the search box with terms like "pension payments" but then noticed the "payments and debt" link . They navigated to this section and saw relevant options like "direct deposit information" 
            2. Some  of the participant’s search terms overlap with broader filter categories. For example, looking for "Travel reimbursement" overlapped with the "healthcare" or "payments and debts" filters.
                1. “Compensation for travel...There you go, reimbursed Va. Travel expenses and mileage rate.” - P10 - suggested the search term "Compensation for travel," which could potentially align with the Topic filer ‘Payments & Debts.’"
                2. “When we don’t see something right away, we don’t want to scroll down any further” - P6 on frustration felt when the search terms he had in mind are not seen in filter and article labels.
            3. Some search terms are related to a participant’s task
    3. Other filters that participants expected that were missing
        1. 6 participants had expectations for filters that did not exist
            1. P1 hoped for "reimbursement" to be a more obvious option, possibly as a standalone filter or within a travel-related category, when looking for travel compensation
            2. P3 expressed a desire to filter information more specifically by benefit type, such as wanting to see information specifically related to Chapter 35 under education benefits or distinguishing Champ VA information more clearly within healthcare resources.

5. Different outcomes of different user groups (Veterans, family members and caregivers, service members) 
    1. While there were some common comments and issues faced by members of certain user groups, it is not clear that there is a definitive difference on the outcome of their tasks based on this.

6. Other factors (e.g., frequency of VA.gov use, VA benefits received) that affected how easily the participant was able to find relevant information
    1. There were several patterns of factors that we observed that affected how easily participants were able to find relevant information
    2. Frequency of use and prior experience were the most common

7. Participant expectations of the scope of R&S search vs. site-wide search
    1. In general participants expected to be able to find content related to benefits and services that they could obtain from the prototype. 2 participants had such bad experience with VA.gov search, that they either wanted to use a third party search tool, or avoid search entirely.

8. Participant's previous experiences with searching/browsing for information on VA.gov
    1. While 2 participants had very negative experiences obtaining information from VA.gov, the other participants had generally good experiences and clear objectives for getting information from VA.gov. 
    2. 4 participants made comments that the experience has been improving
    3. Participant sentiment towards the test site search functionality is mixed. While some participants mentioned an appreciation for recent improvements on VA.gov, others remain frustrated and find the search function difficult to use. This may have influenced some statements and views on the search function in the prototype. 
    4. Search is preferred over browsing for participants with specific information needs, those in a rush, or those unsure where to find information. However, some participants expressed reluctance to use search, fearing they might get stuck in loops.

9. General navigation observations
    1. Tendency to want to sign-in for “personalized” information 
        1. 7 participants specifically mentioned wanted to sign-in to see personalized content that relevant to them and their task
    2. Browsing & keywords
        1. Common topics
            1. Participants tended to browse to this looking for terms/keywords related to their task or objective
        2. Browse by benefit
            1. Participants tended to browse to this looking for for terms/keywords related to specific benefits
        3. Search results
            1. 3 participants mentioned reluctance to use search due to fears of getting ‘stuck in loops’ or getting lost.
