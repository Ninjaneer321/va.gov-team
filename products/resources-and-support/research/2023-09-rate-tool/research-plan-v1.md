#  Research Plan for Veterans Support Team, Resources and Support, Rate your experience feedback mechanism.

## Background
Resources and support (R&S) contains tier 2 content (benefit-adjacent content). The Rate your experience feedback mechanism was introduced to R&S article pages with the option to rate articles as either good or bad. As a part of the Rate your experience product initiative, once a user rates an article as 'bad', we would like to implement a way for users to report the reason why they rated the page poorly. We would also like these issues to be actionable and easily accessible for the content owners so that improvements can be easily made.

We would like to make improvements to the layout of R&S article pages.

[See product brief ](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/contact-center-62cdd9546ec1530018209672/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/65148)

### OCTO Objectives 
Improving Resources and Support will allow Veterans and those in their support system to find information on utilizing their VA.gov account, gaining supplemental information on benefits, and easily find links to apply for benefits or make changes to their account.

### Veteran Journey
Resources and support impacts the Veteran journey from Starting up and all phases thereafter.

## Research Goals and Questions	

### 1. Validate that users are able to easily use the Rate Feedback mechanism to provide feedback on the article pages and report an appropriate problem.
- Are users able to find where they can rate and report feedback?
- What do users expect to see after they submit feedback?
- In what situation would a user rate this page? Why would they rate it 'good', why would they rate it 'bad'?
- Does the wording make sense? If not, what should it say?
- Do the options under "How would you rate your experience' make sense to users?
- What other types of problems would they expect to report?
- What do users think about the amount of issues presented to them? Is the amount overwhelming?
- What are their perceptions on the difference between this feedback tool and Medallia?
- **Content creator question:** 
	- What type of feedback is helpful and actionable to them?
	- How can we make this feedback more accessible to them?

### 2. Are users able to easily navigate and discover the rate your experience feedback mechanism on the article pages?
- Do users utilize rate your experience feedback mechanism on the article pages?
- Do users utilize the feedback button near the footer on the article pages?


### 3. Is the question "How would you rate your experience" a helpful title that tells users what they will find?
- What do users think of the title, "How would you rate your experience"?
- If users do not feel like "How would you rate your experience" reflects what they find on the section, what else would they name it?


### Outcome
We will confirm whether:
- Updates allow users to provide feedback which will inform content editors on changes that can be made to improve R&S articles
- Updates to R&S article pages improve navigation and discoverability of more R&S articles
- The name "Resources and support" accurately informs users of what content they will find


### Hypothesis

- Users will not know the purpose of the rate your experience feedback mechanism, 
- The good/bad buttons that are currently used to track feedback, are not helpful as the data is recorded in Google Analytics. 
- Users will be more likely to use the feedback button near the footer to leave feedback on the Article page 

## Method	
We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom using a prototype.

### Location
Zoom

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit Veteran participants using a lean maximum variation strategy. We'll leverage Perigean's recruiting services to find our participants.

### Recruitment criteria
Schedule 10 Veterans for a minimum of 8 successfully completed sessions.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

- 50% of participants should be able to participant from a desktop device.

- 50% of participants should be able to participate from a mobile phone.



**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

**Gender**
- 8 women, 8 men

**Inclusion**
- 3 participants who use assistive technology (e.g. screen reader, magnification)
- 10 participants who identify as other than white
- 5 participants who identify as other than straight/heterosexual and cisgender
- 8 participants age 55+
- 8 participants who identify as having a cognitive disability
- 5 participants who do not have a college degree
- 5 participants who live in a rural area


## Timeline
Completion of 8 successful research sessions between October 16 - October 23.

### Prepare
•	Research team will organize pilot.

### Research sessions
•	Planned dates of research: October 16 - October 23
•	We would like to request that Perigean calls each participant to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them. And please include the session time in each participant's own time zone (from a screener question).

### Length of sessions
45 minutes. Perigean will schedule the sessions with buffer 30 minutes of buffer time to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

•	Session Length:
o	45 minutes non assistive technology users
o	60 minutes assistive technology users
•	Buffer time: 30 minutes between sessions.
•	Maximum sessions per day: 3


### Availability
•	10/16: 12pm - 5pm ET
•	10/17: 12pm - 5pm ET
•	10/18: 12pm - 5pm ET
•	10/19: 12pm - 5pm ET
