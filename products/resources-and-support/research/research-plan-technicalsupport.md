## Research Plan for [Reimagining Technical Support (Screensharing), 6/27/2024]


## Background

To assess the feasibility and potential impact of implementing screen sharing capabilities in veteran support services by gathering insights from veterans. 

Where is your product situated?
[survey](https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/questions/nrkfwu5m).

## OCTO Priorities
Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

## Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter?

## Research Goals

Understanding Veterans' needs can help identify the specific needs and preferences of veterans regarding support services. This is crucial to ensure that screen sharing is a solution that aligns with their expectations and comfort levels​.

- Assess Needs: Understand veterans' needs and preferences regarding support services.

- Evaluate Potential Impact: Measure how screensharing could improve service delivery and satisfaction.

- Identify Barriers: Identify technical, privacy, and acceptance barriers to adopting screensharing technology.

- Gather Feedback: Collect qualitative and quantitative feedback to guide decision-making.


## Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:

What will I do with what I learn from this question?
Does this question serve the goals of my study?
Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the conversation guide.

## Hypothesis
Based on our understanding of the problem space and our assumptions, we can formulate the following hypothesis:

Implementing screensharing capabilities in veteran support services will lead to increased satisfaction and improved issue resolution times among veterans who have adequate technical resources and comfort with technology. However, concerns regarding privacy and technical barriers may limit adoption among certain subsets of the veteran population.

## Methodology

Survey Instrument: An online questionnaire designed to gather data on veterans' experiences, preferences, and concerns regarding screensharing technology.

Survey Sections:

Introduction: 

Purpose of the survey, confidentiality assurance, and consent.
Demographic Information: Age, gender, military service details.
Current Support Experience: Satisfaction with existing services, types of issues faced.
Screensharing Experience: Prior use, comfort level, perceived benefits.
Concerns and Barriers: Privacy, security, technical challenges.
Feedback and Suggestions: Open-ended questions for additional insights.

Question Types:

Multiple Choice

Likert Scale

Open-Ended

## Location

Optimal Workshop 

## Recruitment criteria

Target Population: U.S. veterans who currently use or have used veteran support services.

Sample Size: 50 participants to ensure diverse perspectives and sufficient data for analysis.
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study.

To ensure the survey participants are suitable and can provide meaningful feedback regarding the implementation of screensharing technology in veteran support services, the following demographics, experiences, and scenarios must be met:

## Demographics

Veteran Status:

Participants must have served in the U.S. military.

Current Interaction with VA Services:

Participants should be currently receiving benefits or services from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or have used veteran support services in the past 12 months.

Technical Proficiency and Access:

Participants must have regular access to a stable internet connection and a device capable of screensharing (desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone).

## Experience and Scenarios

Experience with Current Support Services:

Participants should have recent experience (within the last 12 months) with using VA support services.

Comfort with Technology:

Participants must have some level of comfort with using computers and the internet.

Privacy and Security Awareness:

Participants should be aware of and have opinions on privacy and data security concerns related to screensharing technology.

## Screener Questions

Current VA Services Interaction:

Have you used any veteran support services in the past 12 months?

- Yes (qualifies)
- No

Technical Proficiency:

How comfortable are you with using computers and the internet?

- Very comfortable (qualifies)
- Comfortable (qualifies)
- Neutral (qualifies)
- Uncomfortable
- Very uncomfortable

Internet Access:

- Yes (qualifies)
- No

What type of device do you primarily use to access the internet?

- Desktop computer (qualifies)
- Laptop (qualifies)
- Tablet (qualifies)
- Smartphone (qualifies)

- Yes (qualifies)
- No

How frequently do you use screensharing technology?
- Daily (qualifies)
- Weekly (qualifies)
- Monthly (qualifies)
- Rarely (qualifies)
- Never

Privacy and Security Concerns:

Do you have any concerns about sharing your screen with support agents for troubleshooting purposes?
- Yes (qualifies)
- No (qualifies)
  
If yes, please specify your concerns:
By using these screener questions, the survey can effectively filter for participants who meet the necessary criteria to provide valuable insights into the feasibility and potential impact of implementing screensharing technology in veteran support services.

## Timeline

Week 1: Finalize survey design and prepare materials.
Week 2-3: Distribute the survey and begin data collection.
Week 4: Send follow-up reminders to increase response rate.
Week 5: Close survey and start data analysis.
