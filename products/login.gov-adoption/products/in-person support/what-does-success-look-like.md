# In-person proofing pilot: What does success look like?

**Last updated: May 6, 2024**

Figuratively speaking, the train has left the station as far as the in-person pilot project goes. However, there is still room to discuss what success looks like to make sure the final months of the pilot effort feel productive and fruitful.

## Conversations we should have

- What was the original mandate this team was given re: in-person proofing?
- Were more MVP approaches ever discussed, or were these determined to be out of scope?
  - Eg. Training existing staff on how to support people through existing channels
- How is the team defining success for this project (prior to any reframing we might do)?

## Things it would be helpful to have fully documented before the end of this effort

- Original mandate
- Solutions considered
- Process to get to solution
- Who we talked to and worked with
- Results of the usability test
- Lessons learned across the entire engagement
