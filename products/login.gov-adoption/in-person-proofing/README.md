## What is In Person Proofing

In Person Proofing (IPP) is a service that provides an in person method for validating a login.gov account. A Veteran must have a validated account in order to access their benefits on VA.gov (as well as services at other federal and state agencies). This project provides an alternative, physical process as an alternative to login.gov or id.me’s virtual proofing process, in which a participant uploads a photo of their face and photo ID.
