Identified need for long-term co-creation engagement with a) caregivers of Veterans and b) Veterans who have or are experiencing houselessness. Through research for in-person identity proofing, each population segment experienced unique barriers to identity verification that we had not explored in depth nor addressed in the product build. The following documentation is the initial research plan for a longitudinal engagement with both user groups. The efforts were paused due to prioritization and team bandwidth.

Project Title 

CEDAR Identity login.gov/ID.me Adoption Campaign Pilot and Co-Creation Study

--

Background
----------

Veteran Affairs (VA) continues to digitize across systems and services to ensure access and security for all Veterans. The phased migration to Login.gov ameliorates barriers by consolidating platform login and increasing security for Veterans and non-Veteran users. For the digital migration to [login.gov](http://login.gov), VA is conducting a phased communication campaign to ensure that the shift to digital does not leave any Veterans behind. The phased communication campaign provides online and physical touchpoints to support adoption of modern credentials through a) self-service (including remote helpdesk support)  and b) through/with in-person proofing support. Partnerships with agencies like MO offer opportunities to learn how Human-Centered Design and generative research can optimize a digital migration and phased communication campaign.

### Research Project Overview

A three month longitudinal study of generative research and participatory design workshops initiated by a preliminary pilot. As of now, the pilot and longitudinal study will be conducted virtually. Recruit Veterans and Veteran support network to participate in focus groups and co-creation workshops. Offer preliminary pilot participants opportunity for continued engagement over three months. During the preliminary pilot, participants and researchers will co-create expectations and structure of longitudinal study should there be interest. Primary goal is to assess awareness and receptivity to In Person Proofing methods and communication campaigns created by MO to promote migration to a Login.gov credential. Secondary goal is to assess feasibility and Veteran and Veteran support network interest in a longitudinal study. More specifically, feasibility and participant interest in using focus group and co-creation research and design methods, and staying engaged over a period of time.

#### Research Goals

##### Primary

1.  Discover new strategies, language, and channels to educate Veterans about Login.gov.

2.  Leverage trusted communities and resources to provide migration support, especially to those who display more hesitancy and resistance.

3.  Uncover jobs to be done that pertain to accessibility and edge cases.

4.  Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of our iterations through rapid workshops and prototypes.

#####

##### Secondary

1.  Learn how to best engage a group of Veterans on an on-going basis.

2.  Learn about how Veterans influence one another towards adoption.

#### Research Questions

1.  How might we leverage the Veteran community to increase awareness and migration to Login.gov?

2.  How might we adapt virtual and in person communication channels to increase trust and support in our services?

3.  How might we develop virtual and in person communication channels that address differing levels of hesitancy?

4.  How might we ensure that our services are well designed for all Veterans?

5.  How might we use this study's methodology as an example for future campaigns and research for Veteran facing services?

#### Research Outcomes

1.  Refine key messages

2.  Identify key support needs and when to offer certain support aids

3.  Update communication strategy and toolkit

These research outcomes will be unique to a) self service, including remote helpdesk support, and b) through/with in-person proofing support

#### Research in support of:

Commitment to Digital Modernization - Veteran Affairs' modernization initiative is a commitment to providing streamlined and secure access to all VA products and services. By researching opportunities to use in person proofing throughout digital migration the VA can ensure exclusion is reduced and possibly identify future use for in person proofing and co-creation with Veterans as a tool for research and future initiatives.

Executive Order on Preventing and Addressing Identity Fraud in Public Benefits Programs - These efforts will ensure continued fraud reduction and increased security for users, carrying forth President Biden's call to action. In Person Proofing offers an opportunity to reduce fraudulence with in person verification without sacrificing the ease of creating a login.gov credential and its affordance of stronger digital service security.

Executive Order on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government - In striving to improve the federal customer experience and security, trust is an essential building block and outcome integral to the digital modernization of Veteran Affairs. Generative research and human-centered design not only offer meaningful research methods but also build trust by centering the user as both the source of knowledge and the collaborator to ensure their needs guide the work and determine its success. 

### Research Methodology:

#### Co-creation, generative research

We will mostly engage in a group format (5-8 participants). In order to ensure that individual voices are heard, we may either ask for pre-work (not longer than 15 minutes or reflection/capture) or have individual heads-down time during the group sessions, preparing for discussions. The sessions will be a combination of exploring current state experiences with conversation prompts or creative activities; and envisioning desired solutions through brainstorms informed by prototypes and role play. During the sessions, we will pay attention to the inputs from participants as well as how they interact with each other, namely, who and what influences individuals and the group to change their attitudes and perspectives. Because of the longitudinal nature of these interactions, we also plan on asking for feedback on the session design, and bringing in learning from previous sessions and reporting on what they informed us.

#### Trauma informed approach

To ensure the research experience for participants is respectful and supportive, a trauma informed approach will be used for both pilot and the longitudinal study. During research review through Veteran Affairs, collaboration sessions will be held in pre-research planning to review workshop design and identity structures and resources to provide trauma informed practice throughout the research process.

#### Pilot

Establish an initial pilot study of three workshops for iterative engagement of Veterans and Veteran support networks in the development process and mixed method and generative research. During the pilot, participants will do workshops that allow for co-creation of expectations within the pilot and into the longitudinal study should they participate. There is also opportunity to do initial research into participant awareness and receptivity to the phased communication campaign. The pilot also allows for gauging initial interest in longer term engagement in the longitudinal study. 

#### Co-Creation Study

The longitudinal study is an extension of the pilot and pilot attendees are encouraged to continue participation in the longitudinal study. The longitudinal study is optimal as it offers the following benefits:

-   Continuity and familiarity: Having consistent study participants throughout the development process allows for continuity and a deeper understanding of the service. Participants become familiar with the service's evolution, goals, and challenges, which allows them to navigate different topics more effectively.

-   Building relationships and trust: Long-term engagement with the same participants fosters stronger relationships and trust between the development team and the users. Participants feel valued and invested in the service's success, leading to a more collaborative and productive partnership.

-   In-depth understanding: Over time, the participants can gain a comprehensive understanding of the service, its nuances, and the various user types. This allows for more detailed feedback, targeted discussions, and meaningful insights into addressing hesitancies and meeting user needs.

-   Iterative improvements: By involving the same participants throughout the development process, we are able to gather feedback on prototypes, early versions, and subsequent iterations of the service. This iterative feedback loop helps refine and enhance the user experience over time.

-   Efficiency and cost-effectiveness: Engaging the same participants can save time and resources in terms of onboarding and orientation. The participants are already familiar with the service, its goals, and the context, allowing discussions and feedback to be more focused and productive.

Recruitment
-----------

Each session will have 5-8 participants per session. For every session Perigean will oversee recruitment. Over recruitment is encouraged assuming likelihood of no shows/drop out therefore criteria will be out of 8. Should Veterans only be able to attend with support network members (for example, caregiver, family member or friend), we will designate specific sessions for both Veteran and their support network member to attend. Both Veteran and support network members will still register with Perigean in order to be compensated and be able to sign up for those designated workshop sessions. See Approach to Recruit in Appendix

Participant characteristics should be distributed in a manner offering diversity in ethnicity, gender, age, ability, and housing. Given the small size of each co-creation study group per session, it will not be possible for the sample to be representative.

### Registration 

Participants will need to initially register with Perigean as a participant, regardless if they join at the start of the pilot or throughout the study. For each session registered participants will need to sign up through Perigean in order to be compensated per session. 

### Compensation

Given a registered participant completes a 90 minute workshop, they will receive $60 from Perigean. An extra incentive may be offered to participants should they complete all pilot and longitudinal study session to encourage regular attendance.

--

APPENDIX
--------

### Approach to Recruit:

Identify the right participant group composition through initial recruiting sessions for each of the segments

Establish a clear purpose for the pilot and longitudinal study; prepare brief for recruiting partners and define the specific goals and objectives of the study. Clearly communicate the purpose of the study to the participants and ensure they understand their roles and responsibilities. This will help set expectations and ensure alignment.

Define user types based on current login approach and level of hesitancy

Recruit a diverse participant group with three users per segment (8 total)

Facilitate open communication in a supportive and inclusive environment where participants feel comfortable expressing their opinions, concerns, and hesitancies; employ different methods to encourage active participation and ensure that all have an equal opportunity to contribute

Set up a cadence of interactions, build on the previous interaction -- summarize so all participants have a similar starting point for the conversation at hand -- and foreshadow future ones, as consistency and continuity is important for engagement

Utilize various engagement mechanisms, like one-on-one interviews, co-creation sessions, async feedback/online forum, surveys

Incorporate inputs effectively into iterative campaign development. Given this is a generative study, there will be no direct usability testing. However, through co-creation activities and discussion, participants can inform attitudes and approaches that the communication campaign can be adapted to support. Researchers will communicate the actions taken as a result of the feedback to the participants, demonstrating that their input is valued and influential.

Acknowledge the efforts and contributions of participants,  provide compensation for workshops attended.

Stay adaptable to changes, incorporate feedback from participants into how to facilitate engagement, stay adaptable and continue iterating the approach to ensure the workshops remains effective

##### Risks and potential mitigations

Lack of fresh perspectives: While continuity has its advantages, using the same participants for an extended period might limit the introduction of new perspectives and fresh insights. Over time, participants may become accustomed to the service and potentially miss important considerations or blind spots

Invite participants to reach out into their network for additional input. For example, participants may invited members of their support network to register with Perigean and participate in the study.

Bias and groupthink: Maintaining the same participants can lead to potential bias and groupthink. Participants may start aligning their opinions or be influenced by the dominant perspectives within the group.

Actively seek diverse viewpoints and consider formats that allow for individual contribution before discussion or create break-out sessions that take power/viewpoint dynamics into consideration

Fatigue and disengagement: Participants members may experience fatigue or reduced engagement over time, particularly if the development process becomes lengthy or repetitive.

-   Consider recruiting a larger cohort and then offering opt-in sessions

-   Provide meaningful updates, addressing their feedback, and recognizing their contributions

Limited scalability: If the campaign evolves in a way that was not anticipated initially, the participant representation and diversifying of the workshop group may become necessary. Anticipate ways of how to bring in other participants/viewpoints without creating alienating group dynamics

###

### Screener Questions

-   On a scale of 1 to 10:

-   How comfortable are you with trying new services or technologies?

-   How important is trust and security to you when engaging with a new service?

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Sofia, Sophia, or Svenja] and I am joined by my fellow researchers [Sofia, Sophia, or Svenja] who will be helping out with facilitation and notetaking.


## Prep - 5 minutes
Today marks the first session of a long term study where we will be discussing how you sign in to your healthcare and benefits on VA.gov. For today’s workshop, we are interested in learning more about each of you, your experiences with VA, and how you leverage your support networks when interacting with VA’s services. As this study progresses, there will be opportunities to create and suggest possible alternatives to ensure an improved experience for yourself and fellow Veterans. Your participation today will not impact your ability to access VA services now or in the future.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability or evaluating your experience. We just want to understand your perspectives so that we can better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Introductions - 5 minutes

Before we get started on activities, I would like to introduce our team here today.

[Each participant introduces themselves and how long they have worked for the VA]

Now I would like to go around and learn your names and how long you have served. I will be reading names from the list on Zoom, so if you have a different preferred name please introduce yourself with that name.

## First Task: Establishing Norms - 30 minutes
Given that the nature of today’s workshop, and future workshops, is collaborative, it is important to establish norms. Norms are commitments that we decide on together, and we each can uphold them to ensure we have a shared understanding of expectations and a safe space where we can interact with one another. We have a set of questions that we would like to talk through with you all to set up these norms. I will read a question and an example, then we will open up for discussion. If you would like to share your answers in writing, you are welcome to post in the chat, as well. My colleague will capture your responses on a Google Document as well. 

## Brainstorming and selecting norms -15 mins

What overarching norms are important to you when working in a group? For example, every participant’s opinion will be thoughtfully considered.
What communication norms are important to you when working in a group? For example, participants will speak from their own experience.
What norms are important to you during meetings? For example, participants will listen without interrupting.
Does everyone feel comfortable with the norms we have brainstormed? Does anyone have anything else they would like to add or do you need clarification?
Given that we are meeting virtually, we want to ensure that we do not miss what someone has said if there is a technology issue. For a technology norm, if someone is experiencing a technology issue we will do our best to work with that person. Another common issue that can come up is if someone forgets to unmute before they start speaking. We will do our best to notice if someone is trying to speak but please let us know in the chat or check to see if you are muted if no one has reacted to what you have said.
Does everyone feel comfortable upholding the norms written in the document for the remainder of this session?

Thank you for sharing your thoughts. This Google Document will serve as a reminder at the start of each session of the norms we have collaboratively set. If the group needs to adjust these norms, that is an option throughout the duration of the study. As researchers, we would like to mention a few norms that would help us facilitate safe and collaborative sessions. 

##Introduce Activities

Today we have three activities lined up, and we would like to try to get through at least to two of them and potentially have the this one take place in our next session. These activities are meant to help identify specific experiences to learn from and understand the systems of support you used as well as inform what we will explore in the upcoming workshops. 

## Second Task: Empathy Mapping Activity - 45 minutes
Our first activity will be filling out what we call an “Empathy Map”. An empathy map is a tool we use to understand the thoughts, feelings, sensations, and opinions of users as they engage with a product or a service. In this instance, we want to learn more about veterans' experiences with sign in services on VA.gov. As you can see on this model, there is one person in the middle of it. This does not mean that we expect everyone here to agree or have the same experience. In fact, we want to encourage diverse thoughts and opinions so we as researchers can gain a better understanding of the entire population. 

Instructions:
Researcher shares screen of empathy map
You will notice on the empathy map there are several sections. Each section allows us to think through feelings or factors that might be present as we engage with a VA product or service. We will go through each section and ask the group questions. There may be different responses in each section, or responses that contradict others, that is ok. As we mentioned, the empathy map depicts one person, but in this session our goal is to best capture everyone’s experience.

After each question, we ask that you share your response out loud. We will then ask you to summarize your thoughts in one sentence. We will write that one sentence in the map as a reference point and refer back to the recording to capture your entire response in the map after the workshop today. 

Questions:
What kinds of things do you need to accomplish when you sign into VA.org?
What do you think of when you see VA.gov or the sign on screen?
Have you noticed any changes to VA.gov or how you manage your benefits online?

Where are you when you engage with VA.gov online services?
How would you describe your experience of signing in to VA.gov to someone else?

What technologies might you use to sign in and access VA.gov?
What do you need to do when you go online to VA.org?

Describe who you go to for support
Have you heard any news about VA.gov?
What have you heard others say about VA.gov?
Do we need to consider for someone else besides you--scenarios for them to solve/create
Who might you go to if you needed support or clarification?

How do you feel about signing in to access your benefits online?
What would make it easier for you to sign in?
What changes would you make for someone like you?

Follow Up Questions
What have been changes to VA.gov that have made it easier to achieve what you need to do?
What have been changes to VA.gov that have made it harder to achieve what you need to do?

When you have interacted with similar products and services that are not in the VA.gov, who do you go to in your support network for help? Why is that the same or different?


### Things to watch for:
- Some participants may speak up more than others. As these patterns come up, try to recognize the quieter voices in the room and engage with them first when presenting questions.
- Always offer a counter opinion or perspective and remind participants that diversity in thought is encouraged: “I want to make sure all perspectives are covered here so that we get the best understanding of all veterans that we can. Is there anything here that anyone would like to add to, clarify, or discuss further?”
- If there is disagreement among team members that goes on a tangent default to norms that were established by the group and refer to them while changing subjects or mitigating differences
- If someone is upset in the middle of a group discussion, say “I would like to take a moment to pause. I see that this discussion is bringing up some strong feelings and stress. In the interest of prioritizing everyone’s comfort, I would like to suggest that we move on. If anyone would like to take a break and step away for a moment though please let me know”

## Third Task: Icon Metaphor Activity 1 - 15 minutes
For our next activity, we will break out into small groups so that we as facilitators can hear more from each individual about their perspectives and relationship with VA.gov. You will be assigned a break out room so please standby as we transition.

Hello everyone. We would like you to think of a metaphor, like an object or person, that represents your perception of VA.gov and what you experience when you sign in. After you have chosen your metaphor, I will ask you to tell me a story that connects to your metaphor and why you chose it. Please feel free to share as much or as little as you would like to give context to your metaphor. As you talk, I will find your metaphor in the form of an icon and write notes on this Mural here to capture your story.

Let’s take a look at this example: Jill has chosen to represent her sign in experience with VA.gov like riding a public bus. Just like how she knows what bus she needs to take, she knows what to do to access VA.gov. Sometimes there are changes to VA.gov, just like there are changes to the bus schedule. This can make things difficult and confusing. The other day, Jill saw a message on VA.gov that she has to make a new sign in account with VA.gov. She would not like to change her routine because she is comfortable and she does not want to get lost.

Please take a few minutes to come up with your own metaphor and tie it in with a story from your experience. Try to think about how you perceive VA.gov, a story that captures a part of your sign in experience, and how that experience makes you feel. I will call us back and ask you to share so that I can add your metaphor and story to our board here.

[Participant’s name], what is your metaphor?
Why have you chosen this metaphor and do you have a story that comes to mind?
Follow up: How does this experience make you feel about VA.gov?

Thank you everyone for sharing, we will transition back to the main room for our last activity. Please standby.

### Things to watch for:
- Participants who may become emotional or upset when recalling a story.
- Affirm the person’s experience, take a pause, and offer a break if needed: “Thank you for sharing, that sounds very difficult and upsetting. Please let me know if you would like to take a pause here.”
- If there is a long pause, depending if the context of the pause is due to perceived negative feelings, ask: “Are you ok to move forward to another question”, “Would you like to revisit this topic at a later time, please let me know, “Would you like to pause”, etc. However, if the long pause appears to come from a transition between questions or waiting on another participant, transition comments from the researcher can be shared to humanize the pause.
- For the participants who end up talking about other people more than themselves, ask: how do you feel when you witness someone else’s experience?


## Fourth Task: Complaint and Thank You Card Activity 2 in Main Zoom Room- 15 minutes (10 mins for writing, 5 mins for reading)

For our final activity, we would like you to write two letters. One is a letter of complaint describing a painful part of the experience. Imagine you are writing to VA.gov about a difficulty you had when you were trying to sign in to understand your healthcare benefits. The other is a thank you note to someone who helped you through an experience that made it a more pleasant one. Afterwards, you have an opportunity to read your letters out loud to the group. 

Alternative Digital option
We are going to send you a link to a Google form in the chat. This link is unique to you and only you and the researchers will be able to view it. It will not be shared with others unless you would like to share it out loud.

Share out Google Form link for participants to write responses. They may read them out loud when finished

*Still discussing the format of response submission. 

If anyone is still working, please take the next few moments to wrap up and submit your letters. In the meantime, would anyone like to share their complaint or thank you letter to the group?

### Things to watch for:
- Give one minute time reminders and let participants know that it is okay to submit something short or not completely edited
- If participants would not like to share, this is okay
- If participants become distressed or upset while writing or sharing letters, acknowledge and affirm their feelings and offer to take a break or let them end their session early if need be. Be sure to reassure that their contribution is valued and they will still receive compensation.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies).]

In addition to using the platform documentation, we will also refer to Charlotte Cesana’s Emergency response user flow to navigate situations where a participant may be in a crisis or at risk of self harm.

We plan on using the VA’s recommended exit strategies to protect our research team members:
Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
Blame technology: I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about a communication campaign that the VA is launching on changes to digital services. During this workshop today, as well as others in this series, should you participate, you will have opportunities to share your experiences with VA services as well as co-create possible solutions to ensure a smooth experience for yourself and fellow Veterans. Your participation today will not impact your ability to access VA services now or in the future.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- *This entire session should take about 90 minutes.* I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- *In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.* We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve experiences to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- *If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.*
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. *Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?*
- If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- If yes: Admit observers.
- Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the p

Uphold confidentiality
These sessions will always be a group of at most 8 participants and 2-3 researchers. What you share and create during these sessions will be kept confidential [should any material be shared your information will be de-identified meaning no personal identifying information will be made public]. We expect all participants and researchers to respect confidentiality and not share what others have said or who they are outside of these sessions. Your participation or what you share during these sessions will not impact your ability to access VA care and benefits nor that of your family and/or care network. 

Researcher Introductions
Researchers share their names, role and how long they have been doing research

Participant Introductions
Researchers ask participants to share their name and how long they serviced and/or worked at the VA

Establishing Norms (30 min)
Given the nature of today’s workshop, and future workshops, is collaborative, it is important to co-create and establish norms that we each can uphold to ensure we have a shared understanding of expectations and how to interact with one another.

## Intro (4 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Sofia, Sophia, or Svenja] and I am joined by my fellow researchers [Sofia, Sophia, or Svenja] who will be helping out with facilitation and notetaking.

Today is our second session out of three to continue our discussion about how you sign in to your healthcare and benefits on VA.gov.We have a few activities planned to explore how you navigate through changes made to VA.gov.

Before we start, I want to cover a few logistics::

- **This entire session should take about 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability or evaluating your experience. We just want to understand your perspectives so that we can better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 


## Goals (1 minute): 

For today’s workshop, we are interested in learning about how you respond to change and what resources you use to inform your decisions. We will begin by discussing general changes you have had to adapt to in life, and then we will ask you about how you respond to changes made on VA.gov. We have four activities to get through today and each one builds off of the other. Our last activity will be split between this session and the next one.


## First Task: Warm-up questions (20 minutes)
For our first activity, let’s start off by talking about how each of us might react to a change that is out of our control. Please take a moment to recall a time when one of your favorite businesses changed its hours. If this has not happened to you, imagine what might happen if your favorite business changed its hours. This business could be a store, a hairdresser, a restaurant, or something else. Keep this scenario in mind as I ask the following questions. I will record all of your responses on this interactive whiteboard so that we can all see how we may react to this situation similarly or differently. As I call on you, please say what your favorite business is to provide some context to your answer. Remember there are no right or wrong answers. 

How would you have preferred to be notified about your favorite business changing its hours?

What would you have done  to check if the information you have is true?

What motivated you to adjust to the change? (i.e. resources, people, time, goals)

What supported you during your adjustment?

What prevented you or discouraged you from making a change?

What made the adjustment to this change easy or difficult?

### Things to watch for:
Change can be a triggering topic and it can bring up many uncomfortable and unexpected feelings
A favorite business might be one that is very important to the participant so they may have a strong reaction to the hours being changed
If emotions seem to be escalating and participants look uncomfortable or withdraw, acknowledge the difficulty and ask the group if it is okay to pause or if people would prefer to move on


## Second Task: Chutes and Ladders (20 min)
Let’s move on to our second activity. Is anyone here familiar with the game chutes and ladders? Today we are not going to play the actual game together- we’re actually going to create our own version of the game. Let’s imagine that in this game, the VA is making a change to the way you sign in to VA.gov. On my game board here, I have some different types of tiles that represent some of the things that help you or prevent you from making a change. We have ladders to represent the things that help us or motivate us. We have slides for the things that are challenging or set us back. We also have some other types of tiles: monkey bars for things that distract you and may take you somewhere else and seesaws for things that annoy you and stop you from adjusting to the change. I will remind you what each of these things mean as we put labels on this board.

Now let’s talk about what is on

The starting zone represents you in the beginning of learning about the change to VA sign in services. The finish zone represents you making a change that allows you to maintain your access to VA.gov. Imagine you are in this starting zone right now. Would anyone like to share what they might be feeling like when they first learn about the change? 

[Motivators] Here we have a trampoline. A trampoline motivates you to make a change. What are some of the things that motivate you to make a change that will allow you to sign in to VA.gov?


[Enablers] Ok now let’s look at some of these ladders. Ladders are resources and people help you get closer to your final destination. What are some of the ladders that help you accomplish making a change? 

[Challenges] Now let’s look at the slides. Slides are challenges we come across that set us back. These might be things that prevent us from making a change or they make us not want to make a change. What might these things be for you?

[Distractions] Now let’s talk about the monkey bars. Monkey bars are things that distract us from making a change. What are some factors that take away our attention and make our goal less urgent?


Now that we have an idea of what some of these things represent, where would you place them on the board?

### Things to watch for:
- Some participants may speak up more than others. As these patterns come up, try to recognize the quieter voices in the room and engage with them first when presenting questions.
- Always offer a counter opinion or perspective and remind participants that diversity in thought is encouraged: “I want to make sure all perspectives are covered here so that we get the best understanding of all veterans that we can. Is there anything here that anyone would like to add to, clarify, or discuss further?”
- If there is disagreement among team members that goes on a tangent default to norms that were established by the group and refer to them while changing subjects or mitigating differences
- If someone is upset in the middle of a group discussion, say “I would like to take a moment to pause. I see that this discussion is bringing up some strong feelings and stress. In the interest of prioritizing everyone’s comfort, I would like to suggest that we move on. If anyone would like to take a break and step away for a moment though please let me know”


## Break (5 min)


## Mural Tutorial (5 min)
We will now go into break out rooms for our final activities. In our breakout rooms, your facilitator will give you a quick tutorial for how to use our virtual tool, Mural, which is the tool we have been using to show you all of our activities today. Please standby as we assign you to a breakout room.

Tutorial:
Hello everyone. I will give you a quick demonstration of how we will be using our virtual tool Mural today. On Zoom, please check your chat. You will find a link there to our board which we will be working on. Does everyone have the link? If not, please let me know and I will assist you.

Everyone has a board up and can see my cursor swirling around? [swirl cursor]. Please say yes if you can see it.
Now notice how when I click on this sticky note here it has a border around it? This means that the sticky note is selected. I can click and drag stickies by holding down left click on them and moving my mouse around or your fingers if you are using a trackpad. By double clicking on the sticky, you may write on it. By clicking on the corner of a sticky note and dragging in and out, you may adjust the size of your sticky note. This makes it easier to see what you are writing. Please use the blank sticky notes to write. If at any point you need a new blank sticky note, please let me know and I will make more. 


## Third Task: Red Light, Yellow Light, Green Light (15 min)
I am going to show you different types of communication strategies that the VA has used to update veterans on upcoming changes. I would like to go through each type of strategy to understand which ones you feel are the most effective and why. For each option, we will rank them all together as green, yellow, or red with green meaning very effective, yellow meaning somewhat effective, and red meaning ineffective. We can also move each option to somewhere in between these colors. 
Email
Blog post
Pop up window (Modal or interstitial page)
Letter sent to you
Web page on VA.gov
FAQ section on VA.gov websites

Before we move on I want to ask some questions:
After each communication strategy is placed in a category, or between two, ask participants why they placed it there?
Do these communication examples resonate with you?
In what other ways would you like to find out important changes that are made to your access to healthcare and benefits?
Are there communication examples that you wish the VA would use?
Based on the content of these communication samples, is the information clear, unclear, or is it missing something you would want to know?
Based on the content of these communication samples, what would you change, add or remove?

### Things to watch for:
- Make sure content is visible and ask to make sure that content is visible
- If all responses are similar to each other or if only one person speaks up, offer a counter question by saying “Is anyone able to identify any pros/cons with this communication strategy?”
- Some veterans may feel indifferent to communication strategies. Make sure to ask why they are indifferent or what is lacking from making this strategy more effective
- Sometimes, a veteran may feel isolated in the strategies they prefer. Be sure to welcome diversity in thought and refer to norms from Pilot 0.1 to encourage more input.
- Take 5 second pauses before moving on: “I am going to take a five second pause to make sure I have captured everyone’s input before I move on. [countdown]”



## Fourth Task: Design a communication strategy (15 min)

For our final activity, we would like you to tell another about upcoming changes to VA.gov sign ins. Please choose one of the communication types we discussed from the previous activity such as ___. On orange sticky notes, please write down the information you will include in your communication piece. 
Think about Who, What, Where, and Why.
Who needs to know about the change?
What do they need to know and what do they need to do?
Where do they go to make this change?
Why do they need to make this change?

On blue sticky notes, please write down notes about your strategy by answering the following questions:
What did you consider when writing?
How do you expect your fellow veteran to take this news?
How would you help them feel better about this change or help them accomplish this task?
How often would you reach out to the veteran to remind them?

We will take 15 minutes to work on this activity today. If we run out of time, don’t worry. We will have the chance in our next session to revisit this activity and work on it together. In our next session, we will have everyone present their communication strategy to one of their peers in a breakout session. This will be a good opportunity to give and receive feedback.

Each participant will be assigned to a breakout room. Some of you will stay in the main room with the host of the meeting to complete the activity. Each breakout room group will have their own board to do the activity.
Main Meeting Room Mural
Breakout Room 1 Mural
Breakout Room 2 Mural
Optional: Breakout Room 3 Mural

### Things to watch for:
Participants may be confused by mural and need some extra time to understand how to interact with Mural items
Be ready to give hands-on assistance and ask questions to clarify if the participants would like to do something. Make sure participants stick to the actions described in the tutorial so that no one accidentally interferes with someone else’s work or gets stuck.
Some veterans may not enjoy interacting with Mural or they may not be able to complete the activity. Reassure the veteran that this is ok and provide an alternative option (use pen and paper and have them read aloud their communication strategy in the next session)

## Check out activity - 3 min minutes
Before we leave today, please take the last few minutes to fill out our survey so we can learn about what you thought about today’s workshop.
On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with your overall experience in this workshop?
What aspects of the workshop did you find most valuable?
On a scale of 1 to 5, did the moderator effectively guide the discussion and keep it on track? Please share your thoughts.
How comfortable were you sharing your opinions and insights during the workshop discussions?
Were there any challenges or difficulties you encountered during the session? (e.g. Were there any moments during the session where you felt your perspective was not fully understood or considered?) If so, please describe.
What improvements or changes would you recommend to enhance the quality of future workshops?
Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience or the topic discussed during this workshop?

- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve upon the VA sign in experience. Perigean will send you all invitations for one more follow up session. That session will conclude this series of our overall study.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
