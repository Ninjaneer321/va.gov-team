Date Presented 
04/01/2024

Summary 
SME Interviews of MHV coordinators were conducted in order to better understand the current verification process and identify pain points in order to make suitable and informed design decisions.

Value Add
Without conducting these SME interviews, there would be little to no understanding of the barriers that VA staff currently face when attempting to verify a Veterans identity in person. Based on the insights that were gained during these interviews, the design team was able to properly design the Proofing Agent screens within the custom application.
