## Research Office Hours w/ Robyn Singleton
### Date: July 14, 2023

### Attendees: Svenja Leggewie, Sofia Kirkman
### Sofia's Notes:
- PRA: 4 groups and 4-5 each, questions will switch, recruit 
- Robyn will give us something to format this
- Observation means you’re good to go (direct observation)
- More concrete info with contextualized convos 
- Guided activities or cultural probes depending on research questions
- PO and contract are the only things to worrying about extending this relationship
- Robyn can provide feedback on conversation guide review 
- Same people over time will drive a convo with Perigean
- Perigean will rely on tickets to pay
- Group interactions count on value of the dynamic - can be interesting from a norms perspective; learn what is going to hook people and land well; not be good for usability testing; analytical exercise
- Adapt safety protocols for trauma informed approach
- Explore what can and should be done to navigate if someone brings something up in a group that is different than individual
	⁃	thing about informed consent
	⁃	Don’t share anything you don’t want shared out in the group
	⁃	Emphasize that this will be a group dynamic so we cannot 100% ensure confidentiality
	⁃	Think of how to protect informed consent as an overall proces

### Svenja's Notes:
- Realities of logistics:
- PRA (draw inspiration from Stephanie’s study); 
- Under 9, participants needs to be paid back
- Direct observation: showing something to respond to
- Could do activities
- 1 group with 4 people, in multiple tickets > Robyn 
- Recruit the same people, compensated repeatedly 
- Robyn can help provide feedback on research guides
- Ticket into research depo > Robyn
- They recruit the first time; conversation between us and Perigean
- Group: influencing each other; try out different ways
- Informed consent process – Perigean will prep
- Resources (as researchers): generic e.g., Crisis Line
- Adapt safety protocols:
  - A lot of value in exploring what can/should be done how to navigate if someone up in a group (privacy + norms)
  - Explore with Perigean, kick-off meeting with them, this will be a group dynamics, we can not fully ensure confidentiality



## [Meeting w/ Kevin Hoffman]
### Date: July 14, 2023

### Attendees: Svenja Leggewie, Sofia Kirkman

### Sofia's Notes:
- Thorough review of paperwork reduction act (PRA.digital)

- Options for creating a board:
- A firm has decided to hire a group outside - used for generative ideas but not for evaluative

- For a longitudinal study (1 month or two instances), Perigean can recruit small group that returns (ex: Fitbit cohort that self reports and completes diary studies)
- Come up with something that is bigger than a usability study
- 6 weeks worth of interactions

- High level constraints: cannot survey them without a thing to look at, 

- Four groups of four is PRA safe

- Collab cycle is for producing something
- Cocreation can happen outside of the collab cycle as long as nothing is being shipped

- Reference work by Emily Mann who is no longer at the VA (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19zlY2T9fT4cEP_xXqRshAMmTIr5Z7Stz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108622226059638777190&rtpof=true&sd=true) 

- Frame this as a series of studies instead of a board (customer voice)

### Svenja's Notes:
- Ensure familiarization with the PRA

- Firm has hired a group of Veterans on their own (co-creation), 
- MVP – Stephanie’s Longitudinal study, (integration of fitbit data) w/ Perigean, Robyn Singleton
- Not able to survey them without a thing to look at
- A couple of interactions (6 weeks worth)
- MVP – Consider breaking into 4 groups (and recruiting 4-5 folks each)
- Generative research framing > Collab Cycle – Everytime we ship something (can co-create as much as we want to before shipping) –> reference work by Emily Mann 
- https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/research-history.md (Health Experience Study)
- VA – Amanda Klausmeier, Chantee Lantos (John is in her group), Samara Strauss, anybody in the VES portfolio whom might be appropriate
