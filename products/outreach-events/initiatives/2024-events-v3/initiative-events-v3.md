# Events v3 Intiative Briefing

## Brief Description
How might we enhance a Veteran's experience when they're searching for and viewing events, allowing them to easily find events pertinent to their needs with plenty of lead-time to attend either online or in-person.

How might we ensure that content build times do not exceed 60 minutes when more events are being published?

## The Problem to be Solved

* Problem Defined:
  * How might we enable editors the ability to publish all VA events in order to make them available to Veterans in Outreach & Events?
  * How do we quickly get more editors to publish events without negatively affecting the FE build time? Content build times shouldn't exceed 60 minutes.

* Evidence to support the Problem: 



* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
     * VA North Star: Increase the quality, quantity, and reliability of events published in VA.gov 

## Outcome Summary
  
For this initiative, we will implement in multiple phases, with MVP being the first, and then a fast-follow of a combo of backend and Veteran- & Editor-facing design work.

#### MVP:
- Engineering/Backend: The first iteration will focus on backend functionality:
  - Rebuild events from static HTML into a dynamic React app driven by an API, thus allowing more events to be published without negatively affecting content publish time.
  - Ability to capture/store lat/long of event location.
    
#### Fast-follow:
(in order of priority)
- Design Drupal CMS editorial flows and run usability testing with editors
  - Consider:
    - if an event has more than one location, including one being physical and one being virtual
    - if an event spans across multiple days
    - if an event is a month-long event
- Provide Veterans the ability to find/search for events near them (one of the long-time top-requested features).
- Provide Editors the ability to validate lat/long are correct for locations.
- What do events look like for each of the products?

#### Out of Scope

#### Questions:
- Is there already a MapBox plugin available?
- Do we need to build a MapBox forward lookup for Drupal capability?

## Discovery

### Assumptions/Risks

* #### Value Risks (will people use it)
  - 
* #### Technical Risks 
  - 
* #### Usability Risks (can people figure out how to use it)
  - Noting feedback from Amanda regardog a study, via Slack thread [here](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03LFSPGV16/p1715637703887209): In today's weekly design meeting, Matt Marino (he/him), shared an unexpected finding during a MyVA study that relates to the Sitewide Events product. The number of folks that mentioned this surprised me. It was unclear of where Veterans expected to find this information, MyVA or on a Facility page. The majority of participants indicated they were interested in being informed of VA news, events, alerts, and info about related Veterans organizations. (8 of 15 participants).
