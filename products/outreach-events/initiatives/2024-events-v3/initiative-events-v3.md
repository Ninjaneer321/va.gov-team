  - Noting feedback from Amanda regardog a study, via Slack thread [here](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C03LFSPGV16/p1715637703887209): In today's weekly design meeting, Matt Marino (he/him), shared an unexpected finding during a MyVA study that relates to the Sitewide Events product. The number of folks that mentioned this surprised me. It was unclear of where Veterans expected to find this information, MyVA or on a Facility page. The majority of participants indicated they were interested in being informed of VA news, events, alerts, and info about related Veterans organizations. (8 of 15 participants).
