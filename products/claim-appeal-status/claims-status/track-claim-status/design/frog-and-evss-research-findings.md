# Summary from Frog, EVSS & User Interviews

## Frog Research & Analysis

> "Tell me: what's happening, what's next, what's needed - no jargon"

### Vets want to know 3 primary things:

####1. What’s going on now
We need contextually relevant communications based on the claim type, conditions claimed, etc

####2. How long it will take
Veterans are comfortable with average or estimated times, and much prefer that to nothing at all.

####3. What happens next
All of the steps that are the same between claim types should be presented the same way. Do not create a brand-new process for each claim, or make it seem as if it’s different.

### General Info / Themes

- The most used features in eBenefits are Claim Status and Uploading Documents 
- Many will call the contact center even if they've looked at eBenefits - don't trust the information
- Themes from Stakeholder & SME interviews:
  - Status in layman's terms
  - Explain what is being done during these steps / what is happening
  - describe the documents that are still needed
- If Estimated Completion Date changes, need an explanation as to why that is
- When status goes backwards in the process, it is not explained
- When claim is complete, the options forward are unclear

### Claim Status Themes

#### Timeline for decision not explained

Veterans don't know why the estimated rating date is set as it is; they get anxious when the date changes without explanation and become confused when it doesn’t change for long periods.

#### Back and forth status is confusing

Veterans do not know where they are in the claims process or why a claim may appear to move backwards in eBenefits; the difference between progress and status is unclear.

#### Decision letter is difficult to understand

Decision letters are written in VA jargon and don't explain in straightforward language why some issues are determined service-connected and other are not.

#### Post-decision options are unclear

When Veterans receive a claim decision they don’t agree with, they are unsure what next steps they can take.

#### Status is not descriptive

Veterans want meaningful descriptions and more specific details about what is happening at each stage.

#### Veterans have to ask staff for more detail

Veterans check the status of their claims frequently and through multiple channels, often still call VA or VSO staff or visit in person to get the detail they want, as typically the contact-center representatives can't access that information.

#### Veterans don't know what VA is doing

Veterans don't understand what VSRs are looking for during claims development or additional evidence gathering, so they don’t know how to best prepare.

#### Veterans don't know what to do next

Veterans wonder if they need to take follow-up action to move their claim forward because they may not see ‘what-we-need-from-you’ information in eBenefits. They do, however, receive a confusing information request letter in the mail down the line.

#### Staff are concerned about 'right' level of eBenefits status detail

Some staff are concerned that displaying detailed claims status information would be too much and increase phone call inquiries.

#### Staff rely on VBMS for more detail

Additional status detail is available in VBMS to VSOs and VA Staff. If VSRs don't enter notes into VBMS, staff email or call them for more information.

### Actionable Items / Opportunities Improvement

#### Know VA's actions

Veterans are clear about the actions VA claims developers are taking during different stages. Some specific detail is provided, like the evidence needed for an individual Veteran’s case.

#### Know own actions to take

Veterans are clear about what actions they need to take to move their claim forward, like providing medical documents or a piece of personal information.

#### Understand timeline estimate

Veterans are clear about the factors involved in a timeline estimate. Some specific detail is provided, like average time to get the info needed specific to the individual Veteran. Options to improve the timeframe are offered.

#### Understand decision reasoning

Veterans understand why they received a particular rating, which includes a break down for each issue. Explanation is clear and to-the-point with little jargon.

#### Understand post-decision options

Veterans understand options to reopen or appeal a decision and what evidence they need to change the rating decision. Resources to appeal a specific issue are available.

### Top value-driving themes & descriptors

#### Expectations set for claim processing

Veterans understand what VA is doing and any actions that can be taken to move their individual application forward more swiftly.

#### Individual status details & actions

Veterans receive personalized context for claims status about VA or Vet actions either from system or staff-generated content.

#### Understand claims terminology

Veterans understand status, actions, and decisions from ‘layman’s terms’ descriptions rather than trying to decipher ‘VA-Speak.’

#### Transparent post-decision process

Veterans understand post-decision options and view Appeals status at the same level of detail as claims processing status.

## Veteran interview takeaways

#### Transparency and granularity
“Make the process transparent at a pretty small level. I think he would be fine if he could see his file moving.
Every once and a while they’d say, your medical files were sent to Kansas for photo copying. Even that was comforting. 'Oh good. It’s moving!'”

#### Accurate and useful information
“He may have used some of the online services but found that walking in was useful. If you stand there long enough, sometimes you can get a little info. ...being friendly, etc.”

#### Regularity
“Making things predictable was more important than immediately fixing the problem.”

#### Helpful vs. harmful actions
Wish you could know “if there is opportunity for you to help your case. What you need to do, what you need to NOT do.”

## EVSS background & findings

### User feedback on eBenefits experience

#### Status doesn't change

- Hasn't changed in 4 months, 15 months, 2 years...
- Pending for 5 months, removed est. completion date - why??
- Just says "pending" or "in progress" forever
- Keep logging out and back in to see if the status refreshes - feel like the information might be stuck somehow

#### Lack of information

- A lot of information but not a lot of value, can't find the real status of my claim
- No idea how long the claim process is expected to take
- Says the requested information is missing or late, but does not say what information or whether it is requested from me or another agency

#### Conflicting information

- New information takes 2 weeks to show up in eBenefits
- After successfully uploading evidence, I still get a message that it wasn't received (but a VA rep was able to see it was received)
- Site says development letter has been sent, I never received it
- Conflicting information from screen to screen

#### Dead end

- Says complete since September but no payment
- They are directly responsible for literally hundreds of deaths due to suicide because of their outstanding claims adjudication decisions

### Wireframes:
- Older: [http://iyc2bw.axshare.com/#p=b_4_other_items_sent_by_you](http://iyc2bw.axshare.com/#p=b_4_other_items_sent_by_you)
- More recent: [http://ib9r66.axshare.com/#p=claims_details](http://ib9r66.axshare.com/#p=claims_details)

### Issues / Constraints
- VBMS controls the document services and how we connect data to tracked items and those services
- Corporate DB controls the tables where the BNFT_CLAIM_TYPEs live, there is no CCB process in place and anyone can make requests for new rows, this could mess us up later on

### Tracked Items - problems to solve

- Claimant may think it is their sole responsibility / burden to associated their evidence with the correct Tracked Item
- If user mistakenly associated evidence to wrong Tracked Item, they may fear a delay in processing
- If agent later determines the uploaded evidence is related to another tracked item, there is no feedback loop to the claimant online
- Users can upload a file to a tracked item request and mark it as received, but there is no way to recover if they marked an item as received by mistake
