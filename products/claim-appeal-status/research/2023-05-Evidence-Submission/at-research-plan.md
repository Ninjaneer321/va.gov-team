# Research Plan for Benefits Team 1: Evidence Submission AT Usability Testing (WIP)

TBD

## Background

**This is the Assistive Technology usability testing plan for the Evidence Submission work that is underway. The Research Plan for the other usability study can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-05-Evidence-Submission/research-plan.md).**

In our research on the Decision Reviews and Initial Decision experiences, we've identified a number of issues with the Claim Status Tool experience. One of the main Veteran pain points relates to evidence submission: Veterans don't have a good understanding of what type of evidence to submit, and once the claim is in progress they are anxious about whether there is anything they need to do, or any additional materials they need to provide, to improve the likelihood of a favorable outcome.

With this set of design changes to CST, we hope to make it clearer to Veterans what actions – if any – they need to take to support their claim. We also hope to improve the experience overall, leading to a CST that is clearer, easier to understand, and leaves Veterans feeling more secure about the status of their claim.

### OCTO Priorities 

This work supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md):
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
This work supports a Veteran whenever they are filing a disability compensation claim, which could occur across a wide swath of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), ranging all the way from "Getting out" to "Aging." 

## Research Goals	
- Assess the usability of these CST design proposals for Veterans who use a screenreader or other asssistive technology to access VA.gov.

## Methodology	
Usability testing

### Location
Remote on Zoom

### Research materials

- [Link to conversation guide - To be added](url goes here)
- [Link to prototype - To be added](url goes here)
	
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We would like to recruit Veterans who use screenreaders and have filed a disability compensation claim with the VA. 

### Recruitment criteria
For this study we woud like to recruit 12 total participants. All 12 participants should be screen reader users. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- 4 screenreader users who are at the level "advanced" or "expert."
- 8 screenreader users who are at the level "beginner" or "intermediate."

**Questions**
1. Have you ever filed a disability compensation claim with the VA?
2. Have you ever successfully logged on to VA.gov using your assistive technology?
3. Do you need to use assistive technology to use the internet such as VoiceOver on an iPhone, TalkBack on an Android device, or JAWS on a computer?
4. Are you able to join the Zoom session using this assistive technology?
5. Please list the name of the assistive technology or software you will use during the session.
6. We want to make sure our website works for people with various levels of experience with screen readers. Please rate your experience level using a screen reader:
[Response options: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert]

## Timeline
The Research Plan will be completed by (TBD). We would like to schedule sessions for the week of (TBD).

### Prepare

**TBD**

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: Angela Fowler | angela.fowler@adhocteam.us
* Date and time of pilot session: TBD

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: TBD

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1.5 hours
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 minutes 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 3

### Availability
TBD
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
