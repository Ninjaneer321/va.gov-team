# Claim Status Tool: Research plan

This doc outlines our research needs for the Claim Status Tool. 
By Christian Valla. Benefits and Memorials 1.

## Project background

The Claim Status Tool was launched approximately 3 years ago and only minor changes have been done since. The claim status tool is a priority to improve, as it is used frequently by millions of veterans (it is not uncommon for veterans to check their claim status several times a week). We see this as an opportunity to create a great user experience for veterans using and depending on this tool.
Very little research has been done on the claim status tool. What has been done is shared here:  [research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/claim-appeal-status)

This project will use a "blue sky" approach and look broadly at what such a tool can do, and what additional business goals it can serve. 

## Product questions

Learn more about: 
- What research and recommendations already exist?
- What can be learned from other companies and organizations about claim / status tracking and tracking tools?
- What expectations do users have towards tracking tools in general?
- What are the current use cases within the current claim status tool?
- What are the pain points and limitations of the current tool?
- What is working well with the current tool?
- How can the current tool be improved?
- Understand what users need and want from such a tool. What would they like to accomplish within the tool, that they can't accomplish now?
- Collaborate with veterans to understand what they would like to see in such a tool. Understand how they would prioritize features, use cases in the tool.


How to create a better Claim Status Tool:
- How can the claim status tool be redefined, to create a better experience for veterans?
- Investigate how the new claims tool can be pushed further, and look for not only better user experiences, but potentially broaden the scope and possibilities of such a tool. Could the new tool expedite additional use cases?
- Investigate how this tool can integrate with other parts of VA.gov, especially with regards to the revamp of the content pages (communicate with Liz Lantz).
- Understand how the new claim status tool can best expedite the relevant use cases in an efficient and elegant way.


## Research needs

We would like to propose a research process consisting of 6 steps:

1. A previous research review, including a detailed mapping of the current tool and its use cases, as well as any existing quantitative and qualitative research.
2. A comparative analysis to learn how other organizations and companies are handling status (claim) tracking.
3. Quantitative analysis of the current claim status tool data. 
4. A combined research session: a short usability test of the existing Claim status tool and a Collaborative Design Session with veterans. 
5. Concept testing of new Claim Status Tool.
6. Usability testing of new Claim Status Tool. 


### 1. Previous research review (completed)

Approximately 2-3 days of work

We'd like to go through all previous, relevant qualitative and quantitative research, to learn from it and make sure we are not duplicating research.                                 
Previous research: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/claim-appeal-status
  
### 2. Comparative analysis of status tracking tools (completed)

Approximately 2-3 days of work

We want to understand better what a claim status tool can be, new possibilities for good user experiences, and possible new business opportunities. We will do a comparative analysis, learn about how other companies and organizations and handle claims, status tracking, progress updates etc. 


### 3. Quantitative analysis (completed)

Approximately 2-3 days of work

Investigate data such as:

- How many claims, on average, does a user have within the claim status tool?
- What call center data can we collect for the claim status tool? What were people calling in about?
- What are the most prevalent types of documents uploaded in the 'additional evidence' tool?
- When users exit the CST, where do they go?
- How do users enter the CST? What page(s) do they come from?


### 4. Usability test of current claim status tool + Collaborative Design Session (planning / recruiting) 

Approximately 6-7 days of work

Usability:
- What are the use cases for the current claims tool?
- What expectations do users have for the claims tool?
- How is the current tool meeting these expectations?
- What are the usability issues and pain points?
- What is working well with the current tool?

Colloborative design sessions
- What would make a claim status tool more useful?
- What are the user needs and wants for a claim status tool?
- What would they like to see in such a tool?
- What actions would they like to be able to take here? 
- What info is most important for users? 
- What are their expectations towards a Claim Status Tool in 2021? 
- How do they expect to see their info presented in such a tool?
- What are the 5 most important use cases for veterans within such a tool?


### 5. Concept testing of new Claim status tool (planning)

Approximately 7 days of work

- Test early concepts of a new claim status tool.
What is working and what is not?
What other opportunities lie within this tool?
- Usability testing of the new claim status tool.


### 6. Usability testing of new Claim status tool (planning)

Approximately 7 days of work

- Test prototype of a new Claim status tool.  



## Methods

- Previous research review
- Competitive analysis
- Quantitative analysis
- Usability test + Collaborative design session (remote, zoom)
- Concept test (remote, zoom)
- Usability test (remote, zoom)



## Next steps

- Complete a previous research / work review. (Completed)
- Complete a comparative analysis. (Completed)
- Do a quantitative analysis. (Completed)
- Recruit participants for usability study of current tools. (- Make sure the claim status tool can be tested in staging. (?))
- Create a conversation guide/script for the usability test of the current tool.
- Execute usability study of current tools.
- Recruit participants for concept testing of new tool ideas.
- Create prototype for new claims tool.
- Write a conversation guide for concept testing.
- Concept testing of new claim status tool.
- Recruit participants for usability study of new claims tools.
- Create prototype and conversation guide.
- Conduct a usability test of new claims tools.
- Synthesize research


## Research synthesis

- A report that summarizes the Previous Research Review and the Competitive analysis.
- A report from any quantitative analysis.
- A report from the usability test of the current claim status tool.
- A report from early concept testing of new claim status tool sketches / ideas.
