## Research Goals
With this research we hope to learn how well our designs solve the comprehension problems that exist for Veterans around the claim process. We hope to learn how useful this type of informational content would be for Veterans who are filing disability compensation claims on VA.gov. Which aspects specifically do Veterans find useful (or not)?

## Research Questions

- How do Veterans react to this content? Do they find it useful?
- Does this new design set the right expectation for how the claim will move between claim steps? Do Veterans understand why and how the claim might move back and forth between certain claim steps?
- After seeing this design, do Veterans feel like they understand what is happening at each step of the process? How do they feel after seeing this information?

## Methodology 

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
- Veterans will find value in the information provided in the new Overview tab and will prefer it to the more basic "process list" design.
   - DEFINITELY TRUE: 10 of 14 veterans prefered the new Overveiw tab design on the process list design
- Veterans will have a good understanding of generally what happens at each step of the process (they don't need to understand every little detail).
   - MAYBE TRUE: Many veterans had a general idea of each step, but some were unsure about key details.
- Veterans will understand that it is normal for claims to go back and forth between steps.
   - DEFINITELY TRUE: most veterans understood that it is normal for claims to go back and forth between steps.
- Veterans will find that the new timeline provides a detailed picture of what is happening with a claim.
   - DEFINITELY TRUE: Most veterans found value with having a timeline; some mentioned it reduced their level of anxiety.

## Key Findings

1. Most participants said they prefer the new overview page design over the current design.

2. Participants appreciated the estimated time feature; it seems to be one of their favorite parts of the new design.

3. Participants desire specific information regarding their claims, rather than solely relying on a general overview of the claims process.

4. Most people understood what the graphics is communicating

5. Two personas emerged over the course of the research sessions: some participants preferred the extra details while others wanted less.

6. We observed that certain participants were confused by specific aspects of the content.


## Details of Findings 

**1. Most participants said they prefer the new overview page design over the current design.**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool

When asked during the study, we found that *10 of 14* participants preferred the new design. Most of which attributed the decision to the level of detail in the content. (Note: Participant 1 was not counted for this question because they were having internet issues, we weren’t able to get their feedback on that question.)

On a scale of 1 to 5 (one being the lowest), veterans rated the helpfulness and level of detail of the new design as 4.5 and 4.8 respectively. Compared to the current design (control) which average scores 3.8 and 3.7. 

> _Prefers the prototype "More detail...and it had that really great diagram. - P6_

> _I prefer to know that it can move back…in this version (control) it can stay in Step 3 for months and make a person feel frustrated...in the other one someone has their eyes on it. - P14_


**2. Participants appreciated the estimated time feature; it seems to be one of their favorite parts of the new design.**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool 

Participants found solace seeing the estimated timeline for each step in combination with the date when the step began. It helped set expectations on how long an individual step will take. A few veterans hinted that this feature reduces their need to call VA to inquire about their claim being “stuck”.

> _with the current (control design), I would call VA often, because i want to know why my claim hasn't moved - P2_

> _… time frame, that's super important - P12_

> _… But what I liked on the previous page again, was kind of like that. It was very upfront like, Hey, this! This should only take one to 2 days. And then it was more detailed. Right? - P11_


**3. Participants desire specific information regarding their claims, rather than solely relying on a general overview of the claims process.**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool

In our study, we found that most Veterans found the general overview content helpful. However, when their claims went backward, they wanted to know why specifically. Some were frustrated because they didn't know the exact reasons, especially when the site said, "Nothing is needed from you."

Some veterans wanted to see a checklist of evidence needed by the VA to assess their claim. They asked two questions: What evidence is missing, and what can they do to expedite the process? If the issue lies with VA staff, they wanted to know what happened.

**4. Most people understood what the graphics is communicating**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool

The steps diagram and repeat symbols in the accordion clarified that some steps might repeat during the claims process. Some people used the graphic to anticipate when these steps would occur again while reviewing claim details.

> _[Diagram] 8 step process and it shows 3-6 potential revolving.  understanding overtime the step can go backwards. from 6 to 3, 4 to 3 etc. - P18_

> _[Graphic]: Represents the number of steps and shows the step that repeats. - P8_

**5. Two personas emerged over the course of the research sessions: some participants preferred the extra details while others wanted less.**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool

During the study, participants had the opportunity to compare the new designs to the current (control design). We realized a divide in the participants, where some appreciated having the extra details about each step in the claim. Others felt like there was too much information and that it wasn't particularly useful.

- Most of the participants appreciated having extra detail, 11 out of 14. 
   > _Because if I logged on and saw this today and I saw all this info, It would take away all the anxiety I have._
   
   > _I would give it a 5; compared to eBenefits, this is way more detailed. I would highly rate it. Any questions I’d want someone to answer, it’s already here. Everything has been explained, the verbiage is very direct. Compared to what we had before in eBenefits._
- Participants who preferred fewer details had different reasons for their preference.
   > _found herself jumping around alot to find information. - P13_

   > _I like this is better (referring to control design), it’s simple...cuts all the jargon down. - P17_
   > _I Feels content on mobile device should be concise, but on desktop, it's OK to have more because of screen real estate - P13_

**6. We observed that certain participants were confused by specific aspects of the content.**

Labels: BNFT: Disability, Claims Status, PRDT: Claim-status-tool

Although most participants in this group understood the essence of what the graphics were communicating they were confused about what that might look like in reality.
- A participant thought the claim could jump from step 3 to 6 if all the evidence were received.
   > _I'm guessing maybe if you are step 3 you can skip to step 6 but if they don't have everything to make a decision they can go back to step 3. - P13_

- When looking at the repeat callout inside the accordion, some people weren’t sure which step the box was referring to.
   > _ That would be confusing because... what step are they referring to?_

- Some participants didn’t understand how a step repeating will affect the timeline.  
   > _… does the time estimate start over or does it continue with the time left. - P2_

   > _out of 8 steps, it might have to turn into 11 steps if they repeat… - P10_
- Participants were uncertain when they can add evidence
  > _He wants a line to tell him when he's allowed to add evidence and when there's no additional evidence allowed. - P12_

## Secondary Finding
- Participants expressed concerns that Veterans who are less tech-savvy might struggle to use the tool.
- Veterans desired an interactive steps diagram or one that highlights the current step in their claim.
- Most people found that the status page provided sufficient information about their claim. We believe this meets the need for people who prefer fewer details.
