## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Skyler/Gary], and I'm going to be guiding you through the session today. I'm on a team that works with the VA on the VA.gov website. Today we're going to talk about disability compensation claims and the Claim Status Tool.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

## First Task: CST Home Page - 5 minutes

So let's say you are signed into your VA.gov account and you're looking at this page. You submitted a claim a month ago, and you're logging in to check and see if there's been an update.

- Do you know what this page is? If yes, what is it?
- Describe to me what you're seeing here.
- Let's say you're waiting for this top claim to be decided. What would you say is the status of the claim, based on what you see here? (Point them towards "Step 3 of 8: Evidence gathering" if they don't reference it themselves.) And what does that status mean to you? 

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant recognize the Claim Status Tool?
- Do they recognize which claim is in progress?
- How accurate is their understanding of the status based only on what they see here?

## Second Task: Status Page - 5 minutes

[Have the participant click "View details" on the in-progress claim]

- Tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)
- Do you feel like this tells you everything you need to know about the claim? Why or why not?
- If you wanted to upload evidence to your claim, what would you do?

### Things to watch for:

- How do Veterans react to the Status tab in general?
- Do Veterans read the recent activity section and find it important
- Do Veterans know what to do if they wanted to add files to their claim online?
  
## Third Task: Files Page - 10 minutes

[Participant clicks into the Files tab]

- Now tell me what you see here. (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)
- Is there anything that is particularly useful about what you see here?
- Is there anything that is particularly confusing about what you see here?
- What steps would you take to add a file to your claim?

### Things to watch for:

- What content on the page is most useful to the Veteran? Least helpful or confusing?
- Do Veterans read the document files section and find it important

## Fourth Task: Confirmation message for successful file uplaod - 10 minutes

[Participant completes the Files upload]

- Now tell me what you see here.
- If we were not here, what would be your next step? (Prompt them to scroll up and down.)
- What do you think this card is (refering to the submission in progress card)?
- Can you describe the relationship between the confirmation message and the "submission in progress" card?
- What do you think will happen in a couple days after seeing this card?

[Click on the submnission in progress card to see the file has now be added to the e-folder]

- Question 2
- Any questions for me? 

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
