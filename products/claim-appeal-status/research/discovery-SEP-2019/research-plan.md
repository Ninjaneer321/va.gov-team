# Research Plan

Unicorns, Claim Status Tool, September 2019

## Goals
- The primary goal of this research is to understand where Veterans expect to be able to file an appeal on VA.gov. 
- The secondary goal is to understand how Veterans are using the Claim Staus tool and discover opportunities to improve their experiences.

### Background
Veterans are using the Claim Status tool to submit their Decision Review forms. This creates a problem because the forms get stored in the eFolder, without an EP code for tracking and does not notify anyone of their existence. Therefore, Decision Review form could go unnoticed indefinitely. This issue was identified during a conversation with RVSR (rater inside VA).

We're unable to find data that helps us understand how frequently this issue is happening. Therefore, we're doing this research learn more about where Veterans expect to be able to file appeals on VA.gov and how we might improve the current Claim Status tool so that appeal forms are not uploaded there.

### Research questions
- Where would Veterans expect to be able to file an appeal on VA.gov?
- How are Veterans are using the Claim Staus tool? 
  - How do they feel about it? 
  - Does it have the information that Veterans need?
  - Is the information clear and easy to understand?
  - What types of files do they expect to be able to upload there? 
  - What do they expect to happen after they upload evidence?
  - Would they consider uploading a document that is not evidence in the Claim Status tool? If so, why?

### Hypotheses
- Veterans are using the Claim Status tool to submit Decision Review forms because there isn't a better way to submit them on VA.gov.
- There are opportunities to improve the Claim Status tool and appeals content on VA.gov to help Veterans easily understand the process. 

## Method
- We are identifying how many Veterans are submitting Decision Review forms on the Claim Status tool by identifying the number of documents in the eFolder that have:
  - form numbers (20-0095, 20-0096)
  - no EP codes

- We are identifying the volume of calls to the Contact Center about submitting Decision Reviews on VA.gov.

- We are using remote, moderated usability studies because we need to talk to Veterans to understand where they expect to be able to file appeals on VA.gov. 

- We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.
  
- We will ask Veterans to log in to VA.gov and share their screens with us via Zoom. 


## Participants
- 6-8 Veterans
- Must have one of the following accounts: DSLogon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me
- Must have filed a disability claim or appealed a disability decision

## Recruitment
