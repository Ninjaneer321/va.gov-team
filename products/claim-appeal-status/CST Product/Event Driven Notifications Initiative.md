# Notification Feature Initiative

## Executive Summary
The Notification Feature Initiative aims to introduce an event-driven architecture into the VA notification ecosystem. This initiative will enable different teams to communicate with a unified voice, leveraging the same events. The infrastructure will be managed by the CST team, which owns the claim status problem space. The initiative is about addressing communication gaps and will also pave the way for a future where VA's interaction with veterans is more integrated and proactive. By setting up an event-driven architecture, we're laying the foundation for various teams to seamlessly send push notifications, text alerts, provide on-site notifications, and other digital experiences all from a unified platform. This forward-thinking approach ensures that as veterans' needs and technologies evolve, our communication methods can adapt swiftly, maintaining consistency and reliability in how we inform and engage with veterans.
