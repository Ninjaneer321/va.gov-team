# Process for Updating Evidence Requests with Plain Language

## Prepare
### 1. Check the tracking spreadsheet
Open the [Evidence Request Tracking Spreadsheet] in SharePoint to see the status of all evidence requests. This shows which ones are already updated and which still need plain language.
### 2. (Optional) Prioritize updates
To focus on the ones most used by Veterans, sort the spreadsheet by Log count.
### 3. Find requests that need updates
If the “Content status” column is blank or says “On hold,” the request still needs plain language.
### 4. Get details from experts
Open the [VA.gov Evidence Request Content Worksheet] in SharePoint. Use it to collect details from subject matter experts, such as:
- Type of request (first-party or third-party)
- What VA is asking for
- What steps the Veteran should take
- Any other important information
## Draft
### 5. Create the design mockup
Once the worksheet is complete, create a Figma mockup of the evidence request with the new plain language content.
### 6. (Optional) Share with SME for review
Send a screenshot of the mockup to the subject matter expert for feedback.
### 7. Make edits if needed
Update the mockup with any changes from the review.
## Review
### 8. Get final approval
Request a content and design review from the Design Lead.
## Publish
### 9. Submit for implementation
After approval, ask an engineer to add the changes to staging.va.gov.
### 10. Review and go live
Check the staging site for accuracy and quality. When it’s ready, give the go-ahead to publish on the live site.
