# Plan for the Next Iteration of Continuous Discovery
Continuous Discovery makes the process of gathering Veteran feedback more frequent and lightweight so that Veteran voices are more present in design and product decisions. 

For this next round of Continuous Discovery we are incorporating learnings from the pilot to refine our approach, balancing access to Veterans with important fundamentals like strategic decision-making and thorough documentation.

We have several topics that we plan to test with Veterans, including adding disabled dependents to Veterans' disability compensation benefit, adding inactive dependents to picklist, and testing the content of the 0969 combined form. Flexibility is integral to the Continuous Discovery process so the topics we research, and the order in which we research them, may change as new priorities arise. We also have a research backlog which includes potential Continuous Discovery research topics.

Time allotted for each stage:
- 2 days - decide on topic
- 5 days - prep
- 3 days - conduct research
- 5 days- analysis
- Cohorts do not overlap

Other changes:

* Before CD kicks off again, review research backlog and mark which ones might be a good fit for CD
* Recruit seven Veterans each round instead of five
* Use the topline summary template to record findings, add next steps to it
