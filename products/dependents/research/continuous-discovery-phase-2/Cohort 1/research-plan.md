	# Research Plan for Lifestage, Dependents Management, February 2026]

## Background 🏗️
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Dependents Management allows Veterans to manage the dependents on their disability compensation benefit. Specifically, the team is working on the functionality that allow Veterans keep dependents on the benefit when they turn 18 if they are students or disabled dependents, or add them back to the benefit if they have been removed but still meet the eligibility criteria. The process of accessing these forms digitally is currently very unintuitive.**
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov?`

**Authenticated experience**
  
`What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**Iteration on existing functionality**

`Product Brief`

**N/A**

`Objective 3: Relentlessly improve the user experience.`

> - **Key Result 3.1:** Each OIT portfolio will improve customer satisfaction (or similar measure of user experience quality) of impactful systems by 3% or more.
  - ***Research Ops Plain Language:** Supports this product’s OIT portfolio (Health, Benefits, etc) in improving customer satisfaction (or similar measure of user experience quality) of impactful systems by 3% or more.*

> - **Key Result 3.3:** 100% of C-100 systems have delivered at least one release that directly addresses a documented user pain point with that system.
  - ***Research Ops Plain Language:** Supports the delivery of at least one release that directly addresses a documented user pain point within this product.*

## Research Goals 🥅	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **Understand if the new design makes the process of keeping dependents on the disability compensation benefit after age 18 as student dependents or disabled dependents easier for participants**

`2.` **Understand if the new design makes the process of adding back student dependents or disabled dependents who were previously on the disability compensation benefit but were removed easier for participants**

`3.` **Understand if the new design of the upload page makes it more intuitive for participants** 
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**The feedback will help us make accessing these these necessary forms more intuitive for Veterans.** 

---

### Research questions

**`1.`Do participants understand how to start the process of keeping a dependent on the disability compensation benefit past their 18th birthday as a disabled or student dependent?**

**`2.`Do participant understand how to start the process of adding back inactive dependents?**

**`3.`Do participants understand that they can submit the form without uploading documents?**


### Hypotheses

---

**1. The new design for keeping and adding back dependents will be easier for participants to navigate.** 
**2. The majority of participants will want to upload documents before they submit the form.**

---
