## Continuous Discovery Research Findings- Round One
#### August 21-25, 2025


### Participants
- 3 Veterans
- All received disability compensation benefits and had dependents on their disability benefit
     - Dependents included children, spouses, and parents

### Experience Adding and Removing Dependents
- Veterans had added these dependents to their disability benefit
- None had had to manually remove a dependent
- When asked why they might need to remove a dependent, participants consistently mentioned divorce or death. One person mentioned disability.
- One person had had a child removed when they turned 18, but they didn't get any notice that this was going to happen. They only realized when the check they received was less than usual.
     - When two Veterans were asked how they would like to be notified that their child was going to be removed from the benefit when they turned 18, they mentioned they would like to be notified in several ways (email, letter) and be notified in advance

### Dependent Verification
- None of the participants remember being asked to verify their dependents
     - One Veteran added their first dependent in approximately 2009, another in approximately 2017, don't know the timeline for the third Veteran
- When asked what they thought dependent verification meant, all participants said the documentation that they provided when adding the dependents
     - For example, a birth certificate or a marriage license
- One person did later talk about VA making sure that their dependents were still accurate, and how this is something he was comfortable with, and he did use verification in this context
- When asked how would you explain the reason for verifying dependents to another Veteran,  When asked how they would explain the reason for verifying dependence, veterans said.

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:18.417
The veterans we spoke with clearly understood that dependents were tied.

00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:26.051
To payments. So when dependents were added.

00:04:28.191 --> 00:04:34.191
Their disability benefit payment was higher, and when they were removed, the payment was lower.

00:04:33.937 --> 00:04:39.937
They also understood that if they're paid too much, they'll need to pay it back.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.570
Two suggested or assumed… This could be waived in certain circumstances.

00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:02.829
Two requested that they be notified of overpayments by letter. Open parentheses, one mentioned specifically a certified letter.

00:05:07.865 --> 00:05:09.865
Because… it would.

00:05:14.748 --> 00:05:16.748
They would be… more likely to notice it. Close parentheses.

00:05:23.275 --> 00:05:25.275
When asked… We're on VA.gov.

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:32.459
They would expect to view their dependents.

00:05:39.867 --> 00:05:41.867
The veterans responded.

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:47.959
There's a tab button for this. In the claims section of VA.gov, comma.

00:05:53.373 --> 00:05:56.373
Wishes it was still on MHV. Quote on the first page she lands on, quote.

00:06:06.404 --> 00:06:10.404
When asked what their ideal removal process would be. If one of their dependents died.

00:06:17.006 --> 00:06:20.006
Open parentheses. None of them had… experienced… this, and they did not have.

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.180
Designs in front of them.

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:39.659
So we were asking them to imagine, close parentheses. Short process, comma, phone number to call that walks.

00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:47.899
Them through it. Have the VA contact me and handle the removal.

00:06:54.666 --> 00:06:56.666
Open parentheses. Wasn't entirely clear how the VA would know to contact.

00:07:01.227 --> 00:07:04.227
This veteran, close parentheses. Quote about deleting the person from their life.

00:07:09.013 --> 00:07:14.013
Va would understand if they didn't remove the deceased veteran. From their disability benefit immediately.

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:24.210
When asked about their ideal process or what they would change if they had a magic wand.

00:07:28.632 --> 00:07:32.632
More contact, proactive contact. By VA.

00:07:41.216 --> 00:07:43.216
Within firm… Open parentheses, you don't know what you don't know, close parentheses.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:04.896
Straightforward, open parentheses, a Scantron can verify them, close parentheses. Wants it all to be…

00:08:07.633 --> 00:08:09.633
Online.
