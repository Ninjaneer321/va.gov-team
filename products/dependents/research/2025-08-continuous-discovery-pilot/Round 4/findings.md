key_findings:
  - "4 of them had spouses as dependents"
  - "2 of them had children as dependents"
  - "2 of them had verified their dependents before"
  - "2 said they had been asked by VA to verify information but this was after or while they were in the process of making changes to their dependents so I don't think that they were the traditional 8-year verification requests"
  - "3 of 5 said that they did not looked at their dependent information unless VA requested it"
  - "1 said that they saw their dependent information once a year in a letter that VA sends to them"
  - "3 of 5 mentioned or gave examples of how they were very security conscious"
  - "Design A (Please confirm): mandatory, made them concerned, including the title of the form made it seem more official, the subject also added weight, seemed like a request but in a 'I recommend that you take care of this... Definitely more... you need to do this', Important to do because it affects benefits"
  - "Design B (Dependent re-verification needed): 'this one gives me anxiety', specifically the references to overpayment and paying money back, headline is 'self-explanatory', gives necessary information about what would happen if you don't take action, did not seem required to some, seemed 'open ended' on the severity or importance of the task"
  - "Design C (Need you to verify): prefers the language- 'less harsh', seems optional but might not receive compensation, 'doesn't expressly say this is required' but he would still check his dependents right away, title draws attention, advising is stronger language than recommend or request"
  - "Design Preference varied: DV needed 'short and to the point', tells why it is important, add language about how this is routine; Headline from please confirm (says this is important, why it is important, and 'what the action is'); Need you to verify but add the plain language form title and say 'Need' if VA wants them to do it"
recommendations:
  - "Add language about how verification is routine to reduce concern that VA thinks they are lying"
  - "Include form title to make message seem more official"
  - "Balance urgency language with clarity about consequences"
  - "Consider using 'Need' language if VA requires action"
  - "Keep messages short and to the point while explaining importance"

##Participant Demographics
- 5 Veterans
    
- 4 of them had spouses as dependents
- 2 of them had children as dependents

- 2 of them had verified their dependents before
- 2 said they had been asked by VA to verify information but this was after or while they were in the process of making changes to their dependents so I don't think that they were the traditional 8-year verification requests

- 3 of 5 said that they did not looked at their dependent information unless VA requested it
- 1 said that they saw their dependent information once a year in a letter that VA sends to them
- the final participant said that they had recently reviewed their dependent information in a dedicated spot in the VA app, to our knowledge the dependent information isn't in the app, it may be in some letters in the app

- 3 of 5 mentioned or gave examples of how they were very security conscious


## Feedback

### Design A (Please confirm)
- mandatory
- made them concerned (add that this is routine, VA is not sending you this because they think you are lying)

- mandatory
- if you don't complete it you will lose benefits
- no concerns

- "Action seems to be more pertinent . . . It sounds more like it's saying, are these the correct dependents? Are these really your dependents?"
- Including the title of the form made it seem more official
- The subject also added weight
- Seemed like a request but in a "I recommend that you take care of this. . . . Definitely more . . . you need to do this"
- Important to do because it affects benefits
- He is not concerned

- Mandatory if you want to keep receiving benefits

- No concerns raised by the message


### Design B (Dependent re-verification meeded)
- "this one gives me anxiety", specifically the references to overpayment and paying money back
- seems optional but you might not get paid

- headline is "self-explanatory"
- gives necessary information about what would happen if you don't take action

- did not seem required, seemed like a reminder
- seemed "open ended" on the severity or importance of the task

- Mandatory
  
- Not very urgent
- No concerns raised by the message


### Design C (Need you to verify)

- prefers the language- "less harsh"
- seems optional but might not receive compensation
- "doesn't expressly say this is required" but he would still check his dependents right away

- no concerns
- mandatory or your check will be decreased

- Title draws attention
- Advising is stronger language than recommend or request
- Giving this reason why they should verify might make people respond more quickly

- Doesn't include that they could lose money, thinks that this is important to include

- the importance that advise converys isn't very urgent
- No concerns raised by the message
  

### Design Preference: 
- DV needed "short and to the point", tells why it is important, add language about how this is routine
- Headline from please confirm (says this is important, why it is important, and "what the action is"
- Need you to verify but add the plain language form title and say "Need" if VA wants them to do it
- No preference, depends on the person
- No preference, it is "all about the correcgt amount whether they say it or not"
