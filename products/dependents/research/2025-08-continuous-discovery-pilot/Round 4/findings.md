##Participant Demographics
- 5 Veterans
    
- 4 of them had spouses as dependents
- 2 of them had children as dependents

- 2 of them had verified their dependents before
- 2 said they had been asked by VA to verify information but this was after or while they were in the process of making changes to their dependents so I don't think that they were the traditional 8-year verification requests

- 3 of 5 said that they did not looked at their dependent information unless VA requested it
- 1 said that they saw their dependent information once a year in a letter that VA sends to them
- the final participant said that they had recently reviewed their dependent information in a dedicated spot in the VA app, to our knowledge the dependent information isn't in the app, it may be in some letters in the app

- 3 of 5 mentioned or gave examples of how they were very security conscious


## Feedback

### Design A (Please confirm)
- mandatory
- made them concerned (add that this is routine, VA is not sending you this because they think you are lying)

- mandatory
- if you don't complete it you will lose benefits
- no concerns

- "Action seems to be more pertinent . . . It sounds more like it's saying, are these the correct dependents? Are these really your dependents?"
- Including the title of the form made it seem more official
- The subject also added weight
- Seemed like a request but in a "I recommend that you take care of this. . . . Definitely more . . . you need to do this"
- Important to do because it affects benefits
- He is not concerned

- Mandatory if you want to keep receiving benefits

- No concerns raised by the message


### Design B (Dependent re-verification meeded)
- "this one gives me anxiety", specifically the references to overpayment and paying money back
- seems optional but you might not get paid

- headline is "self-explanatory"
- gives necessary information about what would happen if you don't take action

- did not seem required, seemed like a reminder
- seemed "open ended" on the severity or importance of the task

- Mandatory
  
- Not very urgent
- No concerns raised by the message


### Design C (Need you to verify)

- prefers the language- "less harsh"
- seems optional but might not receive compensation
- "doesn't expressly say this is required" but he would still check his dependents right away

- no concerns
- mandatory or your check will be decreased

- Title draws attention
- Advising is stronger language than recommend or request
- Giving this reason why they should verify might make people respond more quickly

- Doesn't include that they could lose money, thinks that this is important to include

- the importance that advise converys isn't very urgent
- No concerns raised by the message
  

### Design Preference: 
- DV needed "short and to the point", tells why it is important, add language about how this is routine
- Headline from please confirm (says this is important, why it is important, and "what the action is"
- Need you to verify but add the plain language form title and say "Need" if VA wants them to do it
- No preference, depends on the person
- No preference, it is "all about the correcgt amount whether they say it or not"
