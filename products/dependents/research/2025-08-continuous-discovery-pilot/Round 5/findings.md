# Participants
We spoke with 4 Veterans.  
  
**Veteran 2**  
- Wife, mother, and two child dependents
- One child dependent who used disability dependent student benefit while dependent was still in high school, may use it again after their GI Bill benefits run out
  
**Veteran 3**
- College student dependent using GI benefit, used disability dependent student benefit while dependent was still in high school
- Also has a dependent in high school
  
**Veteran 4**
- One dependent between the age of 18 and 23, had previously used disability student benefit but did not know that it could not be used at the same time as Chapter 35 so ended up having an overpayment, dependent had left college but planned to return and Veteran thought that once they stopped using the student benefit they could not reapply
- Mentioned another child but did not talk about them being a student
  
**Veteran 5**
- Has an elementary-school-aged child

## School form experience
  
**Veteran 2**
- Doesn't remember the process of adding a student
  
**Veteran 3**
- Learned about disability student benefit from VSO who helped them on original disability application
- Finding out what they needed to do online was hard, they searched on VA.gov and tried typing in dependent (went to dependents), student (went to GI bill) 
- Couldn't figure out the right form, ended up calling VA and a person told them what form to fill out, when they called back with additional questions/difficulties someone filled it out over the phone and submitted it electronically for him
- Found the school calendar online to validate high school graduation date
- Shared that they have to validate the class start and end date each year, will not get paid for the summer when dependent is out of school, and dependent needed to be taking a certain amount of credits- these may be true for the GI Bill but we do not believe these are true of the disability student benefit
  
**Veteran 4**
- Submitted the paperwork on VA.gov
- Could not find answers to some of their questions online, it was all verbal
- Got different answers from the call center about if dependents could use Chapter 35 and disability student benefits at once
- After about a year of having both benefits the student was removed from the disability benefit by VA and had to repay
  
**Veteran 5**
- Has not added a student to their disability benefit
