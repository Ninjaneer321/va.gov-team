## Initial Findings
These findings are an analysis of the answers participants gave to pre-study, prototype, and post-study questions. The pre-study and post-study findings group answers from participants who viewed Designs A and B together. The prototype question analysis is broken down into the two designs.


### Pre-study questions

#### How often do you view the dependents on your benefits on VA.gov? 
- 18 of the 19 participants had viewed their dependents on VA.gov
- 3	viewed their dependents when a situation calls for it
     - "Only at time of set up to make sure they are there."
     - "Recently I divorced and was checking weekly until that status was reflected in my account as well."
     - "Only when my rating went over 30%."
- 3	viewed their dependents monthly
- 7	viewed their dependents one to two times a year
- 3	viewed their dependents occasionally
- 4	viewed their dependents once
- 1	misunderstood the question

#### When was the last time you viewed the dependents on your benefits on VA.gov?
- 18 of the 19 participants had viewed their dependents on VA.gov
- 3	viewed their dependents in the previous week
- 6	viewed their dependents in the previous month
- 5	viewed their dependents in the previous year
- 3	viewed their dependents more than a year ago
- 1 was unsure

#### What causes you to view the dependents on your disability benefit on VA.gov? 
- 18 of the 19 participants had viewed their dependents on VA.gov, 1 mentioned both checking and benefits
- 14	said to check or verify the information
- 4	 mention benefits and benefits other than disability compensation
- 1	 said the DV letter


### Post-study questions

#### Did this prototype change your understanding of dependent verification? If so, how?
- 6	said Yes
     - "yes, it was helpful"
     - "Yes, the whole process is clear and logical and without the usual VA jargon and endless VA forms to wade through."
     - "Yes but it needs some work based on my recording feedback. for simple cases like a child is mine for 18 years I dont want to go through this every year..or not be required to go thru it every year."
     - "Yes. it provided step by step instructions for how to verify, how to update information, and how to add or remove dependents due any life changes, (divorce, marriage, or age)."
     - "Yes, I previously had not paid attention to the ID number of an  incomplete application. I was also unaware of the verbiage "became a caregiver of a parent" to which I would anticipate this action to apply to becoming a caregiver of any adult."
     - "Yes. Helped guide me through the process. It also streamlines the process."
- 11 said No, primarily because they were already familiar with the information or process
- 2	responses are unclear
