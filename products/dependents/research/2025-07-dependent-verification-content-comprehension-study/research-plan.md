	# Research Plan for Dependent Management Team, Dependent Verification update, July 2025

## Background üèóÔ∏è
<summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

**Currently, the VA overpays $250 million in dependent benefits each year. If a Veteran is overpaid a benefit, they are required to re-pay the overpayment back to the VA. Updating dependency information outside the 8-year requirement is voluntary, and the burden of remembering to make dependency updates falls on the Veteran. Verifying dependents through a paper form is also burdensome for many Veterans. These problems result in a very low-quality feedback loop for maintaining an accurate list of what dependents are intended to be on the award. Our goal is to decrease the over- and under-payment amount for dependent-related benefits by allowing Veterans to quickly and easily verify their dependents on VA.gov.**
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**The Dependent Verification flow that we are testing begins on the "Your VA dependents" page; this page can only be accessed when the Veteran has signed into VA.gov.**
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

**This flow is an update to existing functionality. Updates include:**
- **Enhancements to the view dependents page that will allow Veterans to see additional info for each dependent**
- **Adding a question to the view dependents page that asks Veterans if their dependent information has changed. VA.gov will automatically generate a 21-0538 form, ask the Veteran to review the info, sign a statement of truth, and then submit the 21-0538 form. If necessary, they will also be directed to fill out the add/remove dependents form on VA.gov (21-686c/674)**

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

<summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support?</summary>

**This update will include improvements to the UI and backend functionality.**

`Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

`Objective 2: OCTO‚Äôs platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.

### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

<summary>Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter?</summary>
	
**Veterans could verify their dependents at many points in their journey but it is especially relevant to the `Putting Down Roots`stage. Dependents Verification involves the intersection of a Veteran's family and their VA benefits and this stage contains the "Starting, growing, or maintaining my family" and the "Engaging VA to access benefits and services" moments that matter.**


## Research Goals ü•Ö	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` **What type of content on the "Your VA dependents" page, especially in the alert box, is most effective in helping Veterans understand and complete the dependents verification process?**

`2.` **How is it most natural for Veterans to respond after reviewing the current state of the dependents on their benefits?**
- **By indicating Yes they need to make changes or No they do not need to make changes**
- **OR by indicating Yes the current information is correct or No the current information is not correct**

`3.` **Do Veterans understand that if they need to make changes to the dependents on their VA benefits they will need to fill out an additional form after completing this flow?** 
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**The findings will be used to update the content in the dependents verification flow to help Veterans understand and complete the process. Verifying dependents decreases the amount of over- and under-payments for dependent-related benefits** 

---

### Research questions

***Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:***
	
`What will I do with what I learn from this question? Does this question serve the goals of my study?`

**Goal 1: What type of content on the "Your VA dependents" page, especially in the alert box, is most effective in helping Veterans understand and complete the dependents verification process?**
**(Some participants will be shown Design A and other participants will be shown Design B and their responses will be compared)**  

**`1.`After looking at this page what would you do next, if anything?**

**`2.`Is there any additional information you would like to see about your dependents to help you take the next step? If so, what?**

**Goal 2: What type of content on the "Your VA dependents" page, especially in the alert box, is most effective in helping Veterans understand and complete the dependents verification process?**
**(Some participants will be shown Design A and other participants will be shown Design B and their responses will be compared)**  

**`1.`If you see that a change needs to be made when reviewing your dependents, what would you do?**  

**Goal 3: Do Veterans understand that if they need to make changes to the dependents on their VA benefits they will need to fill out an additional form after completing this flow?** 
**(Some participants will be shown Design A and other participants will be shown Design B and their responses will be compared)**  

**`4.`[Enter Q4]**

**`5.`[Enter Q5]**


### Hypotheses
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to constrain the hypotheses to the goals of your study!
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don‚Äôt skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

---

**Content that emphasizes the risk of debt will make Veteran participants more likely to complete the process.**

**Veterans are most likely to abandon the task in the transition between the dependent verification flow and the additional forms.** 

---
  
## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è
***Describe the method you‚Äôre planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.*** 

**Unmoderated usability testing with additional survey questions**

## Recruitment üéØ	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*


### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 
- Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
- Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.
