## Research Goals
Veterans are mandated to verify their dependents' status every 8 years with VA Form 21-0538. This MVP is a partial digitization of this form for VA.gov and a call for Veterans to review and update or verify dependents annually to reduce the ~ $250 million per year of debt due to overpayments that Veterans accrue due to out-of-date dependents. This form follows the standard interview-style format on VA.gov and will be familiar to Veterans who use VA.gov to complete forms for their VA benefits. 

The purpose of this research was to 
1. Understand the Veteran’s mental model of dependent verification on VA.gov and their expectations for finding tools and completing tasks around dependent verification.
2. Validate the usability of our 0538 email notification and va.gov designs and determine whether they provide a clear path to verify and update dependents and
3. Understand how the flow, designs, and copy impact the Veteran’s understanding of the task.


## Research Questions

- How does the Veteran find dependent management info and tools on VA.gov?
- What actions and benefits do they associate with dependent management?
- How do Veterans expect to be able to accomplish tasks they associate with dependent management?

- Do directions and other informative language provide clarity or confusion?
- Do the designs allow most Veterans to verify their dependents in one sitting?
- Do we see indicators that a Veteran would take action immediately upon receiving the email?
  - Do they currently receive VA.gov notifications?
- What content or IA decisions might impede the Veteran from completing the task to verify? Update?

- Is the Veteran familiar with VA Form 0538?
- Does the Veteran’s mental model match the task they’re completing?
- Does the Veteran understand the impact of the dependency verification task?
- Do Veterans answer the yes/no question accurately and with clarity based on their dependents' situation.


## Methodology 

We conducted ten hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on February 10-14, 2025. Participants were asked a series of foundational questions regarding their experiences managing their dependents, specifically on VA.gov. They were then asked to engage with a Figma prototype representing the dependent verification experience on VA.gov. 

[Discussion guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/research/2025-02-dependents-verification-mvp-research/conversation-guide.md)
[Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/bvj72inycD0iZkuCbjYTWL/Dependent-Verification-MVP?page-id=704%3A13185&node-id=2218-77862&viewport=4550%2C30420%2C0.49&t=wyaR11IBNxWEvS5z-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2041%3A15449&show-proto-sidebar=1)

Each participant was shown the following: 

- An email notification from VA.gov that would be sent annually to direct Veterans to review and verify or update their dependents on VA.gov
- The verification experience, beginning on Your VA Dependents
  - The verification flow that ends with the Veteran submitting a VA Form 21-0538
  - The update flow that ends with the introduction page for the online tool, Request to add or remove VA dependents (VA Forms 21-686c and/or 21-674)
- The batch request letter for VA Form 21-0538 that Veterans currently receive on an 8-year cadence

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Most Veterans will be familiar with VA.gov notifications
    1. TRUE: Most participants already received notifications from VA.gov, though most of them were related to healthcare benefits (information about prescription refills, appointments, etc.) or newsletters. Participants were familiar with receiving notifications via text, email, mail, and via the app. 
1. Most Veterans will engage directly with the email notification
    1. TRUE: While some found the language “weak” or only saw the need to take action if one of the reasons to update applied to them, most would click the CTA or go to VA.gov directly “just to see” to review dependents.
1. Veterans will have clarity around the request, but may face lack of clarity with understanding the implications of the request
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Though most understood they were asked to review their dependents for accuracy and to update if needed, it’s not clear that participants associate “verification” with a form-related task. Half of participants were familiar with overpayments, hence with the benefit of keeping dependents up-to-date. However, it's unclear whether participants associate verification with fulfilling the 8-year mandate. There was some indication that participants would prefer to complete this task online for convenience. 
  
1. Veterans will use VA.gov’s search or benefits menu to find dependent management tools and information.
    1. LIKELY TRUE: Some participants would use search or the main menu. Others would look to the authenticated menu, an authenticated hub like MyVA, the top links on VA.gov, or would use the app to manage dependents. 
  
1. Most Veteran’s mental models will match the task to verify or update dependents.
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Veterans could complete the task, but it’s unclear whether participants understood the task's connection to the 8-year mandate. There was also some confusion around what "Update" means in regards to updating dependents in the MVP.
2. Most Veterans will understand that they must still respond to a paper 21-0538 request after completing the update or verify task on VA.gov (won’t disregard future paper requests)
     1. LIKELY FALSE: When prompted with receiving a paper 0538 after verifying on VA.gov caused confusion. Participants interpreted the 0538 batch letter as confirmation of verification on VA.gov or were confused/upset that they received this, seeing it as redundant. Many would call the VA to gain clarity. 
2. Veterans will understand the difference between the tasks to verify and update
    3. LIKELY TRUE: Most participants accurately followed the update/verify paths, with 2 even reading the description below the selection header. 
4. Veterans will expect to be able to edit, add, or remove individual dependents quickly
    5. DEFINITELY TRUE: Most participants expected to be able to update dependent information on VA.gov.  
6. Most Veterans will complete the dependency verification task with clarity and in one sitting.
    7. LIKELY TRUE: When following the happy path, most participants completed the task and described it as "quick" and "easy." If participants saw personal information that needed correction or ran into other points of confusion, it would often prompt them to call the VA, risking abandonment of the task. 
8. Some Veterans may find the tool unfamiliar or unexpected
    9. MAYBE FALSE: Most were familiar with the standard form layout, Your VA Dependents, and the dependents parent page. A couple of participants found it surprising that they were asked to review/confirm personal information as a part of verifying their dependents.
