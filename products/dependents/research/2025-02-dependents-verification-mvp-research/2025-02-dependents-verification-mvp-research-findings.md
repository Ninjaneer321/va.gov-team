## Research Goals
Veterans are mandated to verify their dependents' status every 8 years with VA Form 21-0538. This MVP is a partial digitization of this form for VA.gov and a call for Veterans to review and update or verify dependents annually to reduce the ~ $250 million per year of debt due to overpayments that Veterans accrue due to out-of-date dependents. This form follows the standard interview-style format on VA.gov and will be familiar to Veterans who use VA.gov to complete forms for their VA benefits. 

The purpose of this research was to 
1. Understand the Veteran’s mental model of dependent verification on VA.gov and their expectations for finding tools and completing tasks around dependent verification.
2. Validate the usability of our 0538 email notification and va.gov designs and determine whether they provide a clear path to verify and update dependents and
3. Understand how the flow, designs, and copy impact the Veteran’s understanding of the task.


## Research Questions

- How does the Veteran find dependent management info and tools on VA.gov?
- What actions and benefits do they associate with dependent management?
- How do Veterans expect to be able to accomplish tasks they associate with dependent management?

- Do directions and other informative language provide clarity or confusion?
- Do the designs allow most Veterans to verify their dependents in one sitting?
- Do we see indicators that a Veteran would take action immediately upon receiving the email?
  - Do they currently receive VA.gov notifications?
- What content or IA decisions might impede the Veteran from completing the task to verify? Update?

- Is the Veteran familiar with VA Form 0538?
- Does the Veteran’s mental model match the task they’re completing?
- Does the Veteran understand the impact of the dependency verification task?
- Do Veterans answer the yes/no question accurately and with clarity based on their dependents' situation.


## Methodology 

We conducted ten hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on February 10-14, 2025. Participants were asked a series of foundational questions regarding their experiences managing their dependents, specifically on VA.gov. They were then asked to engage with a Figma prototype representing the dependent verification experience on VA.gov: [Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/bvj72inycD0iZkuCbjYTWL/Dependent-Verification-MVP?page-id=704%3A13185&node-id=2218-77862&viewport=4550%2C30420%2C0.49&t=wyaR11IBNxWEvS5z-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2041%3A15449&show-proto-sidebar=1)

Each participant was shown the following: 

- An email notification from VA.gov that would be sent annually to direct Veterans to review and verify or update their dependents on VA.gov
- The verification experience, beginning on Your VA Dependents
  - The verification flow that ends with the Veteran submitting a VA Form 21-0538
  - The update flow that ends with the introduction page for our online tool, Request to add or remove VA dependents
- The batch request letter for VA Form 21-0538 that Veterans currently receive on an 8-year cadence

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Most Veterans will be familiar with VA.gov notifications
    1. FALSE: Most participants ignored the instructions and were unable to fill out any of the forms without a lot of help from the moderator, and many were unable to succeed even with all the help provided (especially users on mobile devices).
1. Most Veterans will engage directly with the email notification
    1. FALSE: Same reasons as above. In addition, the digital signature is not accessible to users of screen readers.
1. Veterans will have clarity around the request, but may face lack of clarity with understanding the implications of the request
    1. FALSE: Same reasons as above.
  
1. Veterans will use VA.gov’s search or benefits menu to find dependent management tools and information.
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Instructions at the top were ignored by all participants who saw them.
  
1. Most Veteran’s mental models will match the task to verify or update dependents.
    1. MAYBE TRUE: Instructions repeated were ignored by all except two participants. No one mentioned being annoyed by the repeated text.
  
2. Veterans will understand the difference between the tasks to verify and update
    3. 
4. Veterans will expect to be able to edit, add, or remove individual dependents quickly
    5.
6. Most Veterans will complete the dependency verification task with clarity and in one sitting.
7. Some Veterans may find the tool unfamiliar or unexpected
