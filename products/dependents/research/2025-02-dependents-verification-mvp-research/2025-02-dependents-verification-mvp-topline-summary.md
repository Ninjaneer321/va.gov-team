This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings


**Finding #1: Most participants (8 of 10) did not have a mental model of verification that aligned with the Mandatory Verification of Dependents (VA Form 21-0538)**

- We questioned participants about their understanding of dependent verification at multiple points throughout the session:
  - Prior to engaging the prototype, during foundational questioning
  - When reviewing the email notification
  - When engaging with the dependent verification MVP on VA.gov, either on Your VA Dependents or the first page of the form flow
- While 2 participants described dependent verification in a way that aligned with the Mandatory Verification of Dependents, the other 8 participants conflated it when providing evidence to initially make their dependency claim or other verification processes affiliated with other benefits.
- Due to this lack of clarity that dependent verification is connected to a mandatory form submission, **there is some perceived risk that the Veteran may not see a need to engage with the MVP experience beyond reviewing dependents if there is no need to make changes to their dependents.**
> _When asked "What does verification mean in this context?" when reviewing the email notification:_
> 
> “Just verifying that he's my legal husband to be on my benefits." (P2)
> 
> "Probably a birth certificate or something like that." (P3)

> _When asked "What action would you take here if you reviewed your dependents and they were correct?" when reviewing Your VA Dependents_
> 
> “If nothing has changed, [I would] close everything out." (P3)

**Recommendation #1: Provide adequate context around dependent verification's connection to the 8-year Mandatory Verification of Dependents at key touch points on VA.gov and in other VA communications.**

**Finding #2: There are opportunities to improve the findability of dependent verification specifically and dependent management in general, both in the short-term (MVP launch) and long-term.**

- Findability of the the MVP experience was a big concern for us leading up to the study, so we engaged the Content & IA Centralized Team in a findability exploration that resulted in several [recommended improvements](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1717521751866/127cbff63df95bedf011a5463797989197bc069d?sender=u859fac93c61da901b7914439) for the dependent verification MVP. 
- These concerns were validated by our findings, including that most participants expected to find tools to manage their dependents either under the main benefits menu on VA.gov (4) or a hub like MyVA (3).
  - While you can find a link that leads to the dependent verification MVP under the main benefits menu, only one participant was able to locate that link.
  - Other participants expected to find dependent management tools via the authenticated menu (2), VA.gov search (1) and the Top Links section on VA.gov home (1).

**Recommendation 2: Implement recommendations from our findability exploration that were validated by the study.**
- For MVP launch, include context around verification at key touch points and cross-link pathways.
- Later, re-examine how dependent management is positioned on VA.gov's information architecture. 

**Finding #3: Some participants (2 of 7) were caused significant confusion when reviewing the "Dependents on your VA benefits" and "Dependents not on your VA benefits" sections on Your VA Dependents.**
- Veteran's dependents are displayed in 2 sections on Your VA Dependents with the following headers and descriptions:
  - <Dependents on your VA benefits: These dependents are on your VA benefits. You can update these dependents any time.>
  - <Dependents not on your VA benefits: These dependents aren't on your VA benefits. They may not be eligible or we may need to determine their dependent status. You can update these dependents any time.> 
- These details could be key words, actions, or test outcomes
