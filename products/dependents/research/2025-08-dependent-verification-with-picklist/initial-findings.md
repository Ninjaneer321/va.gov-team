Looking at data for how the participants preferred to be asked about the death of dependents, Design 2 (where the question was an option for each dependent) was preferred by 5 of 10 participants. Two participants preferred Design 1 (where the question was asked first and on its own page), 2 had no preference, and we didn't cover this with 1 participant. Preference didn't depend on which design participants saw first.

Here are a few quotes:  

"I also like the second option [Design 2] because the questions are for each specific dependent instead of the first option where the first question was "Has any of your dependents died?" That can cause unwanted memories of having to remember people that died and what their relationship was to you even if they were not dependent on your specific disability."

"It seems kind of, kind of cold, you know? Kinda in your face, you know?"

"I think they're a little too direct . . . After your information's correct. Alright, next screen, anybody in your family died?"

"if you get that at the first. Now it's gonna go through all of your dependents to figure out who died. . . . I don't want to sit there and look at all of my dependents and say, well, nope, this one's still kicking, this one's dead, this one's still kicking. So, yeah, I find that page there [Design 1], that just seems out of character, out of place."

We also asked participants to rate each design on a scale of 1 to 5. Participants gave Design 1 an average of 3.8 points and Design 2 an average of 4.5 points. The features that participants mentioned most often that they preferred were the method of asking about dependent death in Design 2 and asking about all of the dependents on a single page in Design 2, as opposed to Design 1 where each dependent was on a separate page.
