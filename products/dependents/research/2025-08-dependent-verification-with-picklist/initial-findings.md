### Participant Demographics
- 10 Veterans
    
- 9 of them had spouses as dependents
- 7 of them had children as dependents (average of 2 child dependents for the 4 participants that shared how many children they had)

- 3 joined the study from a phone
- 7 joined the study from a laptop/desktop


### VA.gov Usage
- All participants used VA.gov
     - 2 shared that they had added dependents on VA.gov
     - Other activities that 2 or more Veterans mentioned included: managing benefits and/or claims, accessing MyHealtheVet, managing appointments, messaging providers, and requesting travel pay reimbursements

- 2 Veterans said that they use the VA app more or prefer the app


### Reviewing Dependents
- 5 participants shared if and when they look at their dependents
     - 2 said that they don't look at dependents unless they have a specific reason to
     - 2 said that they look at dependents less than VA's goal of yearly verification
     - 3 said that they go to look at their dependents when there is a specific reason (they need to make a change to their dependents, there is a change in amount of disability compensation that they receive, when a dependent is about to age out, etc)

## Prototype Feedback
### "Dependents not on your VA benefits" screen
- Alert
     - 9 of the 10 participants read aloud or commented on the alert
       
     - When it came time to act on the prompt (Imagine that you receive an email from VA that says "Review the dependents that you've added to they're VA benefits to make sure the information is accurate" the email includes a link that takes you to this page):
          - 5 used the link to move onto the next screen without direct prompting
          - 2 used the verification link farther down the page
          - 1 first tried to click on the "Add or remove a dependent" link
          - 2 had to be directly prompted to click on the link, unclear if this was a due to not being used to using a prototype or the alert or link itself



       
Looking at data for how the participants preferred to be asked about the death of dependents, Design 2 (where the question was an option for each dependent) was preferred by 5 of 10 participants. Two participants preferred Design 1 (where the question was asked first and on its own page), 2 had no preference, and we didn't cover this with 1 participant. Preference didn't depend on which design participants saw first.

Here are a few quotes:  

"I also like the second option [Design 2] because the questions are for each specific dependent instead of the first option where the first question was "Has any of your dependents died?" That can cause unwanted memories of having to remember people that died and what their relationship was to you even if they were not dependent on your specific disability."

"It seems kind of, kind of cold, you know? Kinda in your face, you know?"

"I think they're a little too direct . . . After your information's correct. Alright, next screen, anybody in your family died?"

"if you get that at the first. Now it's gonna go through all of your dependents to figure out who died. . . . I don't want to sit there and look at all of my dependents and say, well, nope, this one's still kicking, this one's dead, this one's still kicking. So, yeah, I find that page there [Design 1], that just seems out of character, out of place."

We also asked participants to rate each design on a scale of 1 to 5. Participants gave Design 1 an average of 3.8 points and Design 2 an average of 4.5 points. The features that participants mentioned most often that they preferred were the method of asking about dependent death in Design 2 and asking about all of the dependents on a single page in Design 2, as opposed to Design 1 where each dependent was on a separate page.
