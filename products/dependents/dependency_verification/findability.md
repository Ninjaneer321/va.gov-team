# Dependent verification findability

Designers: Fiorella Geedi, Ajia Wallace, Ruben Sun. 

## Background

In addition to adding the verification initiative, our team did some discovery work to understand how Veterans might find information about the "verification of dependents."  We were able to map out all the [existing extry points in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1689863079145/5b97ba9ea11077f983f3413167f6324f11aa04a8?wid=0-1733935267441). And through this process; we were able to identify several content and IA issues. 

## Problem

Through our discovery, we identified the following issues:

- Search results: 
    - Using the following phrases did not render the "about form" page for Verification of dependents:
         - Verification
         - Dependent verification
         - Verification of dependent 
    - Only using "Verification of dependents" did we see the "about form" page for Verification of dependents in the search results.
    - _HMW surface Verification information in the search results?_
    - _What phrases should surface verification information?_
- Current information page restructure and content enhancements:
    - Our paper form 686c was not mentioned on the "View or change dependents on your VA disability benefits" page.
    - The link to the online 686c/674 was hidden behind a sign-in alert
    - The content is structured differently than the other forms we've worked with.
    -  _Does it make sense to match other forms structures, such as showing the different options to apply?_
- Finding a place for Verification information
    - _Where does it make sense for this information to live?_
    - _HMW allow both authenticated and unauthenticated Veterans to find this information?_
- Improving navigation into dependents' information pages
    - Unauthenticated Veterans have to find the "View or change dependents on your VA disability benefits" page using the search functionality
    - Only authenticated Veterans can find their dependents in the profile menu
    - _HMW make the Dependents information discoverable on VA.gov?_
    - _HMW make the Dependents Verification information discoverable on VA.gov?_
