## Problem Statement

Veterans currently struggle to understand their responsibilities for managing dependents on their VA benefits. Existing content on VA.gov lacks clarity around critical dependent management requirements, leading to:

*  Confusion about the process to add dependents along with initial application to disability benefit program 
* Confusion about what changes need to be reported to the VA relative to dependents
* Not submitting dependent verification for disability benefits (in particular, not understanding that verificiation is a requirement separate from/in addition to reporting ongoing changes)
*   Unclear timelines for reporting dependent status changes
*   Limited understanding of consequences for non-compliance
*   Potential benefit overpayments and processing delays for Veterans
     
  
## Project Goals
*   Improve Veteran understanding of dependent management responsibilities through clear, actionable content
*   Reduce administrative burden on both Veterans and VA staff by providing comprehensive self-service information
*   Decrease processing errors caused by unreported or incorrectly reported dependent changes
*   Enhance compliance with VA dependent reporting requirements
    

## Target Audience

* Primary: Veterans currently receiving benefits with dependents or considering adding dependents
* Secondary: Veteran family members who may assist with benefit management
* Tertiary: Veteran service representatives and VA staff who support Veterans

## Desired Outcomes
  
Veterans can easily locate and access comprehensive, clear information about their dependent management responsibilities on publicly accessible content pages throughout VA.gov. Veterans understand why they need to verify their dependents' status, report changes to their dependents' status to the VA, what specific changes require reporting, when these changes must be reported, and the potential consequences of failing to report changes timely. This improved content helps Veterans fulfill their dependent management obligations proactively, reducing benefit payment errors, overpayments, and administrative burdens for both Veterans and the VA.

## Key Stakeholders

*   Content and IA team
    
*   Dependents management team
    
*   VBA Subject Matter Experts: Provide regulatory guidance and accuracy review
    
*   Legal/Compliance reviewers


## Lean roadmap

### Fall 2025
- Improve content hierarchy: Implement progressive disclosure strategy for dependents management unauthenticated resource pages to improve content hierarchy. Update existing pages and add new pages specific to dependent type and benefit program type. 
- Audit and improve authenticated dependent management entry points and cross-links (within experiences owned by the lifestage benefits team e.g., Add/remove dependent form intro/confirmation pages, Your VA dependents page)

### Next
**Clearly communicate information about impact and consequences:** Add information about importance of dependent management, how it impacts benefits, and the consequences of neglecting to manage dependents. Possibly in the form of a new resource page about payments/overpayments.

### Later
Consider implementing a holistic content strategy for change reporting and overpayment prevention. Build the strategy informed by Veterans mental model and moments in their benefit journey experience where they may be most likely to notice and take action on dependents management requirements.
