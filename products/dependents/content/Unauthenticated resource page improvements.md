# Unauthenticated resource page improvements for dependents management

This effort identifies gaps and opportunities within publicly accessible pages on VA.gov for information related to managing dependents on VA benefits. The audit will assess content accuracy, completeness, findability, and user experience for veterans, family members, and veteran service organizations seeking to navigate dependent management processes.

Scope
-----

This audit covers dependent management content across the following VA benefit programs, including:

-   Disability compensation

-   Pension benefits

-   Survivors benefits

Definition of Dependent Management
----------------------------------

For the purposes of this audit, dependent management encompasses three primary actions:

-   Adding dependents to VA benefits (during initial claims, after benefit decisions, or due to life changes)

-   Removing dependents from existing benefits

-   Updating dependent information for current beneficiaries

Information Needs Assessment
----------------------------

To effectively manage dependents on VA benefits, claimants and beneficiaries require comprehensive information about:

**Eligibility and requirements**

-   Dependent eligibility criteria for each benefit type

-   Required documentation and evidence

-   Special considerations for different dependent categories (spouse, children, disabled adult children, etc.)

**Process and timing**

-   Instructions for management acttivities

-   Processing timelines and what to expect

-   Digital vs. paper submission options and their implications

-   When and how to follow up on submitted requests

**Financial impact**
-   How dependent changes affect payment amounts

-   Effective dates for benefit adjustments

-   Potential overpayments or underpayments and resolution processes

**Support and resolution**

-   Appeal processes for denied dependent claims

-   Contact information for help

-   Common issues and troubleshooting guidance

-   Resources for special circumstances


Success Metrics
---------------

The audit will identify opportunities to improve user experience by ensuring veterans and their families can successfully locate, understand, and act on dependent management information without requiring authenticated access or direct VA contact.

Summary of recommendations
----------------------
  
### Manage dependents resource page 
Link to page: [Review or change dependents for disability, pension, or DIC benefits](https://www.va.gov/view-change-dependents))

#### Issue: Information overload and poor content hierarchy

The current page includes a dense mix of basic information and program-specific details about dependent types, creating cognitive burden and making it difficult for users to find relevant information quickly.

Recommendation: Implement a progressive disclosure strategy

-   Lead with fundamental information relevant to all users (what dependents are, why management matters, when to take action)

-   Move detailed program-specific and dependent-type information to dedicated resource pages

-   Use clear cross-linking to guide users to relevant detailed information

#### Issue: Missing context about importance and consequences

The page focuses heavily on procedural "what" and "how" information but fails to explain the "why" - specifically, what life changes trigger the need for dependent updates and what happens if changes aren't reported.

Recommendation: Add motivational and contextual content

-   Open the page with clear messaging about the importance of maintaining accurate dependent information to ensure correct benefit payments and avoid overpayment debt

-   Include common life change scenarios that require dependent updates (marriage, divorce, birth, death, changes in school enrollment, etc.)

-   Explain consequences of delayed or missing updates, including the risk of overpayments and VA debt

### Benefit Program Resource Pages
Links: 
- [Disability ](https://www.va.gov/disability/)
- [Pension](https://www.va.gov/pension/)
- [DIC](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/)

#### Issue: Hidden dependent management guidance

Within disability, pension, and DIC program pages, information about adding dependents is either missing or buried within general benefit management content. New disability claimants may not realize that adding dependents requires separate action after initial benefit approval.

Recommendation: Integrate dependent information into benefit program flows

-   Add dependent eligibility and processes to the disability and pension"eligibility" section and "how to apply" sections (DIC page structure is different and doesn't include a separate eligibility page)

-   Consider how best to incorporate program-specific guidance (e.g., disability benefits require 30% rating before dependents can be added) (e.g., in a separate "Adding dependents to your [benefit type]," incorporated in an existing page, etc.)

-   Disability: Include dependent-related next steps on "After you file your claim" pages

-   Disability: Move disability-specific dependent FAQs to disability hub (either as part of another page or its own page)

### Broader content strategy opportunities


#### Issue: Fragmented change reporting guidance

VA.gov lacks comprehensive information about reporting life changes that affect benefits. Dependent updates represent just one category of required reporting, but information is scattered across multiple pages without clear connection to the broader concept of change reporting responsibilities.

Recommendation: Develop unified change reporting content strategy

-   Create a master "Reporting changes to VA" resource page that covers all types of changes (dependents, income, address, employment, etc.)

-   Position dependent management as one component of broader change reporting responsibilities

-   Cross-reference international best practices (Australian Department of Veteran Affairs, gov.uk) for comprehensive change reporting guidance

-   Ensure consistent messaging about timing, methods, and consequences across all change types

#### Issue: Insufficient overpayment prevention and management content

While VA.gov includes debt management information, it lacks proactive content about overpayment prevention, early recognition, and initial response steps.

Recommendation: Expand overpayment-related content

-   Create dedicated overpayment resource page covering prevention, identification, and initial response

-   Include information about voluntary reporting of suspected overpayments

-   Connect overpayment prevention directly to change reporting responsibilities

-   Provide clear pathways from overpayment content to debt resolution resources

### Implementation priority recommendation

**Next:**

-   Restructure manage dependents page with progressive disclosure
-   Add dependent guidance to benefit program pages

**Later:**

-   Change reporting content strategy
-   Create overpayment prevention resources
