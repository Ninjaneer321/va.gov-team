# Steps

- Review the recent list of notifications for an error in the #benefits-dependents-management-notifications Slack channel
- If you're looking into an error, acknowledge the notification with the :eyes: emoji and detail any triage findings in a thread for the notification in question. 
- If additional investigation or remediation is required, open an issue in the [Benefits Dependents Experience Project Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1237/views/3). For issues that are causing outages, or severely impacting the overall functionally of the 21-686c and 21-674 forms, review the [Incident Response](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/README.md#incident-response) section of the Product Outline for further guidance.
- Check the #vfs-all-teams , #vfs-platform-support or other platform Slack channels to confirm if any anomalies are due to platform changes or other system wide issues.
- Check whether a recent Benefits Dependents Experience update is causing the error.
