# 686c/674 Transition Hub

**Updated TBD**

> The purpose of this transition document is to outline the current state of 21-686c and 21-674 forms product development. It serves as a "front door" to documentation and resources collected during the course of product design and development from March 2023 through March 2025. Included are links to more specific transition hubs where you can find direct links to resources and references used during design and development. These Transition Docs are "point in time" documents, and may not reflect current progress, deployments or upcoming efforts.
