# Dole Act Section 210 - Product Outline

---

## Overview
Recent legislation, specifically in referencing the Elizabeth Dole Act - Section 210, mandates that Veterans should have electronic means to access letters and documents related to their GI Bill education benefits. Electronic letter functionality will be incorporated into key touchpoints within the education hub and VA profile of VA.gov, allowing Veterans to opt in/out of electronic letter commmunications and access neccessary education documents.  

## Problem Statement
How might we allow GI Bill beneficiaries streamlined and easy access to important information regarding their education benefits
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- GI Bill beneficiaries will be able to easily and quickly access letters (dated after 2022) related to their education benefits via their signed-in account on VA.gov
- GI Bill beneficiaries will be able to seamlessly set their preference for education letter communication (mail or electronic) within their VA.gov account
- Previously, GI Bill beneficiaries needed to request other letters related to their education benefits through Ask VA


## Desired Business Outcomes

Allowing GI Bill beneficiaries access letters and documents relating to their education benefits will:
- Improve and quicken communications between the VA and GI Bill beneficiaries
- Reduce Ask VA requests
- Reduce costs related to printing and mailing of letters
- Provide a consolidated secure location for important documentation relating to a GI Bill beneficiaries education benefits, ultimately streamlining and improving the Veteran's experience

## Assumptions
- Educated assumption of all relevant areas users may want to access their education letters and opt in/out of communications

## Solution Approach

We have interpreted the legislative change and identified all relevant touch points within VA.gov's education hub and within the VA profile. We have narrowed the touch points to:
- Online education applications - Opt in/out of eletronic letter delivery
- VA profile notification settings - Opt in/out of eletronic letter delivery
- [Download you VA education letter](https://www.va.gov/education/download-letters/) - Search for and download letters and documents related to their education benefits

We have considered the availability of letters (noting that letters delivered before 2022 cannot be retrieved as they are not part of My Education Benefits), constraints of backend calls to our letters service and considerations for retrieving letters via SSN or claimant ID, ensuring the user experience and designs considers the backend implementation while providing a intuitive search functionality for users.

### Supporting research

- Electronic letter functionality iterates on features and pages that already exist on VA.gov. New functionality is expected to have minimal updates to the online education applications, VA profile notification settings, and [Download you VA education letter](https://www.va.gov/education/download-letters/) page. Updates will follow existing VA design system guidelines, leverage office hours, and are not expected to radically change the existing user experience.
