# Research plan for usability testing of<br> a GI Bill forms recommender tool 
**My Education Benefits--DGIB Team  | December 2024**

`Joanna Yu, researcher | Slack: @Joanna Yu | GH: joannayudgib`

## Background
We are replacing the outdated, deprecated How to Apply "wizard" that is located on the EDU How to apply and Eligibility sections of VA.gov. Our "EDU Application Recommender Tool" is a 1:1 replacement of the wizard and will programmatically review prospective applicant information on the backend to recommend a likely education application form.

- What problem is your product trying to solve? **Beneficiaries often submit the incorrect form when applying for GI Bill benefits. We want to increase the likelihood that they submit the correct form to reduce the need for resubmissions.** <!-- **Finding a suitable replacement to the current process for locating the correct education benefit form for a Veteran** -->
- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? **Our new tool will replace the "wizard" in the Education and Training hub on the How to Apply page.** <!-- **Authenticated experience will give us the background we need to accurately guide Veterans and their family members to the right form** -->
- What is Veteransâ€™ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one? **The Recommender Tool is a new feature on a familiar page. It will replace the "wizard" currently on the How to Apply page.**<!-- **This is a 1:1 replacement with a existing wizard, Veteran familiarty is TBD but prior research has suggested it as confusing, convoluted, and malfunctioning.** -->

### OCTO Priorities 

Supports: Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
Supports: Reinventing myself: Acquiring the appropriate education, credentials and skills. 

## Research Goals	
1. Determine what will best help GI Bill beneficiaries into the correct form
2. Determine if beneficiaries understand and trust our recommendations 
3. Determine if 'off-ramps' to different benefit options are sufficient for users seeking other educational benefits

### Outcome
User research will help us determine what improvements are needed to the user flow, copy, and information hierarchy to optimize a user's understanding and trust in the tool.<!-- **Research will inform us how well the user flow, copy, and information hierarchy are working for the user. We will use findings to directly improve the tool before deployment. ** -->

### Research questions
1. Do users understand the path forward presented in our 'recommendations'?
2. Do users feel our 'recommendations' are correct based on their circumstances?
3. Do our 'recommendations' deliver the right information so users can proceed with confidence?
4. What else would users consider doing? Do we support those paths?

### Hypothesis
Recent review has uncovered the How to Apply wizard on the Education hub is outdated, faulty, and confusing. We hypothesize that a more straigh-solution that 'automatically' present recommendations will be well-received and trusted. We expect that some laguage presented may be confusing but will generally communicate the options available to users. We expect most users will be able to find avenues to other (No GI Bill) education benefits on the page.

## Methodology	

- Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research

With sufficient time before deployement to add to our product backlog and improve it before production, we will use usabiltiy testing to generate new ideas on how to improve the recommender tool, but also to validate what is/is not working for the end-user. 

### Location

Remote interviews via Zoom (set up by Perigean)

### Research materials

* [Recommender Tool Prototype](https://accenturefederal.invisionapp.com/console/share/U2DNZPWFB4K), Password: DGIB2024
* [Recommender Tool Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/cb013390098d5f3fa87b92a4c897f03f2bc2bb7f/products/my-education-benefits/research/2024-12-recommender-tool/conversation-guide.md)
	
## Recruitment

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

### Recruitment approach

Our intended audience will be a blend of Veterans and Veterans' family members and/or dependents. 

### Recruitment criteria
Perigean recruitment, with a goal of 9 total sessions, focusing on primary criteria:

- 3 to 5 Veterans
- 3 to 5 Dependents of Veterans (spouse or child to Veteran) that has used transferred self-entitled benefits before from their Veteran sponsor
- 3 to 5 Dependents of Veterans (spouse of child to Veteran) that is the child or spouse of a Veteran or service member who has passed away, is captured or missing, or is permanently and totally disabled due to a service-connected disability

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- Category A: 3 Veterans
- Category B: 3 Dependents of Veterans (spouse or child to Veteran) that has used transferred self-entitled benefits before from their Veteran sponsor
- Category C: 3 Dependents of Veterans (spouse of child to Veteran) that is the child or spouse of a Veteran or service member who has died, is captured or missing, or is permanently and totally disabled due to a service-connected disability

_We would ask that Perigean recruits a diverse demographic breakdown. _

**SCREENER**
1. Are you a self-entitled Veteran that has served in our US military? IF YES, put into category A. IF NO, continnue to question 2.
2. Has your Veteran parent or spouse transferred you benefits before for your own benefit entitlement? This may have been done using the DEERS system through DoD. IF YES, put into category B. IF NO, continue to question 3.
3. Has your Veteran parent or spouse passed away, is captured or missing, or is permanently and totally disabled due to a service-connected disability? IF YES, put into category C. IF NO, please do not include in the study. 


## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

* Research materials submitted for review: Week of 12/02/2024
* Planned Test Sessions: 12/11/24 - 12/20/24

### Prepare

Our prototypes are ready for testing. Because we are still in a generative phase, we have only completed the design intent. 

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: alexander.ferzola@afs.com
* Date and time of pilot session:  TBD

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: 11/18 through 12/13

### Length of sessions

Sessions will likely last 20-30 mins. We would prefer no more than 2 tests per day - they should have at least 30 mins between buffer time.

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**

Any time from 11am EST through 4pm EST can be made available for testing sessions.
