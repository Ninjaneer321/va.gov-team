# Conversation Guide 

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Mute your Slack notifications*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.*

*In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to be talking about the How to Apply tool.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 20 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5-7 minutes

Before we look at the demo tool, I would like to know more about you. Can we start with a few warm-up questions?

*Use these questions to ensure participant background was correctly filtered, if not pivot to a different flow as needed.*

If Veteran:
- Tell us about your service experience or service history?
- Have you applied for education benefits before? If so, by what method (paper, online, etc.)?
- If you wanted to apply for education benefits, could you explain to me how would you start that? 

If Dependent:
- So we know you are a dependent of [relationship], could you tell me a little bit more about that?
- Have you applied for education benefits before? If so, by what method (paper, online, etc.)?

*Share prototype link to appropriate flow, participant shares screen, and then contextualize the test scenario for the them*

Thanks for sharing your experience with us. I am going to contextualize what you are currently looking at based on what you've told me. You are currently on the "How to Apply" online page on VA.gov. This page includes resources about GI Bill benefits but more importantly for todays session, it gets users like yourself to the online application to apply for education benefits. Based on your experience, 

**Form 22-1990**
Retierate experience to them, use the factors below as needed:
- Intent to go back to school.
- Has not used education benefits in the past nor are currently using them.

**Form 22-1990e**
Retierate experience to them, use the factors below as needed:
- You are the spouse (or child) of a Veteran.
- You have not served in the military before.
- You have not used education benefits before nor are currently using them.
- Your spouse (or parent) has formally transferred benefits to you.

**Form 22-5490**
Retierate experience to them, use the factors below as needed:
- You are the spouse (or child) of a Veteran.
- You have not served in the military before.
- You have not used education benefits before nor are currently using them.
- Your spouse (or parent) has not formally transferred benefits to you.

Before we jump into to the task, do you have any questions about the information given?

## Wayfinding - 3 minutes

"If you wanted to apply for education benefits, could you explain to me how would you start that?"
"Now looking at the VA home page, how would do that here?"

## Task 1: Find the appropriate form - 3-5 minutes

"In light of the information, where would you look first to find the application form thats right for you?"

Probing questions (if the user gets stuck):
- Where might you look first to begin the process? Why?
- Where would you look to sign in? 
- Our prototype does not have typing capabilities, lets try clicking the username field to input the login information.
- What would you do to finish logging in?
- Looking at this [the recommendation], does it feel like you're in the right place?
- What is your confidence level looking at this information? How are you understanding the other information on this page?

### Things to watch for:
Un-Authenticated State, clicking log-in:
- How easily does the user understand the information presented?
- How easily does the user locate the recommender tool?

Logging in using ID.me (ONLY 1990 and 1990e):
- How easily does the user understand the un-authenticated vs. authenticated state? 
- Does the user notice and understand the authenticator widget?
- Are there pain points or confusion for the user when logging in?
- Is the participant aware that they may be sharing personal information on their screen, and are they okay with that? - per question as needed

Legacy system conditional questions (ONLY 5490):
- What are the points of confusion for the participant as they answer the questions?
- Are they able to answer the questions easily?

Receiving recommended benefit:
- How easily does the user locate the recommended benefit?
- How easily does the user understand the recommended benefit?

## Task 2: Locate secondary recommendation - 1-2 minutes 
*Not applicable for 22-5490 flow*

"Lets say this is not the benefit you want to apply for, where would you look next?"
"How are you understanding the alternate recommendation? Is there anything in particular thats confusing?"
"Now lets say you didnâ€™t like that, what else on this page would you expect to be an option"

### Things to watch for:

- Is the user able to locate the secondary recommendation? If so, how easily?
- Does the user understand secondary recommendation?
- Does user seem confused or fatigued when interpreting information presented? If so, what specifcally (copy, scrolling, etc?)

**Repeat Tasks 1 & 2 for other two flows**
   

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How was your experience in receiving the recommended application in each of the three flows? What factors made it easy or what factors made it hard?
- How was your experience in locating the secondary recommendation in two of the flows? What factors made it easy or what factors made it hard?
- Which of the three flows was the easiest for you? What factors made that flow particularly easy or easier than the other two?
- Was there anything in particular that was hard to find? What made it hard to find?
- Was there anything in particular that that you found confusing? What made it confusing?
- Are there any factors that differentiated the three flows from each other? Were those factors helpful or did they make the process more confusing (try to get specifcs)?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
