## Intro (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to be talking about the Dual Benefit Eligbility tool.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (5 minutes)

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

1. What factors have made applying and/or learning about GI Bill benefits successful? What factors have made it difficult?
2. What resources do you use when trying to apply, change, or learn more about GI Bill benefits?
3. What is your confidence level in navigating your education benefits? What factors contribute to your confidence level?

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Task 1: Locate the self-review tool (3 minutes)

**INTERNAL NOTE: Might recommend to remove this first task. Idea would be dedicating more time to the tool itself will help us gather more insight into the "meat" of what were researching. trade off is the user might have a harder time orienting/contextualizing themselves affecting their understanding and ability to navigate the tool. if we remove, have to be considerate of how we set up this test scenario.**

**"You are currently on the VA education and training landing page on VA.gov. Looking at this screen, where would you look first to make updates or changes to your education benefits"**

Probing questions:
- What markers drew your attention there?

Qualitative questions:
