# VA.gov Homepage Ownership and Governance

Guidance around the use of the VA.gov homepage is published as the [Homepage template in the VA Design System]() [COMING SOON!]

Each section of the homepage is tightly controlled and governed to ensure we are delivering the clearest and most accessible experience possible for all Veterans, service members, their family members and their caregivers.

### Sections owned by OPIA

OPIA controls what content/information is displayed within these 2 sections of the homepage:
- The main promo space at the top of the homepage content
- The featured news section

Any requests to change the content in these sections must be approved by OPIA, and OCTO content is responsible for implementing any changes.

### Sections owned by OCTO

OCTO controls what content/information is displayed within these sections of the homepage:
- Create account section on the upper right corner of the page
- The search tools section
- The top pages section
- The grid of benefit hubs
- The feedback survey implementation
- The email sign up implementation

Any requests to change the content in these sections must be requested and approved by OCTO, and OCTO content or IA is responsible for implementing any changes.

## Governance of the "Top pages" section

To be considered for placement within this section, the feature must meet set criteria and rank well based on a rubric of metrics.  

**Evaluation process**
- New candidates for placement can be evaluated against the criteria and rubric at any time. However, newly launched features should not be considered a candidate until they have been live to 100% of site visitors for at least 3 months.
- Performance of the currently placed features are reviewed quarterly to evaluate how the feature is performing in its placement as well as measuring any impact on removed features. 

**Placement consideration requirements**
Features must meet the following criteria to be considered for placement:
- The feature must be for Veterans.  It can serve other audiences, but it must serve Veterans.
- The feature must be an interactive tool that allows users to complete tasks related to viewing, tracking, managing, or using benefits they have already applied for.  It cannot be a generic static content page or a benefit application.

**Display guidance**
- Minimum of 8, maximum of 10 options allowed, equally distributed across 2 columns
- Items in order based on their rubric score - which accounts for views, utilization, and relevancy - from top left to bottom right
- Features cannot overlap with another tool in the section 
- Features cannot duplicate an option within the "Search tools" section

**Metrics evaluated in rubric**
- Primary metric:  Demand
  - How much visitors utilize the feature, measured by total page views. Features that have high page views are, in theory, used by a large number of visitors and/or have a higher frequency of use.
- Secondary metric: Reach
  - How broadly does the feature apply across our audience, measured by the number of core benefit types the tool supports. Features that support multiple types of benefits have the opportunity to benefit more visitors. 
- Secondary metric: Exposure
  - How prominant the feature currently is, measured by the number of places the feature is currently linked to from global/sitewide placements (home page, header, footer, and primary nav). Features with placement in those components already have a level of visibility and ease of access. 

Decision rationale:
- Why only features intended to manage benefits already applied for? These features are often accessed multiple times within a benefit journey, and often the reason for return visits. In addition, these features are generally the more challenging pages to find.  The primary navigation menu and the benefit hub section of the homepage provide prominent navigation links to get visitors to general benefit information and forms to apply.  This section will provide quick access to tools that allow visitors to complete common tasks.
- Why wait 3 months before a new tool can be evaluated for placement? A new tool can be evaluated for placement after it has been live for at least 3 months at 100%.  This allows the tool to settle in its home, work out any initial launch issues, and gather early data and feedback. Newer tools may not have the level traffic needed to rank within the rubric for placement.  This section is not inteneded to promote the newest feature, it is intended to provide quick access to the most important/highly used features. For features that have findability issues, the root of that findability issue should be resolved first.
- Why wasn't conversion rate/CTR of main CTA within a feature used in the rubric?  Not all tools are transaction based, some are simply a means to view information or see a status. In order to evaluate tools equally, we chose to look at page views as an indicator on how frequently a feature was accessed versus how frequently a specific task was completed given some features do not have actions to take.
