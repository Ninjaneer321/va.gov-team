[Raw Medallia data](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/SitewidePublicWebsites/Shared%20Documents/UX%20Research/Medallia%20survey%20data/Homepage_Medallia_Jan-June2024.xlsx?d=w9fa3cb6e315c4d6290170a4449113ded&csf=1&web=1&e=EMjvu7) in Excel Sharepoint.

Analysis of user verbatims from Medallia A11 intercept and VFS feedback surveys. Synthesis completed for last 30 days, JUNE 1-30, 2024 that included 743 responses, not all had +/- feedback. (raw data: Jan 01, 2024 - June 30, 2024). 

### Quantitative breakdown
| Metric | Rating
|---|:---:

| Average VA.gov Understanding Rating:  | 63.25%
| Average General VA Trust Rating:  | 41.95%
| Average Trust in the VA's Commitment to Veterans: |  70.16%
| Percentage of users able to complete their task: |  18.1%
| Average overall satisfaction with the site:  | 13.28%

### Findings
1. The largest pain point was Sign In: 88 of 743 responses.
   - 15 - creating / verifying account or ID
   - 15 - signs out w/out user action
   - 28 - found too difficult or hard
   - 13 - MHV, causing multiple sign ins
   - 13 - Misc negative sentiment about sign in
   - 4  - attempting travel pay link, unable to sign in
2. The largest positive sentiment was the IA / site was easy to navigate.  49 of 743 responses. 
3. Additional various insights were not statistically relevant themes.

### Recommendations
1. We know **sign in** actively being improved by our Login / Identity crew and MHV on VA.gov is actively working to improve these known related issues. Hypothesis is that next Medallia pull/review should show an improvement in this area. No additional opportunities for improvement were identified.
