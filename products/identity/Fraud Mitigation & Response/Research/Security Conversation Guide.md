# Platform Security & CSOC Fraud Intersection Discussion Guide

**Meeting Duration:** 30 minutes  
**Participants:** Identity Team, Platform Security/CSOC Representatives  
**Objective:** Surface shared signals, clarify boundaries, and identify coordination opportunities between security operations and identity-layer fraud mitigation

## Opening & Context Setting (5 minutes)

### Introduction
"Thank you for joining us today. My name is [name], and I work on the Identity team at the VA. I really appreciate you taking the time to chat about security protocols at the VA.

Our goal is to avoid duplication and find collaboration opportunities."

### Key Context to Share
- Our need to understand the broader security context
- Interest in shared tooling or data sources
