# **Research Plan for Identity Experience, Caregivers (preliminary conversations)**

## **Background**

Caregivers are given permission by Veterans to manage the care or personal affairs of Veterans.  In order to understand the digital needs, we are having preliminary conversations with caregivers who we have identified through our immediate team (since they are difficult to get ahold of).

### **OCTO Identity Crew Objectives**

* Objective 1: Create a smooth transition for Veterans from legacy to modern sign-in credentials  
* Objective 2: Improve the Veteran sign-in experience.

### **Veteran Journey**

Securely accessing VA online services on behalf of a Veteran that isn’t oneself can happen at any stage in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). But may be most likely to initiate in “starting up,” “taking care of myself,” and “aging.” The updated Sign-in page and modal will apply to everyone who signs into VA online and uses the authenticated experience.

## **Research Goals**

* Discover how caregivers are able to access Veteran services behalf of Veterans
* Explore how caregivers interact with VA.gov or other digital services  
* Better understand and empathhize with the caregiver journey and uncover any potential pain points as they navigate the VA

### **Outcome**  
Learn about the process of how caregivers are able to complete various tasks and functions on behalf of Veterans. The focus is anything from the point of being designated by the Veteran all the way through completion of any actions behalf of a Veteran.

### **Research questions**

- How is a guardian currently authorized and designated as a caregiver?    
- What forms and processes must a caregiver and Veteran follow in order to start the process?
- How might a Veteran assign permissions for a caregiver?  For what period of time is the designation active? 
- Is there an offboarding process as well?  
- What in-person interactions were necessary to complete the process?
- Through what mechanisms does the caregiver undergo to complete actions on behalf of the Veteran?
  - Is the caregiver given digital access?

### **Hypotheses**

- H1: A Veteran must file form(s) with the VA in order to designate a caregive to act on their behalf.
- H2: Veterans can designate specific permissions that caregivers may have.  
- H3: There is a standardized practice at the VA for granting caregiver access at the VA.
- H4: State guidelines do not affect caregiver access.  
- H5: Caregivers do not currently have access to digitally complete actions on behalf of the Veteran they are caring for.
  
## **Methodology**

Interview caregivers who have completed various actions on behalf of Veterans.

### **Research materials**

- Conversation guide  

## **Recruitment**
We will be speaking to known caregivers since they have been historically hard to get in touch with.
