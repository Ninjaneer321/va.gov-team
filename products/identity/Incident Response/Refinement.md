On Thursday, May 16, 2024, the Identity Team held a refinement for Incident Repsonse. Here's what we came up with.

## Problem Statement
We currently do not have an end-to-end methodology for defining, tracking, communicating and resolving incidents. In order to better serve Veterans and other VA.gov, we need to implement and communicate a formalized Incident Response process which includes the following:
- Incident Management System
- Outage Communication
- System Recovery Process
- Internal Reporting on Incidents

## Considerations
- ATO Requirement: steps to recover service.
- All the the datadog alerts have links to old response docs, need to be updated.
- Document where our lines of resposibilites begin and end.
