## Overview

VA recently retired its use of the My HealtheVet user ID and password (March 2025), and plans to retire its use of DS Logon after 9/30/2025. As such, VA is requiring all people to create an ID.me or Login.gov account if they want to manage their VA health care and benefits online.

Both ID.me and Login.gov require that a person verify as themselves, and verifying on behalf of someone else is not allowed. As such, ID.me and Login.gov will not allow delegates to verify a credential for another person (ie. the veteran whom they care for), which means that delegates can not transition to ID.me or Login.gov as we are asking other users to do.

### My HealtheVet delegate solution

In 2021, the My HealtheVet team worked with the IAM team to launch a delegate solution for the My HealtheVet website. IAM built a tool that supported delegate designation. This tool sent a consent form to a Veteran to designate a delegate, and then tied that Veteran's information to that of their delegate. The tool could also revoke delegate access. When people who'd been granted delegate access signed into My HealtheVet, they would see an option to view My HealtheVet as themselves or as the Veteran for whom they were a delegate.

Despite being fully built out, My HealtheVet never fully utilized delegate access outside of a small group of internal staff. This functionality was never launched to the broader Veteran/caregiver population.

### Current need

The OCTO Login & Identity team has been tasked with validating a user need around online delegate access. If that need is validated, our team needs to determine the MVP use case and user needs for delegate access, determine the unique security concerns and constraints for providing delegate access on VA.gov, and build the infrastructure and end-user experience that will support delegate access on VA.gov.

## User Problem Statement

- As a delegate, I need to manage a(nother) Veteran's business with VA on their behalf.
- As a person who interacts with VA, I need an ID.me or Login.gov account to manage my VA business online.

## Business goals

- Determine need for delegate access to VA.gov.
- Support delegates and caregivers in conducting business with VA on behalf of another person, whether they would like to conduct that business online, over the phone, or in person.
- Abide by all privacy and security laws and protocols required to protect people's information.

## Questions and Hypotheses

### Questions

- There are many kinds of delegates at VA. Where should we focus our MVP?
- How do caregivers manage their Veterans' business at VA (Eg. online, over the phone, in-person, etc)? What do caregivers actually do on behalf of Veterans?
- What consent forms are needed to designate someone online delegate access?
- How can we revoke access?
- Is there a legally above-board way to grant delegate access to court-appointed guardians since the Veteran can not provide explicit consent? Does this population need online access?
- How do court-appointed guardians manage their Veterans' care now? What do they manage (eg. just health care; other benefits)?
- What are the consequences if we do not build delegate access?
- Can we leverage the existing IAM delegate tool? If not, what do we need to build?
- Where should the delegate designation and delegate <> Veteran relationship be stored?
- Where should delegate consent forms be stored?

### Hypotheses

- The primary delegate access use case will be for caregivers. This population only needs to manage health care-related tasks on behalf of the Veteran they care for.
- Caregivers do not actually need to see a(nother) Veteran's entire VA.gov account.
