## Overview

VA recently retired its use of the My HealtheVet user ID and password (March 2025), and VA plans to retire its use of DS Logon after 9/30/2025. As such, VA is requiring all people who want to manage health care and benefits online to create an ID.me or Login.gov account.

Both ID.me and Login.gov require that a person verify as themselves, and verifying on behalf of someone else is not allowed. As such, ID.me and Login.gov will not allow delegates to verify a credential for another person (ie. the veteran whom they care for), which means that delegates can not transition to ID.me or Login.gov as we are asking other users to do.

As a result, the OCTO Login & Identity team has been tasked with validating a user need around online delegate access, and if that need is validating, building and launching an MVP of online delegate access.
