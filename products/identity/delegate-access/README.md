## Overview

VA recently retired its use of the My HealtheVet user ID and password (March 2025), and plans to retire its use of DS Logon after 9/30/2025. As such, VA is requiring all people to create an ID.me or Login.gov account if they want to manage their VA health care and benefits online.

Both ID.me and Login.gov require that a person verify as themselves, and verifying on behalf of someone else is not allowed. As such, ID.me and Login.gov will not allow delegates to verify a credential for another person (ie. the veteran whom they care for), which means that delegates can not transition to ID.me or Login.gov as we are asking other users to do.

### My HealtheVet delegate solution

In 2021, the My HealtheVet team worked with the IAM team to launch a delegate solution for the My HealtheVet website. IAM built a tool that supported delegate designation. This tool sent a consent form to a Veteran to designate a delegate, and then tied that Veteran's information to that of their delegate. The tool could also revoke delegate access. When people who'd been granted delegate access signed into My HealtheVet, they would see an option to view My HealtheVet as themselves or as the Veteran for whom they were a delegate.

Despite being fully built out, My HealtheVet never fully utilized delegate access outside of a small group of internal staff. This functionality was never launched to the broader Veteran/caregiver population.

### Current need

The OCTO Login & Identity team has been tasked with validating a user need around online delegate access. If that need is validated, our team needs to determine the MVP use case and user needs for delegate access, determine the unique security concerns and constraints for providing delegate access on VA.gov (vs. My HealtheVet, which only housed health care information), and build the infrastructure and end-user experience that will support delegate access on VA.gov.
