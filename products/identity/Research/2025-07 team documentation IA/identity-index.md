# Identity index

## Overview

The index is a structured list of all the components the Identity team has previously shipped and currently maintains. This includes Identity team-owned applications, services, and integrations.

Each individual component includes:
- **Documentation:** The best resource for someone to learn about the service, integration, or application.
- **Subject matter expert:** The best person to consult to make sure page content is accurate.
