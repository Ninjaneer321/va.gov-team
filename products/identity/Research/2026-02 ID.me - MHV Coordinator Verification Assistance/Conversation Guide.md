# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[MODERATOR NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
**[If there are observers]** I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about your experience supporting Veterans with **ID.me sign-in and identity verification**, especially where Veterans get stuck and what could reduce friction for both Veterans and coordinators.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your job in any way. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

- I know the folks who invited you to participate asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
  - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
  - **If yes:** Admit observers.

> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction (first name + role).
> - Once complete, ask observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

  <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand staff experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across VA is by showing short video clips of sessions. In these clips, we remove or blur any identifying information. These clips will not be shared outside of VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.

  - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand staff experiences?**

  <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, enable transcription/captions if available.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

<mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we get into ID.me support scenarios, I’d like to start with a few background questions.

1. Could you describe your role in your own words?
   - What does a typical day/week look like?

2. About how long have you been in this role?

3. What channels do Veterans typically use to reach you (phone, in-person, secure message, etc.)?
   - Does ID.me support differ depending on the channel?

4. Roughly, what proportion of your support work involves ID.me verification or sign-in issues?

---

## First Task: Quantify + segment ID.me verification support demand - 10 minutes

1. **How often are you supporting Veterans who are verifying with ID.me?**
   - Daily / weekly / monthly?
   - Are there patterns (seasonal, tied to appointments, medication refills, enrollment, etc.)?

2. **How often are you encountering situations where Veterans are unable to verify with ID.me (daily/weekly/other frequency)?**
   - Roughly what percent of those cases are resolved the same day vs require follow-up?

3. **How many Veterans already have an existing ID.me account vs verifying for the first time?**
   - *(Follow-up for clarity)* When a Veteran “already has an account,” is the blocker usually:
     - (a) account exists but not identity-verified
     - (b) identity-verified but cannot access/sign in
     - (c) account recovery (email/phone/device) problems
     - (d) something else?

4. What are the top 3 most common ID.me-related issues you see?
   - Which ones take the most time?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Any informal tracking / ticketing categories they use
> - Frequency estimates and confidence levels (“roughly”, “I’d guess”)
> - Repeat contacts and “stuck loops”

---

## Second Task: Walk through a recent support scenario end-to-end (workflow mapping) - 20 minutes

“Think of a recent situation you remember well (no personal details needed). A Veteran contacted you because they couldn’t get through ID.me verification or couldn’t sign in.”

1. **Intake**
   - What’s the first thing you try to understand?
   - What questions do you ask to determine where they’re stuck?

2. **Troubleshooting**
   - What steps do you typically try first?
   - What information do you need from the Veteran (without collecting anything sensitive today)?
   - What do you do if the Veteran has limited technology skills or limited device access?

3. **Workarounds + constraints**
   - What workarounds do you or your team use today?
   - What do you *wish* you could do to help but can’t (permissions, systems, policy, time)?

4. **Resolution**
   - What does success look like from your perspective?
   - How do you confirm the Veteran is fully unblocked (verified + can sign in + can access the intended VA service)?

5. **Follow-up + documentation**
   - Do you document these cases? Where?
   - Do you have any tags/categories for ID.me-related contacts?
   - How often does a “resolved” case come back as a repeat contact?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Where coordinators lose visibility after a handoff
> - Steps that are hard to do in real time (e.g., during a short appointment window)
> - Mentions of device/connectivity/accessibility barriers

---

## Third Task: Identify common failure modes + confusion points - 15 minutes

1. **What are the most common points of failure/confusion in the ID.me verification journey, as you observe it?**
   (Feel free to answer by listing categories and then examples.)
   - Document capture quality (lighting, glare, blur)
   - Document requirements / acceptable document types
   - Data mismatches (name, address, phone, date of birth)
   - Selfie / liveness issues
   - Browser/app confusion or camera permissions
   - MFA / one-time code issues
   - Account recovery (lost email, changed phone, new device)
   - Device constraints (no smartphone, shared device)
   - Accessibility barriers (vision, hearing, cognitive load)
   - Terminology confusion (“verify” vs “sign in” vs “create account”)

2. Which failure modes lead to the most frustration for Veterans?
   - Which ones lead to the most time/effort for you?
   
3. Are there any specific steps or messages that trigger “repeat contacts”?
   - What’s the pattern?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Misalignment between error messaging and actual next step
> - Confusion about whether the problem is VA vs ID.me
> - Accessibility/device constraints that make “standard” instructions unrealistic

---

## Fourth Task: Escalations + handoffs (and desired ID.me improvements) - 10 minutes

1. When you can’t resolve an ID.me issue directly, what escalation paths do you use?
   - To ID.me support
   - To VA help desks / internal channels
   - To local facility processes
   - Other

2. How do you decide when to escalate vs continue troubleshooting?
   - Are there “decision points” you rely on?

3. Where do escalations break down or slow down?
   - Long wait times
   - Unclear ownership
   - Not enough information to submit
   - Veteran drops off / can’t complete steps
   - No status visibility after handoff

4. What would make escalations smoother for you and Veterans?
   - Clearer decision tree
   - Better internal documentation
   - Standard “information packet” to send
   - Clearer escalation guidance and expectations

### ID.me improvement-focused questions

5. **What improvements would you like to see from ID.me so you can better support Veterans during the verification process?**
   (If helpful, think in terms of error clarity, accessibility, recovery, and support.)
   - Better error messages (plain language + what to do next)
   - Clearer “where the Veteran is” in the process (progress/status indicators)
   - More accessible verification options (low-vision, language, cognitive load)
   - Alternative pathways for people without smartphones/cameras
   - Better account recovery flows (email/phone/device changes)
   - Clearer document requirements and examples of acceptable docs
   - Easier handoff to live support (callback, appointment-based video, shorter wait)
   - Other

6. **When you’re helping a Veteran, what information do you wish you had from ID.me that you don’t have today?**
   - For example: why it failed, what step they’re on, what’s pending, or what the Veteran needs to do next.

7. **Are there any improvements ID.me could make that would reduce repeat contacts or “stuck loops”?**
   - What would success look like?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Distinguish “ID.me-owned” improvements vs “VA-owned” improvements
> - Requests that might conflict with policy/privacy (note them anyway as needs)
> - Improvement ideas tied directly to the failure modes discussed earlier

---

# Post-Task Interview / Wrap-up - 5 minutes

1. If you could change **one thing** about the overall verification/sign-in experience to reduce Veteran frustration, what would it be?

2. If you could change **one thing** to reduce your support burden or time-to-resolution, what would it be?

3. What content/tools/process changes would most reduce time-to-resolution and improve the Veteran experience?
   - Veteran-facing instructions and error guidance
   - Coordinator-facing troubleshooting playbook
   - Pre-appointment preparation materials (checklists)
   - Clearer escalation pathways / handoffs

4. If you could send ID.me a short prioritized list of changes, what would be your **top 3**?
   - Which would have the biggest impact on Veteran success rate?
   - Which would save you the most time?

5. Is there anything we didn’t ask that you think is important?

- Any questions for me?

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
  - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

  <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we work to reduce friction for Veterans trying to access VA online services.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy:
