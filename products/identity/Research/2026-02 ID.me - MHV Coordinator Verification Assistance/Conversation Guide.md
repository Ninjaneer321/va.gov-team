# Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[MODERATOR NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.

Today we're going to talk about your experience supporting Veterans with **ID.me sign-in and identity verification**, especially where Veterans get stuck, how you help, and what could improve the process.

Before we start, I have a few quick things to go over:

- **This session should take about 45 minutes.** I may move us along to make sure we cover everything.
- **We want your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers, and we’re not evaluating you or your performance.
- **Participation is voluntary.** You can skip any question or stop at any time.

- **Are you comfortable if I record audio (and my screen if needed) as we talk today?** We use recordings to confirm we captured your feedback accurately. We’ll summarize learnings without attributing them to you personally.

  <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, enable transcription/captions if available.

- **I have started recording.** To confirm, are you comfortable with me recording this conversation?

# Warm-up - 3 minutes

1. Could you describe your role and responsibilities in your own words?
   - How long have you been in this role?

2. How do Veterans typically reach you for help (phone, in-person, secure message, etc.)?
   - Does ID.me support differ depending on the channel?

---

## Task 1: Volume + segmentation of ID.me support requests - 7 minutes

1. In a typical week, about how many **ID.me-related** support cases do you handle?
   - About how many involve **verification not completing successfully** on the first try?

2. For the ID.me-related cases you see, how often are Veterans:
   - Verifying for the first time?
   - “Already have an ID.me account” but are blocked?

   *(Follow-up for clarity)* When someone “already has an account,” what’s most commonly going on?
   - Account exists but not identity-verified
   - Identity-verified but cannot sign in / link / access
   - Account recovery (lost email/phone/new device)
   - Something else?

3. What are the top 2–3 ID.me issues you see most often?
   - Which ones take the most time to resolve?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Any informal tracking / ticketing categories they use
> - Confidence level of estimates (“roughly”, “I’d guess”)
> - Repeat contacts / “stuck loops”

---

## Task 2: Walk through a recent support scenario end-to-end (workflow mapping) - 15 minutes

Think of a recent situation you remember well (no personal details needed). A Veteran contacted you because they couldn’t get through ID.me verification or couldn’t sign in.

1. **Intake / diagnosis**
   - What’s the first thing you try to understand?
   - What questions do you ask to determine where they’re stuck?

2. **Troubleshooting**
   - What steps do you typically try first?
   - What information do you need from the Veteran (without sharing any sensitive details today)?
   - What do you do if the Veteran has limited technology skills or limited device access?

3. **Workarounds + constraints**
   - What workarounds do you or your team use today when the “typical” steps don’t work?
   - Any major constraints that limit what you can do (policy/tools/time)?

4. **Closeout**
   - How do you know it’s resolved?
   - What do you document (if anything), and do you do any follow-up?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Where coordinators lose visibility after a handoff
> - Steps that are difficult in time-limited contexts (appointments, high call volume)
> - Device/connectivity/accessibility barriers that change what’s feasible

---

## Task 3: Common failure modes + highest-impact issues - 10 minutes

1. What are the most common points of failure or confusion in the ID.me verification journey, as you observe it?
   - Document capture quality (lighting, glare, blur)
   - Document requirements / acceptable document types
   - Data mismatches (name, address, phone, date of birth)
   - Selfie / liveness issues
   - Browser/app confusion or camera permissions
   - MFA / one-time code issues
   - Account recovery (lost email, changed phone, new device)
   - Device constraints (no smartphone, shared device)
   - Accessibility barriers (vision, hearing, cognitive load)
   - Terminology confusion (“verify” vs “sign in” vs “create account”)

2. Of the issues you listed, which 1–2 are highest impact (Veteran frustration, time-to-resolve, or repeat contacts)? Why?

3. *(If relevant)* Do any issues tend to create repeat contacts or “stuck loops”?
   - What usually breaks the loop (if anything)?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Misalignment between error messaging and the real next step
> - Confusion about whether the problem is VA vs ID.me
> - Any “critical moments” where Veterans drop off

---

## Task 4: Escalations / handoffs - 5 minutes

1. When you can’t resolve an ID.me issue directly, what escalation or handoff paths do you use?
   - To ID.me support
   - To VA help desks / internal channels
   - To local facility processes
   - Other

2. What triggers an escalation for you? (Decision points)
   - Are there categories of issues you escalate right away?

3. Where do escalations/handoffs most often break down or slow down?
   - What information is typically needed to escalate successfully?
   - What’s the impact on the Veteran and on you?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Lack of status visibility after handoff
> - Inconsistent paths or “it depends” rules
> - Missing info that causes rework

---

# Wrap-up: Prioritized improvements - 2 minutes

1. If you could ask **ID.me** for **three** improvements that would help you better support Veterans during verification, what would they be?
   - Please rank them (1 = most important).

2. If VA could change **one** thing on our side (guidance, tools, process, prep materials), what would help you most?

- Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Thank you again for your time—this was very helpful. Your input will help us map the coordinator support workflow and escalation paths, and prioritize improvements that reduce friction for Veterans and staff.

# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an emergency exit strategy:
https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html

Study-specific safety note (PII):
- If any Veteran PII appears on screen, ask the participant to stop sharing immediately and navigate away.
- Continue the session using a verbal walkthrough without screensharing.
