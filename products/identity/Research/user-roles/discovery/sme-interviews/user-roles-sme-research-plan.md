# Research Plan for Identity / Authenticated Experience, non-Veteran user roles, November 2021

## Background

As My HealtheVet and eBenefits move towards the VA.gov ecosystem, VA.gov will need to transition from exclusively serving Veterans to serving a wider audience, such as caregivers, spouses, partners, POAs, VSOs, etc.

Currently, what defines a “non-Veteran” and their use cases are not well understood across the VA. Each administration—VHA, VBA, and NCA—has their own unique definitions and nuances, which significantly increase the complexity of solving for the “non-Veteran” use case. Delegates, beneficiaries, caregivers, and dependents are a few terms used interchangeably that encompass many different user types relying on many different products and services across VA.

[Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/user-roles/discovery/README.md).

### OCTO Objectives 

1. Define all non-Veteran user roles for VHA, VBA, and NCA; identify the specific user types / roles, and what criteria a user needs to fit to qualify, according to each administration.
2. Translate administration-specific user roles into a VA-wide set of unified definitions, which encompasses all user types / roles.Identify use cases and outcomes for each of the non-Veteran user roles across VHA, VBA, and NCA.
3. Identify use cases and outcomes for each of the non-Veteran user roles across VHA, VBA, and NCA.

### Veteran Journey

This research is largely focused outside of the Veteran journey, given that we're seeking to learn more about non-Veterans.  The non-Veterans we are learning about may support Veterans through many stages of the Veteran journey, from Starting Up to Dying.

## Research Goals	

1. Understand the unique definitions and nuances each administration has for non-Veterans.
2. Define tasks each non-Veteran user type may need to complete for each administration.

### Outcome

This research will help us advance the authenticated experience in the following ways: 

- We'll be able to translate administration-specific user roles into a VA-wide set of unified definitions, which encompasses all user types / roles.  
- We'll understand the tasks non-Veterans need to complete on VA.gov.
- We'll be able to prioritize the non-Veteran user roles we can roll out on VA.gov.

### Research questions

1. What non-Veteran user roles does each administration serve?
2. What qualifies a person as a dependent or a beneficiary? How are those roles different?
3. What is the difference between POAs, CVSOs, VSOs, and claim agents, according to each administration?
4. What qualifies a person as a caregiver?
5. What are the tasks that each user type may need to do?

### Hypothesis

1. The non-Veteran user role buckets we already know about are correct: beneficiaries, caregivers, and Veteran advocates.
2. VA recognizes a person as a dependent based on how the Veteran claims the person on their taxes.
3. The primary task for beneficiaries and dependents is accessing documents showing their status with VA.
4. The primary tasks for caregivers will be health focused.
5. The landscape for Veteran advocates is significantly more complex than that of the other non-Veteran roles we'll hear about.



## Method	

We'll conduct semi-structured interviews with VA stakeholders over Zoom.

### Research materials

- [Link to conversation guides](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/user-roles/discovery/sme-interviews/conversation-guides) 

## Recruitment	

We're recruiting stakeholders at each administration through our VEO and OCTO colleagues, and reaching out via email to schedule sessions.

## Timeline

We'll conduct interviews the first two weeks of November, 2021.  A schedule of sessions can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/user-roles/discovery/sme-interviews/README.md).


### Length of sessions

Interviews will be 30-45 minutes.

- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	Liz Lantz
- Project point of contact:	Liz Lantz
- Observers: Samara Strauss, Heather Justice, AJ Jackabcin, Cody Reinhold, John Rahaghi
