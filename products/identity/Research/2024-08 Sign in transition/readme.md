## Background

We want to use the unified sign in page and the sign in modal to help encourage folks to make the transition from the MHV and DSL legacy credentials that are being sunset. Our design exploration especially includes de-emphasizing the legacy credentials, and adding content about how to transition to one of the modern credential options (LIG and IDme). We'll also test an interstitial that could be used to escalate communications, to focus of the interstitial testing will be proposed content and flow.

## Research Goals:
- Explore veterans thinking around ceratin terms and phrases relating to sign in and credential migration
- Test the usability of a prototype for the sign in page and/or sign in modal
