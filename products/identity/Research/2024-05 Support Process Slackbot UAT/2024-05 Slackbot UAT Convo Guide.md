# Slackbot UAT - Conversation Guide

## Starting the Session | 3 min

Thank you for taking some time with us today!

[Intro self and team]

We asked you to chat and test out a flow for requesting identity support, because you’d recently posted in the VSP-Identity slack channel asking for support from our team. Our team has been working on a more formal process to fielding support requests to help make sure all are addressed in a timely manner.

A couple of points before we get started
- We aren’t testing you or your abilities, but you are helping us test a possible solution
- We want to hear your honest opinions. We welcome and appreciate your candid feedback.
- In case we have any questions with our notes we need to check, we’d like to record this session today. Are you ok if we start recording?

## Intention setting Q’s | 5 min

- Can you take me through your thinking about when you made a request in VSP-Identity
   - Anythign from where you went, who you asked, what you asked and such?
- It doesn’t have to be perfectly chronological, but I’d especially like to hear anything that starts with you and your team discovering you needed some Identity support to having that support request resolved or fulfilled.
   - [follow-ups as needed]
      - Would you ever search Google? a team's Slack Docs? for that type of question?
- If you need help or support from another team how do you figure out how to initiate that?
   - Before posting in VSP-Idenetity did you seek support in any other way?
      - Like did you search for an answer before posting in VSP-Identity?
   - How often do you go to the Canvas page on another team’s slack channel?


Thanks for filling in that context

## Activity | 10 min
[UAT test cases](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Request%20&%20Support%20Process/UAT_MVP.md)
- Now we’d like for you to take us through how you might request support in the new process.
- At this point we’ll ask that you share your screen, and in particular we are interested in seeing your Slack window. You can bring up the VSP-Identity channel if you want to make sure you don’t have any private or sensitive channels showing.


   - [if would, then use that as the prompt - saw slackbot in our Canvas]
   - [if wouldn’t, then use the following]
      - Let say that you started in the same way you did last time - going to VSP-Identity channel and message a request. Someone then asks you to use the slash command to request through the slackbot. 
         - Is that a clear instruction?
         - What would make it more understandable?

Ok, so now you are typing in the slash command. Let’s say you are need the same support as the last time you requested support from Identity. <br>
[if don’t remember, then any type of support that would make sense for their team]

[As they look through the first drop down]<br>
Can you explain to me what you are are thinking when you see each of these drop down options?

[after submitting the ticket]
- I’m going to have you go to another screen now, if you are in the General or Random channels either of those would be fine, or any channel that’s ok to have up on screen while we are recording.
- Ok so we’ll imaging that some time has gone by and you want to check in on the support request that you made. Where are you going to look first?
   - If Slack - did you realize that a GitHub ticket was created for you?
   - If GH - if you’ve ever used Platform support, do you always look back to GH?
- If you have additional questions or context you want to add to an issue, where would you address that?
   - [maybe in GitHub or the Slack thread?]
- What should happen when a ticket is closed?
   - [Does you get notified in Slack or is the ticket simply closed (and by whom)?]

We would like you to submit one other request type while we have you.<br>
[choose another of the request types, DON'T CHOOSE SIS]


## Wrap-up | 10 min

- Does anyone one else on my team have any questions?
- Does [participant] have any questions for our team?
- We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Thank you, and enjoy the rest of your day!
