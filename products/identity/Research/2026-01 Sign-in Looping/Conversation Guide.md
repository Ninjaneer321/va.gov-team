# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about your experiences signing in to VA.gov and VA mobile apps. Specifically, we're interested in learning about any issues you may have encountered when trying to access your account.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
  
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - <mark>**If no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.</mark>
   - **If yes:** Admit observers.
     
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
     
- **During our conversation, I may ask you to show me how you sign in to VA.gov.** If you're comfortable doing so, you can share your screen with me. <mark>**Please note that when you share your screen, I'll be able to see your personal information. You can choose what to share, and you can stop sharing at any time. Nothing you share will affect your VA benefits or account.**</mark>
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans' experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we dive into the details, let's start with a few questions about your general experience with VA.gov.

1. How often do you typically visit VA.gov or use VA mobile apps?
   - What do you usually go there to do?

2. Which sign-in option do you typically use? (Login.gov or ID.me)
   - Have you tried using different sign-in methods?
   - If yes: Which one do you prefer and why?

3. In general, how would you describe your experience signing in to VA.gov?

## First Task: Understanding the Looping Experience - 15 minutes

Now I'd like to talk about the specific issue you've experienced when trying to sign in.

1. Can you walk me through what happens when you try to sign in and experience this problem?
   - Where are you trying to sign in? (VA.gov homepage, specific tool, mobile app?)
   - What are you trying to access when this happens?

2. You mentioned experiencing [looping/being returned to the sign-in page/authentication issues]. Can you describe in detail what you see on your screen when this happens?
   - What's the first thing you notice that tells you something isn't working?
   - After you enter your credentials, what happens next?
   - Do you see any error messages? If yes, what do they say?

3. How many times does this cycle repeat before you give up or try something different?
   - Does it ever resolve itself? If yes, how?

4. When this issue occurs, do you notice any pattern to what's happening? For example:
   - Does the page refresh or redirect?
   - Do you see a loading screen?
   - Are you taken back to the exact same page, or do you progress partway through the sign-in process?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Specific terminology the participant uses to describe the experience
> - Whether they're returned to the initial sign-in page or stuck at a different point in authentication
> - Whether they see any error messages or codes
> - Understanding of where in the authentication flow the issue occurs
> - Any pattern recognition from the participant's perspective

## Second Task: Technical Context and Patterns - 15 minutes

I'd like to understand more about the technical details of when this happens to you.

1. What device were you using when you last experienced this issue?
   - Computer, tablet, or phone?
   - If computer: Mac or PC?
   - If phone/tablet: iPhone/iPad or Android?

2. What web browser do you use? (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
   - Do you experience this issue on all browsers or just one?
   - Are you using the browser's latest version?

3. When does this issue typically occur?
   - Does it happen every time you try to sign in, or only sometimes?
   - If sometimes: Can you think of any differences between times when it works versus times when it doesn't?
   - Time of day? Day of the week?
   - On a specific network? (home WiFi, mobile data, public WiFi, work network)

4. Is there anything else happening on your device when this occurs?
   - Do you have multiple VA.gov tabs or windows open?
   - Are you using a VPN or any security software?
   - Do you have browser extensions or ad blockers enabled?

5. **[If participant is comfortable and available]** Would you be willing to try signing in now and share your screen so I can see what you're experiencing?
   - <mark>**Only proceed if participant explicitly agrees and seems comfortable**</mark>
   - <mark>**Remind participant they can stop sharing at any time**</mark>

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Consistency in environment (same device, browser, network)
> - Any common technical factors across instances
> - Whether issue is isolated to specific authentication method
> - Participant's awareness of their viewing their personal information on screen
> - Any technical workarounds they've discovered

## Third Task: Attempted Solutions and Impact - 10 minutes

Let's talk about what you've tried to do to resolve this issue.

1. What have you tried to fix this problem?
   - Examples: clearing cache/cookies, different browser, different device, different sign-in method, calling help desk
   - Which of these worked, if any?
   - Which didn't work?

2. Have you contacted VA support about this issue?
   - If yes: What did they suggest? Did it help?
   - If no: Why not?

3. How does this issue affect your use of VA.gov?
   - Are there things you need to do that you can't access because of this?
   - How often does this prevent you from accessing something you need?
   - What do you do instead when you can't sign in?

4. On a scale of 1-10, how frustrating is this experience for you?
   - Can you tell me more about why you chose that number?

> [!NOTE]
> ### Things to watch for:
> - Effectiveness of different troubleshooting approaches
> - Whether certain solutions consistently work
> - Impact on accessing critical VA services
> - Workarounds that might hide the actual frequency of the issue
> - Emotional impact and trust in VA digital services

# Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Is there anything else about your sign-in experience that we haven't covered but you think is important for us to know?

- If you could fix one thing about signing in to VA.gov, what would it be?

- Have you experienced similar issues signing in to other websites or services, or is this unique to VA.gov?

- Any questions for me?

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. The information you've shared will help us identify and fix this sign-in issue so other Veterans don't have to experience the same frustration.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). 

**Option 1:** "I really appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us today. It looks like we've covered all the questions I had for you. Thank you so much for your time and feedback."

**Option 2 (If participant becomes frustrated or distressed):** "I can see this is bringing up some frustrating experiences. I want to be respectful of your time and emotions. We can stop here if you'd like. The information you've already shared is very helpful."
