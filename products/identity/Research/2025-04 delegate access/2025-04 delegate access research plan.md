# **Research Plan for Identity Experience, delegate access \- combined plan**

## **Background**

Delegates include multiple roles at VA, and some of those presently have online access to complete a tasks on behalf of a Veteran. Caregiver role doesn't have a way to help manage a Veteran's care online after the deprecation and removal of MHV sign-in. We know, anecdotally that some informal caregivers would sign into a VA account as a Veteran using shared sign in credentials, this is not allowed with ID.me or Login.gov. We need to verify if this assumed need of an informal caregiver needing access to a Veteran's VA account to help manage healthcare needs is accurate, and if so, discover the best way to solve for this need.

### **OCTO Identity Crew Objectives**

* Objective 1: Create a smooth transition for Veterans from legacy to modern sign-in credentials  
* Objective 2: Improve the Veteran sign-in experience.

### **Veteran Journey**

Securely accessing VA online services on behalf of a Veteran that isn’t oneself can happen at any stage in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). But may be most likely to initiate in “starting up,” “taking care of myself,” and “aging.” The updated Sign-in page and modal will apply to everyone who signs into VA online and uses the authenticated experience.

## **Research Goals**

- Determine an informal caregiver's level of need to access VA.gov on behalf of a Veteran online
- Discover how informal caregivers would need or want to access VA.gov on behalf of Veterans  
- Explore how folks might be interested in interacting with audit logs  
- Answer questions about and verify our understanding of the complete user journey for informal caregivers

**Outcome**
Learn about the process of how delegates gain access to help a Veteran manage their healthcare, and how a Veteran might change caregivers or stop needed one.

### **Research questions**

- Who are most likely to be informal caregivers?
- What level of access to a Veteran's account is the right amount?
- What actions on VA.gov does a caregiver need the most?
- What are delegate users’ needs and expectations around audit logs?
- How would a Veteran expect to offboard an informal caregiver from having access to their account?


### **Hypotheses**

- H1: Informal caregivers don't always formally register with the VA to act on behalf of a Veteran for VA business 
- H2: Informal caregivers only need access to health care related actions on a Veteran's account, not their entire account
- H3: Informal caregivers want access online to a Veteran's VA account.


## **Methodology**

Interview VA personnel who help establish guardian access

Interview caregivers who currently or previously have helped take care of a Veteran

Interview Veterans who currently or previously have had a caregiver help them manage their care at VA

## **Recruitment**

### **Recruitment approach**

We will have 3 cohorts for this remote, moderated study.
- Cohort 1 will be self-recruit VA employees
- Cohort 2 will use Perigean to recruit caregivers who currently or previously have helped a Veteran manage their care at VA
- cohort 3 will use Perigean to recruit veterans who currently or previously have relied on a caregiver

We assume that these cohorts will be limited in size, so we will not specifically target underrepresented groups in this study.
