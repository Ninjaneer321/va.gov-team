# Research Plan Metadata
title: "Research Plan for Identity Experience, Delegate Access - Caregivers (preliminary conversations), April 2025"
date: 2025-04-14
last_updated: 2025-04-14
team: "Identity Experience"
product: "Delegate Access MVP"
product_area: "authenticated"

# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "Caregivers are given permission by Veterans to manage the care or personal affairs of Veterans. We are having preliminary conversations with caregivers, in order to understand their digital needs and uncover any potential pain points as they navigate the VA."
  product_location: "VA.gov authentication and delegate access features"
  user_familiarity: "New - preliminary discovery research"
  product_brief_url: "https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/delegate-access%20#initiative-outline-delegate-access-mvp"

# Research Design
methodology: "Semi-structured interviews"
research_format: 
  location: remote
  moderated: true
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Discover how caregivers are able to access Veteran services behalf of Veterans"
  - goal_2: "Explore how caregivers interact with VA.gov or other digital services"
  - goal_3: "Better understand and empathize with the caregiver journey and uncover any potential pain points as they navigate the VA"

research_questions:
  - "Which methods does the caregiver utilize to complete actions on behalf of the Veteran?"
  - "Is the caregiver given digital access?"
  - "What functions do caregivers do on behalf of the Veteran most frequently?"
  - "How is a delegate currently authorized and designated as a caregiver? What actions must the Veteran take?"
  - "How might a Veteran assign permissions for a caregiver? For what period of time is the designation active?"

hypotheses:
  - "Veterans can designate specific permissions that caregivers may have."
  - "Caregivers do not currently have access to digitally complete actions on behalf of the Veteran they are caring for."
  - "Caregivers have a desire to leverage digital tools to complete actions on behalf of Veterans."
  - "Non-digital mechanisms for accessing healthcare benefits are difficult to maneuver."
  - "With the deprecation of MHV, there has been a significant roadblock for representatives/caregivers to digitally monitor and complete actions for Veterans in their care."

expected_outcomes: "Learn about the process of how caregivers are able to complete various tasks and functions on behalf of Veterans. The focus is anything from the point of being designated by the Veteran all the way through completion of any actions behalf of a Veteran."
