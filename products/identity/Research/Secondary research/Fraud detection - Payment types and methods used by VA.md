## Summary of payment methods used by VA.gov


Disability Benefits


Direct Deposit is commonly used for disability compensation and pension benefits.
Veterans receive their payments directly into their bank accounts.
This method ensures timely and secure disbursement of funds.


Pension Benefits


Similar to disability benefits, direct deposit is the primary method for pension benefits.
Veteransâ€™ pension payments are electronically transferred to their bank accounts.  (VA.gov)


Most Education Benefits


Direct Deposit is also utilized for most education benefits.
Veterans pursuing education receive their payments directly into their bank accounts.
This includes benefits such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill and other educational assistance programs.


STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Benefits


An outlier in the education category.
Despite being an education benefit, STEM benefits still use direct deposit for compensation and pension payments.
This ensures consistency with other benefit disbursements.


VETTEC (Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses) Benefits


Another outlier within education benefits.
VETTEC benefits also rely on direct deposit for compensation and pension payments.
The focus remains on efficient and secure fund distribution.


Travel Claims
Beneficiary Travel Self-Service System (BTSSS)


Medical Benefits


Life Insurance Policies & Dividends


Automobile Allowance

Recent Changes: Benefit Payments
As of April 20, 2024, the VA has transitioned to a streamlined approach for distributing payments related to disability compensation, pension, and education benefits. All payments are now consolidated into a single bank account, aiming to bolster security and minimize fraud risks.
