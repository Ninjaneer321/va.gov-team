# About this Research

- [Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/login/sign-in-ctas/README.md)

## Background
We want to regularly check in on qualitative data. This will help us uncover painpoints and other areas of improvement in our products and give us a view of how our products are doing overall. 

## Planned Timeline
About every quarter we plan to request new survey and support data from the Veteran Support (aka Contact Center team)

| Date of data pull | Data requested | Date of request | Request ticket
| --- | ---| --- | --- |
| Jan - Apr 2024 | Medallia, survey | May 7 | [82577](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/82577) |
