## Background
- Review and analyze Medallia feedback related to the /verify page to identify potential friction, error patterns, or user frustrations. This analysis will help us better understand how users are interacting with the page, especially as traffic increases through VEO emails, interstitials, or USiP flows. 


## Methodology 

We requested survey data for May and June from the Contact Center Team.

* Medallia feedback survey - folks get to this by pressing the "feedback" button at the bottom of a page on VA.gov
* Medallia intercept survey - folks get to this by seeing a pop-up on screen
* We asked for surveys that were started from va.gov/verify and pages related to verify content
  * No results retuend from /verify, so this analysis relies only on resource pages about verify
