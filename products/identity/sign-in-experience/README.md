## Overview

The user-facing sign-in experience covers all elements of the frontend experience of signing into VA.gov and the VA Health and Benefits app, including:

- The unified sign-in page 
- End-to-end sign-in flows
- Sign-in widgets found throughout VA.gov

Historically, [the sign-in experience on VA.gov is one of the lowest-rated experiences on VA.gov](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1030131175?userId=66061986). Over time, our team hopes to mitigate that and drastically improve the experience of signing into VA.gov.

## User Problem Statement

- As a veteran, I want to quickly, easily, and securely sign into VA.gov and the VA Health and Benefits mobile app.
- As a veteran, I want to be able to switch between different VA websites without having to sign in more than once.
- As a veteran, I want to be able to quickly and easily verify my identity to access my personal information with VA.
- As a veteran, I want to be able to quickly fix any issues I have with sign in.
  
## Credential Service Providers (CSPs)

Currently, the universal sign-in page support four CSPs:

- ID.me
- Login.gov
- DS Logon
- My HealtheVet

- Maintaining, iterating on, and updating the unified sign in page
- Providing a consistent experience with sign-in widgets found throughout VA.gov
