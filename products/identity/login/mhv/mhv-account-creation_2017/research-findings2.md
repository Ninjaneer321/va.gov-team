# Rx Tracking and Account Creation Research Findings

Week of May 15, 2017

The goal is to validate that with our mockup a Veteran can track their package and understand different parts of the page.
The goal is see if Veterans understand and agree to the health terms and conditions on Vets.gov to get access to Rx, SM and BB.

## Key research questions:

Can the Veteran identify where to track their prescription? Is the information on the page clear? Can they identify the difference between view history (viewing an old medicine), tracking their package and the prescription details? Does the Veteran understand what else is in their order? Does the Veteran know how to find more information about the package? (USPS) Does the Veteran know what dispense date is?

Does the Veteran accept the terms and conditions? Does the Veteran understand what tools are available if they accept the terms and conditions? Is the information on the page clear? Do they know why they are being asked to complete terms and conditions? Do they know where to find the information/change their answer at a later time? (Profile page) What do they think of the experience?

We spoke with 5 Veterans.

The conversation guide can be found here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/login/mhv/mhv-account-creation/mhv-upgrade/research/conversationguide2.md

## Key Takeaways
- Users did not read the terms and conditions and tried to click the agree button/checkbox immediately without scrolling.
- Users understood why they were being asked to accept terms and conditions. Users saw the bullet points at the top which told them the tools they were getting access to. 
- It was clear what prescriptions were in the package.

## What worked
- Users were about to refill their prescription.
- Users were able to easily track their package.
- Users were about to find more details on their prescription.

## What didn't work
- It was not clear that if you select health care benefits you could get to a list of prescriptions.
- It was not clear that the user needed to scroll before they could accept the terms and conditions.
