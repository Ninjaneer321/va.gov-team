# Discovery Project Brief & Planning Template

This doc should be filled out during different stages of the discovery sprint process. See the [Discovery Sprint How-to](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) for details on the whole process.

* This is not a full discovery sprint as parts of this (10-5345a form) have already had a discovery sprint.

## PROJECT BRIEF
_To be filled out with a Vets.gov lead prior to starting discovery work._

### Project Name
MHV/Non-MHV Account Creation 

### Problem Statement / How Might We statements
How do we let non-mhv Veterans (and Veterans without a premium account) access health tools on Vets.gov? 

### What Sprint Teams Are Associated with this Discovery? 
* Kudos

### Discovery Sprint Roles

* Product Lead:Natalie 
* Engineer:Kam 
* Designer:Angel
* Researcher:Natalie


### Stakeholders
* VA business owner: Carnetta 


## DISCOVERY PLANNING

### Project Details

We need to have a terms of conditions and a way for Veterans to provide consent to their medical records.  Identifying the best way to do this will let non-mhv Veterans access health tools on Vets.gov. 

### Timeline
See also: [sample discovery sprint schedule](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/sample-discovery-sprint-schedule.md).

* Are there any hard and fast deadlines for completing the discovery work?
We are planning on launching this in early June.
