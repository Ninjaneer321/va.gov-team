| 12/13/24    | Data Quality | On 12/11, the MHV team reported anomalies in the IAM dataset. We investigated this as part of [SIT-423](https://jira.devops.va.gov/browse/SIT-423). For the 2 ICNs that MHV provided, the issue is due to users getting new ICNs. MHV dataset includes some ICNs which have subsequently been "replaced". In these two cases, the MHV dataset includes both old and new. The impact is that this increases the denominator and also inflates the number of users with no modern credentials. There were 1,683 Veteran records readily identifiable as fitting this category. However, the same issue likely applies to some of the ~450K ICNs that MHV is reporting having MHV credentials but not in AuthDB. This is likely something for the MHV team to resolve to clean up the legacy ICNs. | We are counting invalid ICNs included in the MHV dataset, which is inflating the set of users with no modern credentials. We suspect this is on MHV's side to fix.                                                                         | Open           |
| 12/13/24    | Data Quality | There are ~90K records that don't have any credentials but the ICNs are in AuthDB. From a spot check, many are MHV records, but MHV isn't reporting that the user has a credential, so MHV takes preference. In other cases, users have some legacy credentials in AuthDB that are filtered out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Does not affect the Domo dashboard, but they are in the dataset being uploaded to CDW. These users are not matched to any credentials and are filtered out on our side because MHV is our authoritative source on MHV users.                | Open  |
