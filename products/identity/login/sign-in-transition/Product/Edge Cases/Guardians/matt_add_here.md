## Background  
As part of the VAâ€™s sign-in transition effort, the VA is interested in understanding how Court-Appointed Guardians are handled in the private healthcare sector. To better craft a desirable experience for Veterans and their Guardians, we will assess how guardians gain access to records and digital systems from private sector providers and insurance companies.

## Scope of Exploration  
- Kaiser Permanente  
- Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield  
- Athena Health  
- My Chart by Epic  
- UP Health System  

## Private Sector  

### Legal Documentation  
The guardian would first ensure they have all necessary legal documentation proving their guardianship. This usually includes a court order or letters of guardianship issued by the court.

### Requesting Information & Access from Providers  

#### Hospitals and Clinics  
The guardian would come in person to the medical records department or health information management department of hospitals, clinics, or any healthcare provider where the ward has records. They present their court-appointed guardianship documents. Many healthcare providers have forms or procedures for guardians or those with power of attorney to access medical records.

#### Electronic Health Records (EHR)  
If the provider uses an EHR system, the guardian might need to be registered within that system. Some systems allow for proxy access, where guardians can have their own login credentials to access the patient's records.

### Requesting Information & Access from Insurance Companies  

#### Authorization Forms and Legal Proof  
Guardians might need to fill out specific authorization forms required by the insurance company to access any digital health information or billing records. Similar to healthcare providers, insurance companies will require legal proof of guardianship before granting access to any records or information systems.

#### Claims, Billing, EOBs, Etc  
Similar to EHRs from providers, guardians may be able to gain proxy access to the digital systems.

### Digital Platforms and Portals  
The guardian would:
- Register or gain access to the patient's account, using their legal authority. This might involve setting up an account or getting the credentials from the patient if they had one set up before incapacity.
- If the platform supports it, there might be features for caregivers or guardians, allowing them separate access levels.

## Summary  
Due to the fragmentation in private sector health, the process and access can vary
