## Solution approach

- Danielle to update content
- Start conversations with design system
- One final review of content and use cases
- Work with design system to get the content into the design system
- Start working with teams to implement content
  - We need to see if we have an audit/list of what pages need to be updated so we can track accordingly
  - Identity will coordinate this and work with teams over time. Teams will implement their own changes, and identity witll validate that these updates have been made accordingly.

### Key dates

- Spring 2024: CAIA/Danielle rewrote sign-in and verification CTA content and shared with identity.
- June 2024: Samara and Danielle starting to coordinate on sign-in and verification CTA work.
