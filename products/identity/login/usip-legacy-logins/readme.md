## POCs

### OCTO teams

This work involves the following teams:

- Identity
- CAIA
- Other VA.gov content/tool owners
- Design system team

## Overview
With MHV credentials due to become inactive on January 31, 2025 and DSlogon credentials due to become inactive on September 30th, 2025. it is incumbent that we use the USiP to make the transition for Veterans who use those credentials as simply as possible.  Strategies for this include:

- De-emphazising the legacy credentials on the USiP
- Messaging to Veterans who use those credentials that they will need to transition to either Login.gov and/or ID.me prior to
- Explaining the processes for signing up for ID.me or Login.gov


## User problem statements

- As a Veteran who currently uses MHV or DSlogon to sign-in to VA.gov, I would like to understand when using MHV & DSlogon logins will no longer be used so that I might switch to ID.me or Login.gov and continue to access my benefits.
- As a Veteran who currently uses MHV or DSlogon to login to VA.gov, I would like to understand how to use either ID.me or Login.gov in order to continue to access my benefits.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes
* Veterans understand the situation and switch en massse to either ID.me or Login.gov and the deadlines for MHV and DSLogon pass without incident.



### Undesired User Outcomes

* Chaos and disorder at both the MHV and DSLogon deadlines; call center swamped with outraged Vets who suddenly can't sign-in; Congressional investigation into the situation.
