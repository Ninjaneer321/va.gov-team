# Identity Team UX Research Intake Process

1. A new finding or – more likely –  a series of findings are created by the UX team. The findings will have some kind of research or documentation behind them.  
2. The UX team presents their findings to other members of the Identity Team  leading to a discussion of the feasibility of turning the findings into tasks.  There might be several tasks coming from a single finding. For each task, we should be able to answer the following questions:
   - Why is this important?	
   - What is the data behind it?
   - How will it benefit our customers?
3. Those tasks will be examined in terms of impact and level of effort by members of the Identity team – the PM(s), plus team members who made the initial findings, as well as engineering – each task will be prioritized into one of three true outcomes:
   - The task will be worked on as soon as resources are available.  
     - Either a new Epic is created or – more likely – the task added to an existing Epic.
   - The task will be worked on in the future.
     - Foundation of a future Product Brief or added to an existing Epic.
   - The task is fully deprioritized, and will never be worked upon.
