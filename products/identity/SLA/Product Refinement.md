# Product Refinement

On Friday, April 15, 2024 the Identity Team had our first product refinement for the Login SLA project.  It was focused around this Problem Statement:

_We do not currently have any current Service Level Agreements for VA.gov logins, and publishing them -- as well as dashboards that visualize key data -- will help us monitor and improve the Veteran login experience._

We also brainstormed around two high-level User Stories

* As a VA Team Member, I would like to see high-level data visualizations related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so that I am provided with immediate, comprehensive information about the status of services that I am using.
* As a VA Team member, I would like to see service level agreements related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so I can understand what to expect from those services.
