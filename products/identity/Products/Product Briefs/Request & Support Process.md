# Request & Support Process

## Overview: 

Top Goals:  One of our 2024 OKRs is develop an Identity Team Request & Support process for va.gov, which will help us help other teams far more efficiently than currently.

* Create an intake process for feature requests, updates, bug fixes, data requests, etc.
* Allow folks to self-service (access pre-existing materials/answers/FAQ's as much as possible)
* Ability to view all requests holistically

Create solutions to manage & fulfill requests from other va.gov Product Teams, possibly including:
* Intake form
* Summation of the work we need to do

Potential add-ons (but not primary goal)
* Estimate of the time it will take (post initial in-take)
* Prioritization of the request vs. other requests (should be out of scope, dependent of PRODUCT prioritization)

## Problem Statement: 
Currently, we have no clearcut and a disjointed/one-off process to field requests from other product teams.  In order to triage, manage and fulfill those requests, we need to clearly define a workflow/process in order to be able to track the overall workload created by those requests.

## Relevant Documents:
- [UX Brainstorm & Research](https://app.mural.co/t/oddballinternal7486/m/oddballinternal7486/1706233585959/51586c97a249268a2ff9a709024dcd9df18dc6f8?sender=u8f85d3b7f2143f85bb7a9248) 
- Final documents generated by this project will live in the [Request & Support folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/Products/Request%20%26%20Support%20Process)
## Potential deliverables:
- research findings

## What's In Scope: 
For this first iteration, the focus will be on developing the processes as needed to support other teams' requests. For MVP, we've focused on three types of requests
- PR Review
- Data pulls
- Mocked Auth issues

These were chosen because these are requests that our team unambiguously fulfills, and we believe that if we run these cases through the full request and support process, we can then expand it to understand other kinds of requests.

## Out of Scope: 
*  Sign-in-Service documentation updates
*  Sign-in-Service bug/feature resolution
*  Request types that aren't the three listed above.

## Use Cases:
| User          | Problem       | How does this solution address the problem?  |

|Va.gov product team member| Want to ask a data pull| [Slackbot form will standardize data pull request](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77443)  |
|Va.gov product team member | Want to ask for PR review  | [Slackbot form will standardize PR review request](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77415) | 
|Va.gov product team member  | Having issues with Mock Auth   | [Slackbot form will standardize Mock Auth issue request](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77444) |

|Identity team member | No standardized language to communicate with users  | [Standardized language for each part of the process](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77495) |
|Identity team member | I don't have a top-level view of the requests | [Slackbot will create tickets that will live in a tracker](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/74677)



## Assumptions:
* We leverage previous experience supporting other teams to create this process.

## Solution Approach: 
* We piggyback off of the slackbot developed for the SiS Project and use it to expand the range of requests captured. The slackbot will respond to the _/help_ command in the #vfs-identity channel
