# VA.gov Login SLO Phase 2

## Overview: 
Determining, establishing and publishing the Service Level Objective (SLO) targets we want to hit for Veterans logging into VA.gov with the ultimate goal of continuously improving the login process to VA.gov. 

We have two audiences for this information:
* Veterans logging into va.gov
* Other va.gov product teams.

## Problem Statement: 
We do not currently have any current SLOs for VA.gov logins, and creating them will help us monitor and improve the Veteran login experience.

## Relevant Documents:
* [Login SLO Epic](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/75713)
* [va.gov Status Page](https://vagov.statuspage.io/)
* [SLO Brainstorm on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/RFJBhEtGHVnWUOAGn1Gnl8/SLO-Brainstorm?type=whiteboard&node-id=0-1&t=3vuj1urgEUrWjBCo-0)

## What's In Scope: 
* Incident Response
* Service Level Agreements
* Accountability in SLOs - who gets assigned & their impact toward total numbers
* Automation
  *  Notify when investigations are happening.
  *  Slack notifications when SLOs reach a certain level.
* How we will publish the agreements to other teams.
  * Perhaps just posting a single SLO doc used by all teams in Github (rather than doing it per team)?
