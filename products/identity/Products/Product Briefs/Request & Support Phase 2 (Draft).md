# Request & Support Process Phase 2

## Overview: 

Top Goals:  One of our 2024 OKRs is develop an Identity Team Request & Support process for va.gov, which will help us help other teams far more efficiently than currently.

* Create an intake process for feature requests, updates, bug fixes, data requests, etc.
* Allow folks to self-service (access pre-existing materials/answers/FAQ's as much as possible)
* Ability to view all requests holistically
  
For the MVP we leveraged the Slackbot already in development for Sign-In Service requests, and added the following kinds of requests:
- PR Review
- Data pulls
- Test User Authentication Issues
The rationale was that these were requests that were unambiguously supported by the identity team, and we could fully

In addition, we created:
- A Github page to to explain how to request support from identity.
- Github Support Template
- Documentation that explained how we supported each of the three kinds of requests detailed above.
- Satisfaction Survey

## Problem Statement: 
Now that we have an MVP of the Request & Support out in the world

## Potential deliverables:
- Research findings
- A slackbot to take requests
- A request fulfillment process
- Request tracking

## What's In Scope (MVP): 



These were chosen because these are requests that our team unambiguously fulfills, and we believe that if we run these cases through the full request and support process, we can then expand it to understand other kinds of requests.

## Out of Scope (MVP): 
*  Request types that aren't the three listed above.
*  Deflection & self service, outside of links to documentation.
*  Communication from Github to the ID Bot
   * Notifying the thread automatically when, say, someone picked up the ticket
*   Creating metrics to start tracking how we are doing
     

## Use Cases:
| User          | Problem       | Solution to their Problem |
| :------------- |:------------- | :----- |
|Va.gov product team member| Want to ask a data pull| [Slackbot form will standardize data pull request](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77443)  |
|Va.gov product team member | Want to ask for PR review  | [Slackbot form will standardize PR review request](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77415) | 
|Va.gov product team member  | Having issues with Mock Auth   | [Slackbot form will standardize Mock Auth issue request](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77444) |
|Identity team member | Which request should we focus on?  | [Create a Triage/Prioritization process](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77491) |
|Identity team member | No standardized language to communicate with users  | [Standardized language for each part of the process](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/77495) |
|Identity team member | I don't have a top-level view of the requests | [Slackbot will create tickets that will live in a tracker](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/identity-5f5bab705a94c9001ba33734/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/74677)



## Assumptions:
* We leverage previous experience supporting other teams to create this process.

## Solution Approach: 
* We piggyback off of the slackbot developed for the SiS Project and use it to expand the range of requests captured. The slackbot will respond to the _/help_ command in the #vfs-identity channel. For MVP, it will have the following choices:
  - Test User Authentication Help
  - Sign-In Service Integration
  - PR Review Request
  - Data Request
  - Other

We obviously won't worry about Sign-In Service, as that has it's own flow, but "Other" will be useful in determining what choices we want to add next.

  
## Technical Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Slackbot / Github Connection | Right now, we can have slack can write to github, but not vice versa        |
| Potential Move to Jira | If/when we move to Jira, how much of this work will be duplicated? |

## UX/ Research Ideas Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Gather Metrics from Slack  |               |
| Survey from Team  |               |
| Inventory of Methods used for intake across VA teams  |               |


## Measuring Success:
Measuring the success of the Request & Support process project will be part of the focus of an entire project: O4KR2 - Establish and publish monthly metrics around response times for VA.gov product teams.

That said, some initial thoughts on what that project might entail.
| KPI           | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Number of requests | On a monthly basis, we track how many requests were fulfilled via the Request & Support | 
| Percentage of requests | On a monthly basis, we track the percentage of requests that were fulfilled via the Request & Support tracker |
| Customer Satisfaction | Create a customer satisfaction survey



## Baseline KPI Values:
