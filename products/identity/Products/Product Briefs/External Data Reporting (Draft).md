# External Data Reporting (Draft)

## Overview: 
There are basically two goals of this project:

- Understand what kind of user data VA Leadership wants from the Identity Team.
- Display and explain the user data in a way that is easy to understand and report upon.

## Problem Statement: 
The data produced by the Identity Team is often not instantly understandable and can be misrepresented or misinterpreted.  We need to find out what kind of data VA Leadership finds useful, and create a way for them to access that data on a regular basis.

Understand what people find useful, our audience is, what data is important to each audience.

Define what the data is, get them closest to what they're looking for.

Simple sets of user data -- agreed-to by the entire team, tell our story, properly


## Relevant Documents:  (Joe's notes)
[Current VA.Gov Identy Stats Datadog Dashboard](https://vagov.ddog-gov.com/dashboard/e3q-6kp-9r4/vagov-identity-stats-public?fromUser=false&refresh_mode=sliding&view=spans&from_ts=1710610618968&to_ts=1713202618968&live=true)


- Settle on definitions for data

- We need a single set of definitions around the data we present


- Define data we present in an easy to understand format


## What's In Scope: 
For this first iteration, the focus will be on user authorization data specifcially for VA Leadership:
* Determine what kinds of user authorization data they find useful.
  * Why are they asking for that data?
  * What is the impact of the data?
* Display the user authorization data for VA Leadership
  * Ensure that there is a common language: that everybody has the same definition of what X is.
  * Industry standards surrounding reporting & displaying user data.
  * We keep the data display as simple as possible.
    * Nothing extraneous -- or secondary -- that we might use to monitor performance ourselves, but could easily be misunderstood.
  * We have easily-understood explanation for what each data point is, and why it's important.

## Out of Scope: (for this iteration)
* Data not specifically for VA Leadership

## Use Cases:
| User          | Problem       | Solution  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| VA Leadership | I want to understand data how Veterans access VA.gov | This dashboard  |

(We'll build out the use cases on a more specific level after we do the research on what kind of data VA leadership is looking for.)

## Assumptions:
* There are common pieces of user authorization data that VA Leadership is continually wanting to view.

## Solution Approach: 
* Do research to determine what kind of
* Determine what's useful.
* Build out the data
* What are the user data requirements?
* Probably datadog, maybe public-facing.
