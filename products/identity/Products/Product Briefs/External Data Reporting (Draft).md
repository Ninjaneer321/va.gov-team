# External Data Reporting (Draft)

## Overview: 
Understand what kind of data our users want, who they are
Display and explain the data in a user-friendly way

## Problem Statement: 
The data produced by the Identity Team is often not instantly understandable and can be misrepresented or misinterpreted.

Understand what people find useful, our audience is, what data is important to each audience.

Define what the data is, get them closest to what they're looking for.

Simple sets of user data -- agreed-to by the entire team, tell our story, properly


## Relevant Documents:  (Joe's notes)
- Settle on definitions for data
- Understand the reasons why teams/people want the data they are asking for
- What are the user data requirements of each audience
- We need a single set of definitions around the data we present
- Industry standards surrounding reporting & displaying user data
- Why are they reporting user data they are, what is the impact of the data
- Define data we present in an easy to understand  format
