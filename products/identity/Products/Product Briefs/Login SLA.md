# VA.gov SLA

## Overview: 
Publishing the Service Level Agreement targets we want to hit for Veterans logging into VA.gov. with the ultimate goal of continuously improving the login process to VA.gov. This maps to _O1KR2: VA.gov authentication SLOs are developed.__

We have two audiences for this information:
* Veterans logging into va.gov
* Other va.gov product teams.

This is a follow-up to the Login SLO project.

## Problem Statement: 
We do not currently have any current SLAs for VA.gov logins, and publishing them them will help us monitor and improve the Veteran login experience.

## Relevant Documents:
* [Login SLO Product Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Products/Product%20Briefs/Login%20SLO.md)
* [Public Facing SLO Dashboard](https://app.ddog-gov.com/sb/f327ad72-c02a-11ec-a50a-da7ad0900007-df6fa7bc92140323ffecbf4e10b16346?refresh_mode=sliding&from_ts=1710016052679&to_ts=1712608052679&live=true)
* [Branding Exercise](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q3WnJY-0fJ3HcuYNptZnAbJaWUGK3FGCkvH19AJYFJo/edit#slide=id.g2c630c18cda_1_141)

## What's In Scope: 

* Service Level Agreements
  * How we will publish the agreements to other teams.
    * Perhaps just posting a single SLO doc used by all teams in Github (rather than doing it per team)?
  * How we will publish the agreements to Veterans



## Out of Scope: (for this iteration)
* Incident Response
* Accountability in SLOs - who gets assigned & their impact toward total numbers
* Automation
  *  Notify when investigations are happening.
  *  Slack notifications when SLOs reach a certain level.


## Use Cases:
- As a Veteran or VA Team member, I would like to see high-level data visualizations related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so that I am provided with immediate, comprehensive information about the status of services that I am using. 
- As a Veteran or VA Team member, I would like to see service level agreements related to the status and performance of authentication services on VA.gov, so I can understand what to expect from those services.
- As an ID team member, I would like to have a plan on who gets assigned and when they get assigned to fix SLO issues.
- As an ID Team member, I would like to have automatic notifications when investigations are happening
- As an ID Team member,  I would like to have slack notifications when service degradation occurs.


## Assumptions:



## Solution Approach: 



  
## Technical Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| VA Policy |  Is there VA policy surrounding availability & response times?     |
| Industry Standards |  Are there industry standards surrounding availability & response times?     |

## UX/ Design Considerations:
| Issue         | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Language when publishing the SLOs |   Would like UX help in crafting the publishing language          |


## Measuring Success:
| KPI           | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| 75% of the endpoints are covered w/ SLO|  Published in tabular form             |
| How are we meeting the SLO are published on a monthly basis |  Will be assigneed to Delivery Manager    |


## Baseline KPI Values:
| KPI           | Notes         | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  |               |


## Milestones:



## Future Scope:
* Determining our response to observed service degradation.
* As the Identity Team adds new products and takes on new responsibilities, it is anticipated that new SLOs will need to be established and published.
