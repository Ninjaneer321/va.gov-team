# Metrics

## Monthly Metrics

## Overview: 
Publish a set of monthly metrics surrounding our support of other teams in accordance with O4KR2: _Establish and publish monthly metrics around response times for VA.gov product teams._  

While many of the metrics will be more of an informational nature, there is one this is incredibly important: our Customer Satisfaction score. This will be gathered using a survey to be deployed in #vsf-identity slack channel, our github page, at least.  This survey will be the key part of fulfilling O4KR3: _Establish and maintain a support satisfaction rating of 70% or greater for VA.gov product team support_.


## Problem Statement: 
As the Identity Team becomes more of a platform team, we want to have more visibility into how we actually support other teams, as well as transparency as to how those other teams view our support.  Thus, publishing Monthly Metrics.
