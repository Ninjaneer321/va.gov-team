# Request & Support Process Critical Path

In which we explain each step along the way when a user submits a request to the VA Identity Team

## 1. Slackbot Invoked By User
Someone (lets call them the Requestor) goes into the #VSP-Identity Slack channel page and invokes our slackbot. (Exactly how this happens is still TBD.)

## 2. Initial Bot Response
Based upon the language used and/or the nature of the query, the Slackbot responds to the initial response.  (What this will be is also TBD, But an example might be to point the user to something previously published that addresses their issue.) The bot also displays a form for the user to fill out.

## 3. Did Initial Response Solve Problem?
The Requestor evaluates the initial response, and makes a decision as to whether or not the Slackbot's initial response is sufficient to solve their prolbem. 

- If so, the matter never gets opened. 
- If not, they fill out the provided form.

## 4. Requestor Fills out Form
At this point, the Requestor fills out the form provided by the Slackbot

## 5.
