# 3 Types of Metrics Products

In 2024, we are deploying three disparate products in order to track and socialize metrics associated with the Identity Team.  This document aims to explain the differences between these products.

## Support Metrics
Support Metrics are how we are measuring our responses to support requests from other VA.gov teams.

Dashboards that display the following metrics:
  * Counting Metrics
    * Tickets Opened
    * Tickets Closed
    * Tickets by Current Status
    * Tickets Requests by Team
    * Ticket Requests by Product
  * Satisfaction Metrics
    * Survey Score
      * We have an OKR dedicated to keeping this above 70%

## SLO Login Metrics
SLO is an acronym for Service Level Objectives, which are related to monitoring how well our various endpoints working: the goals is that Veterans are able to swiftly login and see their information.  The initial SLOs are:

  * Availibility
    * Logging in
    * Seeing information
    * Logging out
  * Response Time
    * How fast are things loading?
