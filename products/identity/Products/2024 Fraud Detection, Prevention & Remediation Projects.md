## 2024 Fraud Prevention, Detection & Remediation Projects

Each one of these projects ties to our overall Objective to mitigate digital identity fraud .

Online scams and their sophistication have increased dramatically in the last few years, resulting in account takeovers, stolen PII/PHI, and payment redirection. With more Veterans receiving benefits than ever before, and the need to access and manage them online, Veterans are a prime target.

We're tackling it from three angles:
- Fraud Prevention: trying to prevent it from happening in the first place.
- Fraud Detection: when it happens, discovering it swiftly
- Fraud Remediation: ensuring that we help them recover their accounts as swiftly as possible.
