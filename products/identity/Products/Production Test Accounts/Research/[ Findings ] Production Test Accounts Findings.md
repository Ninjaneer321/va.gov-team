## Key Findings

### Production Test Account Usage

#### Current Practices
- The product teams we spoke to leverage production test accounts to validate features in a production environment after releases.  Most teams state that they use lower environments to perform preliminary tests but since these environments are not connected to all services throughout the VA ecosystem (and Oracle), it is challenging to simulate real-world interactions like secure messaging and pharmacy functionality.
- *[Types of testing conducted in production]* smoke testing, regression testing, usability testing, data validations, load testing

### Testing Across Environments

#### Staging Environment Usage
- *[What testing happens in staging]* Teams follow a standard practice of developing on their local machines, leveraging dev and staging environments to preliminarily test features prior to releasing.
- However, these teams report that staging differs markedly 
- *[Team preferences and workflows]*

#### Lower Environment Practices
- *[Development environment testing]*
- *[Local testing approaches]*
- *[Environment-specific challenges]*

#### Production vs. Non-Production Testing
- *[Comparison of testing activities]*
- *[Why certain testing must happen in production]*
- *[Risk mitigation strategies]*

### Workflow Patterns

#### Typical Development-to-Validation Flow
1. *[Step 1 in typical workflow]*
2. *[Step 2 in typical workflow]*
3. *[Continue mapping the flow]*

#### Team Coordination
- *[How teams coordinate testing activities]*
- *[Communication patterns]*
- *[Handoff processes]*

#### Variations Across Teams
- *[How workflows differ between teams]*
- *[Team-specific adaptations]*
- *[Factors influencing workflow choices]*

**Status:** [Confirmed/Partially Confirmed/Not Confirmed]  
**Evidence:** *[Supporting or contradicting evidence]*

### Hypothesis 2: Environment inconsistencies create workflow friction
**Status:** [Confirmed/Partially Confirmed/Not Confirmed]  
**Evidence:** *[Supporting or contradicting evidence]*

### Hypothesis 3: Testing workflows vary significantly across teams
**Status:** [Confirmed/Partially Confirmed/Not Confirmed]  
**Evidence:** *[Supporting or contradicting evidence]*

### Hypothesis 4: Current processes create confidence gaps
**Status:** [Confirmed/Partially Confirmed/Not Confirmed]  
**Evidence:** *[Supporting or contradicting evidence]*
