# External Auth Status Pages

## Overview
Create and maintain an external-facing status page for users of VA.gov

## Problem Statement
There is currently inadequate external-facing status pages for VA.gov authentication services. This lack of transparency can lead to confusion and frustration for VA.gov users when issues arise. An external-facing status page would help mitigate these problems by providing real-time updates on the status of these services, leading to clearer communication and better overall service.
