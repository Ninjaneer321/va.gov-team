## Analyzing Data

## Q1 *Rate your satisfaction with the support provided by our team.*

Purpose: 

- This question serves as the foundation for measuring client satisfaction. It provides an overall view of how well our team is meeting user expectations.

Analysis:

- Calculate the CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) Score:

    - Your customer satisfaction score is a CX metric used to understand how satisfied a customer is with a business experience or specific interaction.

    - - Assign numerical values to the response options (e.g., Very Satisfied = 5, Satisfied = 4, Neither Satisfied Nor Dissatisfied = 3, Dissatisfied = 2, Very Dissatisfied = 1).
    
    - Take the number of satisfied customers (those who rated us a 4 or 5), and divide by the total number of answers. For example, if 62 of your 100 responses have a rating of 4 or 5, your score would be 62.

Graphing Ideas:

Create a bar chart showing the distribution of responses.

Highlight the percentage of Very Satisfied and Satisfied responses.

## Q2: Add a comment about the quality of service you received.

Purpose: 

This open-ended question allows users to provide specific feedback. It captures qualitative insights beyond numerical ratings.

Analysis:

Categorize comments into themes (e.g., responsiveness, knowledge, friendliness).
Identify recurring issues or positive aspects.
Use sentiment analysis tools to gauge overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
Graphing Ideas:

Word cloud: Visualize frequently mentioned words.
Sentiment analysis chart: Show the balance of positive and negative sentiments.

Question 3: If you answered anything other than Very Satisfied, what could our team do to make your experience one that warrants a Very Satisfied response?
Purpose: This question helps uncover areas for improvement. It encourages users to suggest actionable changes.

Analysis:

Group responses into categories (e.g., process improvement, faster resolution times, better communication).
Prioritize based on frequency and impact.
Graphing Ideas:

Create a Pareto chart to highlight the most common improvement areas.
Question 4: Is there any additional feedback you would like to share?
Purpose: This open-ended question allows users to express additional thoughts or concerns.

Analysis:

Similar to Question 2, categorize feedback and identify patterns.
Look for insights that may not fit neatly into other questions.
Graphing Ideas:

No specific graphs, but consider including verbatim quotes in your report.
Possible Topics:
Your overall experience: Assess the holistic experience beyond support interactions.
The product you used with our team: Understand how product functionality impacts satisfaction.
Our troubleshooting guide: Evaluate the effectiveness of self-help resources.
The Identity Slackbot: Gather feedback on specific tools or channels.
Question 5: If we may contact you to learn more about your experience, please enter your email here. (Optional)
Purpose: This question allows users to volunteer for follow-up discussions.

Analysis:

Collect email addresses for further investigation.
Use this information to reach out to users with specific issues.
Graphing Ideas:

No specific graphs, but track the number of users willing to be contacted.
