# Research Plan for VEText Team, MyHealtheVet email appointment reminders content Veteran feedback, 01/2024

## Background
VEText is a platform for sending SMS messages to Veterans. These messages can be either one way or interactive. It was developed to lower no-show rates for Veterans’ health appointments by a team at the VA Loma Linda Healthcare system and rolled out nationally in 2018.

VEText will begin additionally sending the email appointment reminders for MyHealtheVet, as MyHealtheVet migrates to VA.gov. We would like to evaluate the content, cadence or functionality of those email appointment reminders by asking Veterans for feedback. This feedback will determine if changes should be made to the content, cadence or functionality in order to improve Veterans’ experience using email health appointment reminders.

### 2024 OCTO Priorities 

#### Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

- Key Result 2: Number of transactions processed using our products have increased by 25%.

- Key Result 3: All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.


#### Objective 2: Our platforms are the best way to deliver products at VA.

- Key Result 2: Our platforms measure and improve the satisfaction of their internal users.

- Key Result 3: Our platforms power twice as many interactions compared to last year.

[2024 OCTO Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md)


### Veteran Journey
This fits into the Veteran journey at: Taking care of Myself

Full [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for reference.


## Research Goals	
- What content do Veterans want/expect in email health appointment reminders?

- What schedule is most effective for receiving appointment reminders?

- If email reminders are not useful currently, what could make them useful?


### Outcome
This research will allow us to gauge Veteran satisfaction with current email appointment reminders. Additionally, we may learn what can improve and then make content, functionality or cadence changes accordingly.

   This will:

  - Increase recipient satisfaction

  - Decrease oversaturation of reminders

  - Improve care by getting Veterans to their appointments, prepared with necessary information

### Research questions

1. Overall do Veterans find value in email appointment reminders? Why or why not?
2. Is there a way to make the content or cadence of email appointment reminders more useful?
  

### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that Veterans want more information in their emails including details about the location and provider for their health appointments and that Veterans currently do not find the MHV email reminders as useful as the appointment list within the MHV portal, which includes more detailed appointment information.


## Methodology	
1\. Our methodology will be a remote moderated interview of Veterans where we will discuss with Veterans what information they want in email reminders for health appointments and what they would expect to be included.

2\. After discussing what they would expect, we will show them an example of the existing MHV email reminder and ask them to share their thoughts on the content and cadence as well as how they currently use MHV email reminders.


### Location
Remote, Zoom

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

### Prepare
The experience is currently live

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: chris.horton@oddball.io
* Date and time of pilot session: 01/07/25

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:01/13-22/2025

### Length of sessions
Session length: 40 minutes
Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
Maximum Sessions per day: 2


### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled?

01/14/2025 12-3:30pm ET

01/15/2025 12-3:30pm ET

01/17/2025 12-3:30pm ET

01/20/2025 12-3:30pm ET

01/22/2025 12-3:30pm ET

01/23/2025 12-3:30PM ET

01/24/2025 12-3:30PM ET

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
**Please do not include email addresses in this section.** We previously required email addresses. VA's GitHub policy ([see announcement](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/discussions/13)) has changed. VA.gov email addresses cannot be in public repositories.

**Please list the names of people in each role.** In the Slack study channel, send an email and primary phone number for the moderator. Send emails only for the notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker.
