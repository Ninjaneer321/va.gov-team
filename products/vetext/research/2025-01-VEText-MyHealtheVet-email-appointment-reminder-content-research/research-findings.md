## Research Goals
- What content do Veterans want/expect in email health appointment reminders?

- What schedule is most effective for receiving appointment reminders?

- If email reminders are not useful currently, what could make them useful?


### Outcome
This research will allow us to gauge Veteran satisfaction with current email appointment reminders. Additionally, we may learn what can improve and then make content, functionality or cadence changes accordingly.

   This will:

  - Increase recipient satisfaction

  - Decrease oversaturation of reminders

  - Improve care by getting Veterans to their appointments, prepared with necessary information


## Research Questions

1. Overall do Veterans find value in email appointment reminders? Why or why not?
2. Is there a way to make the content or cadence of email appointment reminders more useful?


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

* **H1:** Veterans want more information in MHV emails inclucing provider and location: **True**
    * *"I've gone to appointments where I don't know who I am going to see and I don't like that." -P6*
    * *"If it could say 4 North, which would be on the 4th floor on the North, that information would save time for me*
    * *"Where do you go? If you really want to show up there on time, that really helps"*  -P1
    * *"I can go down my appointment list right now and just look at the information and the date and I can tell you who it's with*" -P8
* **H2**: Veterans currently do not find the MHV email reminders as useful as the appointment list within the MHV portal: **Likely false**
    * Veterans are using emails (and texts) as confirmation and/or reference to more complete information that they have already recorded in their personal calendars or that some check in VA.gov app. Reminders are secondary to the more complete information they record at the time the appointment is made. More detailed information about the appointments (not contained in email reminder)comes from other sources (see below)
    * *"Typically what I'll do is go in and bounce that against my calendar, make sure there is not any inconsistencies" -P1*
    * *"I double check what they are saying and what I have because a lot of times, they have been wrong." -P6*
* Veterans get detailed information:
    * at the time of appointment/confirmation email
    * By making assumptions of who they are seeing and for what specialty based on prior knowledge of the location name
    * Calling the facilities, which can take a long time or cause frustration when a call goes to the general (not clinic-specific) number
    * Consulting the VA.gov app appointment information
    * Using mailed appointment postcards, which may not arrive on time/inconsistent


## Methodology	
1\. Our methodology will be a remote moderated interview of Veterans where we will discuss with Veterans what information they want in email reminders for health appointments and what they would expect to be included.

2\. After discussing what they would expect, we will show them an example of the existing MHV email reminder and ask them to share their thoughts on the content and cadence as well as how they currently use MHV email reminders.


## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)_

1. Veterans want provider (8/11 participants), direct clinic numbers and a more precise location information (7/11 participants) in MHV emails
2. Email reminders work well as reference and backup to confirming details recorded in Veterans’ personal calendars
3. Lack of detailed information in reminders forces Veterans to be detectives, make assumptions and create their own workarounds to determine appointment details
4. Appointment reminders need to be concise and without “filler” information
5. Veterans are generally comfortable about PHI information being contained in their email and the usefulness of the additional information outweighs privacy concerns
6. Veterans would like self-tailored control over how and what information they receive in reminders
7. “Notification Preferences” section was mostly understood to be where Veterans can select the kind and amount of reminders they receive, but where this information is contained within current email is often skimmed, skipped or overlooked as superfluous “filler” 
8. Getting to an appointment on time is a way of respecting fellow Veterans and content in reminders play a role in facilitating that
9. Format of emails, font size and contrast, has a significant impact on usability
10. Changes in MHV emails format should be communicated to Veterans in advance of release and across multiple channels


## Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible. Please **add relevant keywords/labels to your findings** selected from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc). Adding keywords/labels to your findings will help others find research relevant to their work.

## Additional Insights

_Any additional insights that aren't "key findings." These can be powerful comments from users that don’t represent a pattern in this study, but may be part of one outside this study._


## Recommendations

_Put together initial recommendations here based on your findings along with supporting evidence. Review with your team, then edit as needed._

1. Include provider, direct clinic numbers for scheduling and address including floor/building information
2. Approve PHI version of email and offer it asap.
3. Move forward with a more VADS formatted email that includes headings, highlighted appointment information and consider ways to consolidate/link out some of the non-appointment detail information such as how to prepare or change an appointment.
4. Email formatting should be designed with sharability in mind (copy/paste, screen shots, link to share)
5. Create a section for parking details for each facility
6. Hyperlink a hospital map within the appointment information address for navigation
7. Selecting communication preferences for all formats of reminders within VA Profile should clearly explain the result of each selection and be easily findable within the portal. Some Veterans may associate selection of VEText and/or MHV email reminders as “paperless” and conclude those selections opt them out of mailed reminders. I.E. if a Veteran selects that they want only email and text reminders, it should not be assumed
8. that they also want paper reminders. The option to receive or not receive paper reminders should be an option. Finally, if reminder cadences are standard, consider adding how many reminders a Veteran can expect from each format (i.e. Emails are sent 7 days and 1 day prior to appointments)
9. PHI needs to be explicitly explained as to what additional information will be contained
10. Continue sending MHV reminders as a list of all upcoming appointments, however consider moving cadence to 7 days and 1 day prior; consider alternatives for frequent re-occurring appointments
