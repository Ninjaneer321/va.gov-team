# Research Plan for Rainbows, Post-911 GI Bill Benefits Wizard, 10/08/2018

## Goals
#### 1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
Post-911 GI Bill Benefits page, on the Rainbows team
#### 2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?
The Post-911 GI Bill Benefits page provides a digital statement of benefits that veterans can use to confirm their benefits (if they have applied and received benefits more than 60 days prior) and get more information about how much they’ve used and how much benefit is remaining.
#### 3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
* Can Veterans find this troubleshooting wizard when they need help?
* Does a troubleshooting wizard help Veterans get the information they need?

#### 4. Hypothesis:
A wizard-like troubleshooting feature on the GI Benefits page will help Veterans experiencing errors to understand what went wrong and what their next steps are for solving the problem. Veterans will feel confident about their next steps and help desk calls related to this page will be reduced.

## Method
#### 1.	What method of research are you planning? 
A first click test using Chalkmark on Optimal Sort. The test will be remote and unmoderated.

#### 2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
I'd like to test whether users are able to identify this new feature through the call-to-action and whether the responses they receive after troubleshooting are helpful and easy to identify.

#### 3.	Where are you planning to do your research?
Through a Chalkmalk first click test: https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/chalkmark/gibswizard-0

#### 4.	What will you be testing?
Full visual design prototyped screens of a wizard-like interaction

## Participants and Recruitment
#### 1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)
Looking for 10-20 participants in a range of ages (20s-80s) who are aware of VA education benefits.

#### 2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
I will need help with recruiting for this.

## When? 
#### 1.	Timeline: When are you hoping this research will happen?
Planning to run a preliminary click test as soon as possible after WBC launch on 11/7.

#### 2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin)
The prototype I will test will be completed by Monday 10/30/18.

#### 3.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times. Please request enough dates and time slots. Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.
Not applicable for this unmoderated test.

#### 4.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? (Ideally this should not be someone on your team). 
I have asked for review and feedback with my team, Rainbows, as well as the larger design and content team.


## Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role.
- Moderator: Katelyn Caillouet
