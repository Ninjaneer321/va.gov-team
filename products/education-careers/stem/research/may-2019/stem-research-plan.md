# Sprint Research Plan #
## STEM Scholarship Application Form ##
May 1, 2019 – June 7, 2019

#### Problem Statement 
As a Veteran who has completely depleted my Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits, or is within 6 months of doing so, and 
*	needs extra time to complete my science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) undergraduate degree, or 
*	needs extra time to complete my teaching certification after earning an undergraduate STEM degree, 

I want to apply for an Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship as easily as possible.  
 

#### Solution Hypothesis
By presenting the scholarship application questions in an easy to use interview format, pre-populating Veteran data when available, presenting contextual help and guiding the Veteran through the process of completing the form, VA.gov will simplify the process of applying for STEM Scholarship benefits. 

The online application will improve the experience of applying for education benefits. In addition to saving the Veteran time and increasing their satisfaction with the process, the online application process will allow Veterans to feel more confident in their ability to apply for benefits independently.

#### Research Questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:
 
* What challenges or common pitfalls might Veterans face when attempting to complete the STEM scholarship application?
*	What information does the VA need to receive from Veterans to ensure that valid scholarship requests are approved?
*	Where can we use conditional logic and branching to display only those questions that are relevant to the Veteran?
*	Are there opportunities to streamline the form by pre-populating data from other sources?
*	What information and/or contextual help would be helpful on the form to ensure that valid requests are approved?
*	Do users have questions around why they are being asked for a fiscal year, rather than an academic year
* Do users wonder whether they need to enter the number of credits they’ve completed as of today or as of the end of the current quarter/semester?


#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?

The reseach process will be deemed a success once we understand the users' goals, needs and behaviors, and are aware of issues they may encounter when completing the STEM form. This knowledge will allow us to craft content and user interactions that will enable users to provide all necessary data to ensure that eligible Veterans are granted the STEM Scholarship. 

#### What kinds of users do we need to talk to answer our questions?

The following users have been identified:
*	Veterans, Spouses and Dependents
* School Certifying Officals
*	VA Education Stakeholders


#### What specific questions do we need to ask on our Usability Testing screener to get the right kinds of users to test the form?

In addition to the standard questions, which ensure a representative mix of participants, the screener should include the following questions and responses:

1.  Are you currently or have you in the past used VA Post 9/11 GI Bill educational benefits? 
    * If yes, to Question 2
    * If no, thank caller, end
2.  Are you pursuing (or did you obtain) an undergraduate degree in science, technology, engineering, or math? 
    * If pursuing, schedule participant (or continue to Question 3 if it's not too limiting)
    * If graduated,to Question 4
    * If no, thank caller, end
3.  Are you nearing the end of your GI Bill benefits? (If this questions it too limiting, it can be omitted.)
    * If yes, schedule particpant
    * If no, to Question 4   
4. Are you interested in pursuing a teaching certification (in any discipline) now that you've earned your undergraduate degree? 
    * If yes, schedule participant
    * If no, thank caller, end
    

#### What kind of user research do we want to conduct?

The following research methods will be used:

Bi-weekly Requirements Sessions 
* VA Education Stakeholders

Structured Discovery Interview:
*	4 School Certifying Officals
* 2 Users (Veterans, dependents or spouses)

Remote Moderated Usability Testing of a High-fidelity Prototype:
*	2 School Certifying Officals (Booz Allen will recruit)
* 6 Users (Ideally, 4 Veterans, 1 Spouse, 1 Dependent)


#### What testing and recording tools do we need to run the research sessions?

Remote Interviews will be recorded via WebEx

Usability test sessions will be recorded via WebEx

In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer. 

#### What artifacts do we need to support the research effort?

For the Discovery interviews, the following artifacts will be developed:
*	Discovery Questionnaire

The questionnaire will be ready by: May 3rd

For the Usability Testing, the following artifacts will be developed:
*	A high-fidelity, clickable InVision prototype
*	Veteran Test Script

The InVision prototype will be ready by: May 17

The Test scripts will be ready by: Date May 17


#### Who will fill the team roles?
* Screener writers: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox
* Recruiter: Perigean Recruiting Firm
* Conversation guide writer: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox
* Prototype Designer: Cindy Cruz
* Moderator: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox
* Note-taker: Theresa McMurdo, Amy Knox and Cindy Cruz
* Observers: UX Team
* Research readout writer: Theresa McMurdo or Amy Knox

#### When do we want to conduct the testing?
Phase 1: Discovery Interviews  
*	Interviews will be conducted May 6th - 8th 
*	Interview timeslots will be: 9AM, 11AM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM 
*	Each session will last no longer than 45 minutes
*	A debrief among team members will be held immediately after each session.
*	The findings will be synthesized once all sessions have occurred and a findings report will be made.

Phase 2: Usability Testing of the Prototype 
*	Usability Testing will be conducted - May 20th - 23rd
*	Usability Testing timeslots will be: 9AM, 11AM, 1PM, 3PM, 5PM
*	Each session will last no longer than 45 minutes
*	A debrief among team members will be held immediately after each session.
*	The findings from usability testing will be synthesized once all sessions have occurred and a findings report will be made.

#### When do we need to start recruiting?

Phase 1 SCO and User Interview Recruiting needs to be complete by: Monday, May 6th (Booz Allen Hamilton)
Phase 2 Usability Testing Recruiting needs to be complete by: Friday, May 17th
