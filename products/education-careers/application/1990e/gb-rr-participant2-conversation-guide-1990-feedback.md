# Education Benefits Application Research with Veterans

## Participant 2 (2pm ET) - 1990e only

### Main questions

- Can you tell me a little about yourself? **VA since 2011; Gulf War veteran; 3 yrs active duty; 5-6 years; 80% service-connected disabilities; works as network eng for telecom company**

- Could you tell me about what VA education benefits you have used? **none**

- Please imagine that you are trying to sign up for education benefits transferred to you by a spouse or parent.

  1. What parts of the process seemed confusing or required extra work?
      * Hard to know exact dates, since thinking back 30 years
      * Felt like school selection was redundant; why doing similar things on 2 different pages; wondering if he filled out the previous page wrong, so now has to go back and fix
  2.  If you could wave a magic wand and improve three things in the application process, what would they be? What would the magically improved version be like?
      * Clearer explanation/examples about what the school selection tuition assistance question means


#### Raw notes (1990e)

  * Applicant information: may want to indicate that it must be a 4-digit year
  * Sponsor veteran: nothing confusing
  * Education history: paused to figure out: would prefer 2 separate questions, e.g. "post-high school trainings" seems to refer to the field, e.g. electrical engineering, while "Name of college" is the actual institution.
  * School selection:
    * Looks like it's asking again (for second time) for his college history (i.e., looks similar to the education history on first glance); would like more information about what this page is about, e.g. synopsis about what you're asking, e.g., "transfer of credits from point A to point B"
    * Tuition assistance question seems "convoluted"; he has not received this, so doesn't understand the question. Some examples would be helpful, e.g. "Pell grant." Examples could help people know whether it does or doesn't apply to them
    * Career goals: examples make it straight-forward
    * Contact information: would like all-of-the-above instead of radio
    *
