# Open Questions for Future Teams

1. **Signature & Certification**
   - The current staging experience uses a **privacy policy checkbox** as the attestation mechanism.
   - The paper form includes a **signature and alternative signer section** (e.g., parent, guardian, custodian).
   - It’s unclear:
     - Whether the checkbox is legally sufficient
     - Whether a formal signature is required digitally
     - Who is expected to sign in dependent scenarios
     - Whether one or multiple signatures are required

2. **Sponsor Education Status**
   - The paper form includes education status questions for both the applicant and the sponsor.
   - In the digital flow, it’s unclear:
     - Whether sponsor education status is required for eligibility or processing
     - Or whether it exists solely for parity with the paper form
   - Clarification is needed on whether this question provides meaningful value or can be omitted.

3. **Active Duty Status & Military History Requirements**
   - The flow distinguishes between **active duty** and **non–active duty** service.
   - It’s unclear:
     - Why this distinction is required
     - What downstream impact it has on eligibility or processing
   - The paper form captures **full military history**, but the current digital experience does not.
   - Open questions include:
     - Whether full service history is required or only the most recent period
     - Whether any portion of military history can or should be pre-filled

4. **Use of Intro / Grounding Pages**
   - Grounding pages are typically used to introduce **list-and-loop patterns**.
   - In the proposed flow, a grounding page exists for **Sponsor Military History**, but not for other sections.
   - It’s unclear:
     - Whether intro/grounding pages should be used consistently across sections
     - Or only where list-and-loop patterns are present
   - Alignment is needed to ensure the experience feels intentional and consistent.
