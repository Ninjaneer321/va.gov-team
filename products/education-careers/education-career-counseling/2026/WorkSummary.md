# Summary of All Work Completed on Chapter 36

### Project Overview
Chapter 36 supports veterans, service members, and eligible dependents seeking **educational and career counseling and planning resources**. The work focused on understanding the **current paper and online experiences**, identifying misalignment, and exploring improved digital flows that balance **usability, compliance, and parity**.

### Work Completed

#### 1. [Intake & Context Establishment](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/education-careers/education-career-counseling/project-plan.md)
- Received Chapter 36 documentation and project plan
- Learned that Chapter 36 is one of **many VA forms** that must:
  - Remain consistent with one another
  - Meet accessibility requirements
  - Align with VA Design System v3
- Established that paper and online versions are not currently in sync

---

#### 2. [Paper Form Analysis (VA Form 27-8832)](https://www.va.gov/forms/27-8832/)
- Reviewed the full paper form
- Documented:
  - Benefit overview and eligibility requirements
  - Veteran/service member information
  - Claimant (spouse/child) information
  - Military history requirements
  - Remarks section
  - Certification and signature requirements
- Treated the paper form as a functional baseline, even where digital translation is unclear

---

#### 3. [Current Online Experience Audit (Staging)](https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/education-and-career-counseling/apply-career-guidance-form-25-8832/introduction)
- Walked the end-to-end existing online flow on staging
- Documented:
  - Entry point and navigation
  - Applicant information flow
  - Dependent (spouse/child) path
  - Sponsor data collection
  - Review and submission behavior
- Identified key characteristics:
  - Partial prefill exists but is inconsistently applied
  - Online flow is **significantly shorter** than the paper form
  - Military history and certification are reduced or implicit
  - Submission relies on privacy policy acknowledgment rather than explicit signature

---

#### 4. [Review of Prior (Unshipped) 2024 Proposed Flow](https://www.figma.com/design/DEnVQXRrNvwJ3UkKkYYJ1Q/Ch-36-PCPG-2024-Updates?node-id=159-23845&t=4MSVac5P2eiD3J3P-1)
- Reviewed a previous proposed flow intended to better align with the paper form
- Noted improvements:
  - Clearer structure
  - Explicit military service periods
  - Confirmation email and post-submit feedback
- Confirmed the effort was **never implemented**

---

#### 5. [New Simplified Flow Proposal](https://www.figma.com/design/LSXC1hAiV02EbdfhFBHwIz/Chap.-36-2026?node-id=132-47592&t=KRB1j4ad4aF4kuyY-1)
- Designed a streamlined alternative informed by:
  - Current live experience
  - 2024 proposal
  - VA “simple forms” strategy
- Key contributions:
  - Simplified entry page
  - Clear applicant-type decision upfront
  - Unified structure across applicant types
  - Reduced page fragmentation
  - Conditional logic instead of extra steps
  - Repeatable military service period pattern
- Explicitly documented open questions instead of making assumptions
