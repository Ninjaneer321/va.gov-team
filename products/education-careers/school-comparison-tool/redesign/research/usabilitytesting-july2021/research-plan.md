# Research Plan for GIBCT Profile Page
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
 - Booz Allen research for Education Service/OIT
 
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The Booz Allen team has been working on a re-design of the GI Bill Comparison Tool. The content and layout of the school profile pages was redone and new navigational functionality was added. The team would like to see how users interact with the new profile page and how it fits into the new overall design of the GI Bill Comparison Tool.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

Navigation:
- Do users notice the jump links on the right hand side?
- Do users utilize the jump links?
- How do users navigate the profile page (e.g. scrolling, jump links, Back to top button)?

Content:
- What value (if any) do users see in the school profile pages?
- Do users have any questions about the information they see on the profile pages?
- Is there any additional information users want to see on the school profile pages?
- Do users notice the specialized mission in the card headers on the profile page?

Functionality:
- Do users try to compare schools from the profile page?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	
- Researchers believe that users will be able to successfully navigate and find important information on the redesigned school profile pages. We believe the updated design will fit well with the redesigned search and compare components which have already been tested.
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
   - Remote moderated usability testing will allow us to observe how users interact with the school profile pages. We will be able to see what the user looks at, clicks on and how they expect the functionality to work. It also allows researchers to ask questions about what the user is thinking as they are perusing the page to gain better insight into their thoughts, actions and expectations.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research?	
 - Online using Zoom

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
- We will be testing the design, content and flow of the school profile pages.

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
- Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
- Recruit 12 participants
- All participants will need to access the session from a laptop or computer

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
- July 21-23rd, 2021
 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	

- July 19th, 2021


3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 

- 45 minutes


4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?
