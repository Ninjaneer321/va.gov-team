# Research Plan for Comparison Tool Redesign for Users
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
 - Booz Allen research for Education Services / OIT
 
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

Many changes and improvements have been made to the Comparison Tool over the past few years.  EDU would like to gain a better understanding of all the different users that utilize the Comparison Tool and their respective needs.  From this research, EDU hopes to fully redesign the Comparison Tool to better meet the needs of its users.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	
 
- What did the education journey look like for participants?
	 - How did participants discover/search for schools?
  - How/what criteria did they use to select a school?
		
  - Did they use the Comparison Tool?
		    	
       a. If yes, how and when during their education journey?
         1) What does the tool do best?
			      2) What are the biggest challenges with the tool?
			      3) Is there any additional information or functionality they would like to see on the tool?
          
	   b. If no, had they heard about it prior to starting their journey?
- What would have made the education journey easier?
- How and where do participants get help for questions on education benefits?
- What are the unique needs of non-Veteran users?
- From a user’s perspective, what would be the ideal Comparison Tool?

 
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 

Researchers believe that the design of the Comparison Tool can be optimized by identifying the users of the tool and redesigning the tool to meet their associated needs.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote, moderated directed interviews 	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
  - Researchers need to obtain a full understanding of how the Comparison Tool is used by a variety of users and what their unique needs are. Researchers need to be able to ask follow-up questions and dig deeper into users' answers to gain insights into their needs. 
  
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
  - Online
4.	What will you be testing? 
  - Researchers will be determining the functionality, features and content that should be housed on the Comparison Tool.
  
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)
  - Zoom
  
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  

- 11-16 participants
  - 5-8 Veterans 
     - 3-5 Veterans who are personally using Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits
     - 2-3 Veterans who are personally using non-Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits
     - All Veterans should meet one of the following:
       - Have personally started using their GI Bill benefits in the last 6 months
       - Be currently using their GI Bill benefit
       - Plan to personally use their GI Bill benefit in the next 2-3 months
  - 3-4 dependents (non-Veteran beneficiaries)
    - Dependents should meet one of the following:
      - Have started using their GI Bill benefits in the last 6 months
      - Be currently using their GI Bill benefit
      - Plan to use their GI Bill benefit in the next 2-3 months
  - 3-4 School Certifying Officials (SCOs)
     
Age Range: 24-54

Gender: Mix

Geography: Geographically dispersed across US

Technology: Access to a computer, preferably running Google Chrome browser

Familiarity with technology: Any

Login requirements: None

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
 - Recruiting for Veterans and Dependents will be performed by Perigean Technologies
 - Recruiting for SCOs will be performed by the Booz Allen team through existing connections.

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
  - Oct 15 - 27, 2020 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? 
  - By COB Oct 9th
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 
  - 45 minutes
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? 
 - Thurs, Oct 15th:  9:15-10AM; 10:30-11:15AM;
 - Fri, Oct 16th:  10:30-11:15AM; 12-12:45PM; 1:15-2PM;

 - Wed, Oct 21st:  10:30-11:15AM; 12-12:45PM;
 
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 
 - TBD
