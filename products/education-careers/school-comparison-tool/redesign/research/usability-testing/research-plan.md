# Research Plan for CT Redesign - Search, Compare and Initial Profile Page
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
  - Booz Allen research for Education Service / OIT
  
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

 - The Booz Allen team conducted extensive research with Comparison Tool users and stakeholders to identify their needs and challenges when researching schools to attend. This research resulted in recommendations that focused on optimizing search functionality, incorporating information and functionality that facilitate school selection, and encouraging prospective students to take the next step in their education journey.  From these recommendations, initial designs for the search, comparison and school profile pages were created and now need to be tested to validate their effectiveness.
  
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	
 
 Search
 - How do users expect the different searches to work / be executed?
    - Location search
    - Degree / program search
 - What challenges do users have (if any) with the new search interface?
 - Do users believe their search results were relevant based on their inquiries?
 - How do users expect search results to be organized/sorted?
 - From the user's perspective, which filters are valuable?
 - From the user's perspective, which filters are not valuable?
 - Do users understand how benefits numbers are calculated?
     - Do users notice Military Details?
     - Do users think this dropdown is important to the calcuation of benefits?
 
 Compare
 - How does the proposed select-to-compare functionality work for users?
 - How do users expect to navigate to and from the Compare page?
 - Are users satisified with comparing 3 schools on desktop?  Only comparing two schools on mobile?
 - What do users think of the layout of the Compare page?
    - Can users easily find the information they want to see?
    - How easy is it for users to compare/contrast information?
 - What information do users want to compare between schools?
    - What information is critical, nice-to-have or not important?
 
 Profile Page:
 - Do users recognize the jumplinks as navigation tools?
 - Do users interact with the jumplinks?
 - What sections of the profile page appear to be most important to users?
 
 
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 

- Researchers believe that users will be able to effectively search for schools using the new design.  Additionally, we believe that users will be able to easily find and utilize the comparison functionality and be successful at using the new navigation options on the school profile pages.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing with high-fidelity prototypes 	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
  - Remote moderated usability testing will allow us to assess a user's ability to complete basic, but critical functionality on the tool that has been redesigned.  We will be able to see what the user looks at, clicks on and how they expect the functionality to work.  It also allows researchers to ask questions about what the user is thinking as they are completing the tasks to gain better insight into their thoughts, actions and expectations.
3.	Where are you planning to do your research?
 - Online using Zoom 	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 
 - We will be testing the design, content and flow of the prototype
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use	
 - Zoom
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria:	  
 - Recruit 10-12 participants
 
     - 4 participants will be tested on mobile phone devices (iPhone only)
     - The remaining 6-8 participants will be tested on desktop
     
 _Note to Perigean:  We would like to schedule mobile users in the final two days of testing_


**Primary criteria / Must have** 

- Participants should either:
     - Have started attending school in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021
     - Be looking to start school in 2021
     
 - VA Benefit requirement:
     - 75% of participants personally using or planning to use Chapter 33 Post-9/11 benefits 
     - 25% of participants personally using or planning to use education benefits other than Chapter 33 Post-9/11 benefits

**Secondary criteria / Would like to have** 
- Age range: 18-55
- Gender: Mix
- Geography: Geographically dispersed across US

    
Note:  We cannot support the usage of screen readers for this testing effort.
