GIBCT needs to be updated to display campus-specific BAH estimates to comply with this legislation."

# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Evaluate user understanding of how to engage with the BAH calculator tool"
  - goal_2: "Identify challenges users face when viewing and comparing BAH amounts for multiple locations"
  - goal_3: "Assess the effectiveness of UI elements and geographic inputs in the BAH calculator"

research_questions:
  - "Do users understand how to engage with the tool to see estimated BAH amounts?"
  - "What challenges or common pitfalls do users face when attempting to view and compare BAH amounts for multiple locations?"
  - "Which aspects of the UI, if any, hinder the user's ability to identify a location they'd like to attend?"
  - "Which aspects of the BAH calculator's geographic input cause confusion, if any?"
  - "What additional information or contextual help would ensure users can leverage the tool's full capabilities?"
  - "What aspects of the presentation of the BAH estimate could be improved to enhance user understanding?"

hypotheses:
  - "By providing campus-specific housing rate estimates, Veterans and GI Bill beneficiaries will understand the housing allowance value they'll receive while attending different institutes"
  - "Knowing the approximate housing allowance amount will reduce Veterans' financial concerns and allow them to feel more confident in making informed education decisions"

expected_outcomes: "Validate the BAH calculator design and identify improvements to help Veterans make informed education decisions based on campus-specific housing allowance estimates"

# Research Plan for EDU, GIBCT Sec 107, July 9-10, 2019

## Goals
#### 1. Product & team

For the Education team, we plan to conduct usability testing on the GI Bill Comparison Tool.

#### 2. Background

The GI Bill Comparaison Tool (GIBCT) allows GI Bill beneficiaries to learn about education programs and compare benefits by school. Section 107 of the Colmery Act requires VA to calculate Post-9/11 GI Bill monthly housing allowance (MHA) based on the location of the campus where the individual physically attends a majority of classes, rather than the location of the institution of higher learning at which the individual is enrolled. This project involves updating the GIBCT to be in compliance with Sec 107 of the Colmery Act.  

#### 3. Research questions 

The research is designed to answer the following questions:
 
*	Do users understand how to engage with the tool to see estimated BAH amounts?
*	What challenges or common pitfalls do users face when attempting to view and compare BAH amounts for multiple locations?
*	Which aspects of the UI, if any, hinder the user's ability to identify a location they’d like to attend?
*	Which aspects of the BAH calculator’s geographic input cause confusion, if any?
*	What additional information or contextual help would ensure that users are able to leverage the tool’s full capabilities?
*	What aspects of the presentation of the BAH estimate could be improved to enhance user understanding?


#### 4. Hypothesis
By providing the ability to view campus-specific housing rate estimates, the GI Bill Comparison Tool on VA.gov will allow Veterans and other GI Bill beneficiaries to understand the value of the housing allowance benefit they'll receive while attending various institutes of higher learning. Knowing the approximate housing allowance amount will reduce Veteran's financial concerns and allow them to feel more confident in their ability to make an informed decision about their education options.


## Method
#### 1.	What method of research are you planning? 

Remote Moderated Usability Testing of a high-fidelity prototype.

#### 2.	Why this method?  

Remote Moderated Usability Testing of the high-fidelity prototype will allow us to observe how participants interact with the site, hear their thought process and ask probing questions to better understand their goals and the actions.

#### 3.	Where are you planning to do your research?  

Usability test sessions will be recorded via WebEx. In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer.

#### 4.	What will you be testing?

Particpants will be granted control to interact with a clickable InVision prototype running on the moderater's laptop.
