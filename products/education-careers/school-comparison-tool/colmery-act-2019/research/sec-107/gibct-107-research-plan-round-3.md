background:
  problem_statement: "Section 107 of the Colmery Act requires VA to calculate Post-9/11 GI Bill monthly housing allowance (MHA) based on the location of the campus where the individual physically attends a majority of classes, rather than the location of the institution. The GIBCT needs to be updated to comply with this requirement."

# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Evaluate users' ability to engage with the tool to find estimated BAH amounts based on calculator selections"
  - goal_2: "Test users' ability to find and use housing allowance controls for different school types and locations"
  - goal_3: "Identify refinements needed to improve users' ability to find and use housing allowance controls"

research_questions:
  - "Are users able to engage with the tool to find estimated BAH amounts that take into account the user's calculator selections?"
  - "Are users able to find and use the relevant calculator controls to modify the estimated housing amounts for an extension of the currently selected schools?"
  - "Are users able to find and use controls for a new IHL location that has not yet been added to the GIBCT?"
  - "Are users able to find and use controls for a new location for OJT or an apprenticeship?"
  - "What refinements, if any, are needed to improve users' ability to find and use the housing allowance controls?"

hypotheses:
  - "By increasing the visibility of the 107 control and campus-specific housing rate estimates, the GIBCT will allow Veterans and other GI Bill beneficiaries to more accurately estimate the housing allowance benefit they'll receive"
  - "Knowing an approximate housing allowance will help Veterans feel more confident in their ability to make an informed decision about their education options"

expected_outcomes: "Validate the Section 107 housing allowance design and identify any needed refinements to improve usability and accuracy of benefit estimates for Veterans making education decisions"

# Research Plan for EDU, GIBCT Sec 107, Round 3 August 14-16, 2019

## Goals
#### 1. Product & team

For the Education team, we plan to conduct usability testing on the GI Bill Comparison Tool.

#### 2. Background

The GI Bill Comparison Tool (GIBCT) allows GI Bill beneficiaries to learn about education programs and compare benefits by school. Section 107 of the Colmery Act requires VA to calculate Post-9/11 GI Bill monthly housing allowance (MHA) based on the location of the campus where the individual physically attends a majority of classes, rather than the location of the institution of higher learning at which the individual is enrolled. This project involves updating the GIBCT to be in compliance with Sec 107 of the Colmery Act.

#### 3. Research questions

The research is designed to answer the following questions:
* Are users able to engage with the tool to find estimated BAH amounts that take into account the user’s calculator selections?
* Are users able to find and use the relevant calculator controls to modify the estimated housing amounts for:
  * an extension of the currently selected schools (includes public, private, flight, foreign, and for-profit school)
  * a new IHL location that has not yet been added to the GIBCT
  * a new location for OJT or an apprenticeship
* What refinements, if any, are needed to improve users’ ability to find and use the housing allowance controls?

#### 4. Hypothesis

By increasing the visibility of the 107 control and, as a result, the campus-specific housing rate estimates, the GI Bill Comparison Tool on VA.gov will allow Veterans and other GI Bill beneficiaries to more accurately estimate the housing allowance benefit they'll receive while attending education and training institutions.  

Knowing an approximate housing allowance will help Veterans feel more confident in their ability to make an informed decision about their education options.

## Method

#### 1. What method of research are you planning?
Remote Moderated Usability Testing on a demo / staging version of the GI Bill Comparison Tool (GIBCT).

##### 2. Why this method?
Remote Moderated Usability Testing in a demo area will give us a more accurate view on how participants engage with the GIBCT, hear their thought process and ask probing questions to better understand their goals and the actions. 

#### 3. Where are you planning to do your research?
Usability test sessions will be recorded via WebEx or Go-To-Meeting. In-person notes will be taken by hand and/or on a computer.

#### 4. What will you be testing?
Participants will be granted control to interact with the demo GIBCT running on a virtual machine.
