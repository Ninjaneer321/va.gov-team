- [Appendix](#user-content-appendix)

## Research Goals

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Veteran’s journey?  
- What outcomes are we aiming to achieve for Veterans and stakeholders?  

## Research Questions

1. What feedback do family members have on individual questions?
2. What feedback do family members have on the entire form flow? (Total number of questions, order questions appear, the amount of information needed)
3. Do family members understand what supporting documents are needed for their specific claim scenario?

## Methodology 

We used remote, moderated usability testing to observe research participants using a staging prototype on desktop and mobile devices.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Surviving spouses and children will understand questions with minimal clarification.
    - **Definitely False**  
    - Participants often found the questions provided insufficient detail for them to answer confidently. 

2. Family members won't find the number and content of the questions to be overly burdensome.
    - **Likely False”**  
    - Participants would express frustration and try skipping questions or said they would have given up and made an appointment with the VA to complete the form. 

3. Family members will understand what supporting documents are needed to support their claim.
    - **Likely True**
    - Participants seemed to understand and appreciate the “Follow these steps to get started” on the application cover page; they also liked being able to save the application and come back when they have the requested information.  

4. The supporting documents list at the end of the form was a useful reference that helped people complete the form. 
    - **Partly True**
    - Participants liked having the list there, but said it would have been easier if the list of documents and the place to upload them was on one page. Spread across two pages, they had to jump back and forth. 

## Key Findings

1. 7 out of 9 participants and two pilot participants struggled with the logic and found the workflow hard to follow, especially in the Household information / Marriage section.

2. 5 out of 9 participants and one pilot participant reacted negatively to the way the form uses language about death and family relationships

3. For 3 of 9 participants and one pilot participant, audience ambiguity was a significant problem.

4. 3 of 9 participants and one pilot participant felt like having to figure out what benefits they are entitled to places an unnecessary burden on them at a stressful time.

## Details of Findings 

#### 1. Participants struggled with the logic and found the workflow hard to follow, especially in the Household information / Marriage section. 
- 6 of 9 participants and two pilot participants had problems understanding questions and/or the order in which they were asked.
  - Many had questions about why specific information is required, for example: 
    - Why the VA needs to know about claimant previous marriages / spouses names
    - Why the land lot size of owned property was requested in the assets section.
  - Participants had questions that required additional context and simpler language.
    - Participants asked for clarification for terms like “claimant” and living “continuously” with the veteran.

> “What if your veteran was deployed? What if he was in a nursing home?” - P6
> “It's important for the form to be clear and concise, especially if it's a sudden passing.” - P3  

#### 2. Participants reacted negatively to language about death and family relationships. 
- Some participants considered equating death with the end of marriage to be disrespectful, with one person characterizing it as “very cold” and another, “my marriage didn’t end when he died.” 
- They had similar sentiments about the requirement to describe the Veteran’s previous marriages, about which some had little information. 

> Encountering the question "How did marriage end?" the participant said it feels like “it's too much.” Given that they were already asked about their marriage status, they said "I wish there was a way to ask this less.” - Pilot 1

#### 3. Audience ambiguity, especially in the financial section, was a significant problem.
- At some points,  participants expressed frustration when addressed as “you”; they weren’t sure if they were being addressed as the beneficiary or the caregiver of a beneficiary. 
- Some participants said it seemed like the role of the person completing the form was  changed in the course of the workflow. 
- Some users started the form by putting in their own name and information instead of Veteran's, then would have to backtrack. 

> “Do you have a care expense? Is that for the veteran or for the claimant?” - P3

> “And the [assets accordion tab], do you and your dependent have 25k in assets? Again, who is the “you”? The beginning part of the form was straightforward and made me feel like I was the surviving dependent, but towards the middle and end it was confusing as to who was doing what and the roles changed. [scrolls down] This doesn't make any sense at all. Who's the you??? Who is this you? (frustration). Is it a custodian? A caregiver? What? There's a lot of different roles there. I would get lost, I wouldn't know how to fill it out.” - P5

> “Does selecting ‘spouse’ mean they were married or divorced? Maybe they could select ‘ex-spouse’ or ‘current spouse’. The start of the marriage section was confusing at first. - Pilot 1

> “But what if I was filling out for a child under 18? Whose role am I filling out? Confusing.” - P6

#### 4. Participants said they assume the VA already has enough information to tell them what they are eligible for and not the other way around.
- They feel like having to figure out what benefits they are entitled to places an unnecessary burden on them at a stressful time.

> “Why don’t they have 1 button, then you fill it out, and then they tell you what you are eligible [for] instead of having to fill out multiple? Just have one form, then they tell you what you are eligible for. Why make it so hard on the surviving spouse?” - P6

> “The hoops and time it takes is frustrating. They expect that you know what the VA does and has. I don’t work there; I am just the spouse, and it’s a crap shoot. Half the people who do it probably don’t know that they could apply or could be eligible. They don’t do that. I am nosy and have a lot of military people, so I dug. When your spouse dies, you won't think of it, but there goes half the income, and you are trying to figure it out.” - P6

> “I could either cancel adding the VA medical center or finish the application later, but they are the VA, they should know this. The records they keep are incredible. They keep notes about everything, even about when you call in, what you said, and the manner in which it was said, or what happened during the VA visit. They should have all of this.“ - P6

## Accessibility-Related Issues

- Move focus to H3s instead of step headers
- The DIC acronym is pronounced as a word, not the acronym
- Screen reader repeats headings
- Fields formatted for numbers should display an error message when words are typed in
- Date fields were not in typical MM/DD/YYYY format, resulting in errors

## Additional Insights
- Many of the responses are required, however, this can become a roadblock if the response the person needs is not permitted. 
- Data entry patterns were not in expected and helpful formats, specifically: 
  - Date fields were not in typical MM/DD/YYYY format, resulting in errors. 
  - Users were expected to recall the name of the VA facility(ies) that treated the Veteran.
    - There are dropdown lists for Location and Facility on VA forms such as the [10-10EZ](https://www.va.gov/forms/10-10ez/). 
  - Currency fields did not have comma separators.
  - The list of documents the user needs to upload was on a separate page from the upload location. Participants had to go back and forth.
- Where the user is prompted to review entries (e.g., dependent information, expense information), all caps can be interpreted as yelling:
  - DELETE

## Recommendations

1. Consider revising the text for the marriage end/death of veteran question
    - Because participants were put off and even insulted by this question, revise the text so that it does not equate death with the end of a marriage. 
2. Consider revising the workflow in the marriage section.
    - Participants completing the form who were married to the veteran when they died  said they wanted to skip the question, “How did the marriage end?” 
3. People did not understand some of the questions clearly, and said they wanted to know the reasons for those questions.
    - They said that they were concerned about 
      - Why the information was relevant, and 
      - The implications of their answers on their benefits. 
4. Consider fewer required questions and/or adding an “I don’t know” option to the responses.
5. Consider displaying the list of documents and the upload function on the same page at the end of the form.
    - Users found it awkward to have to flip back and forth, write down, print, or otherwise remember what documents they need.  
6. Format fields to be consistent with user expectations.
    - Users expected two-digit fields for the Day and Month (i.e., use “01” for January),
      - Note this was also an issue for vision-impaired participants. 
    - One subject said they would like to see comma separators for currency fields. 
    - Consider a dropdown/location finder for VA medical centers, as found on other VA forms. 
7. Update the confirmation to reflect digital submission.
    - The current confirmation, “Your submission is in progress. It can take up to 30 days for us to receive your form” gives an impression of inefficiency and long wait times. Consider revising the text to reassure them their submission was received.
