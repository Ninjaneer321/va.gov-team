# 05-2024_527EZ VSR Shadowing Research 

Allexe Law-Flood (Allexe.Law-Flood@adhocteam.us)


## Background

VA.gov aims to offer digital experiences that are the best way to access VA health care and benefits. In 2023, VA Office of the CTO engaged a team to manage and improve digital claims for pension benefits. In the fall of 2023, the web-based version of VA Form 21P-527EZ was found to be several versions behind the paper form. The digital Veterans Pension form was deactivated from VA.gov in November 2023, in order to reduce Veteran burden of having to re-apply. It was relaunched in January 2024 and a usability study of the form was completed shortly after relaunch. 

As we continue looking at oppportunities to holistically improve the Pension service design,  this discovery research was conducted to better understand the back of stage.  We sought to understand how the data in the Pension application is used by Veteran Service Representatives (VSRs) and to identify information challenges that may cause delays, further claim development, and/or unnecessary denials.  The information from these sessions will inform a [map that outlines the steps VSRs take in processing a 527EZ application](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1708629678413/23448c79bc4bdd9e0651c7cdce459a57715a8066?sender=u7ebb3c5845122387949f4600).  

**Research Questions**
* How might we build on our understanding of the VSR experience of processing Veterans Pension claims?
* How might we identify the biggest pain points and opportunities for process improvements for VSRs when it comes to processing Veterans Pension claims submitted on VA.gov and understand the challenges faced by Veterans?  
* How might we understand what information is still essential on the form, what could be simplified, and what is superfluous or unnecessary due to changes in the process?


## Methodology

This research relied primarily on “shadowing,” a technique in which researchers observe VSRs work through actual claims. The VSRs follow their normal process, narrating what they are thinking and doing as they work through a claim. Researchers ask occasional questions but are mostly silent observers. This shadowing technique provides high-quality information about processes and products. 

Over a week, researchers shadowed 3 senior VSRs working on a 527EZ application. We conducted one shadowing session with each VSR, observing the processing activities for 3 claims. The sessions were conducted remotely and lasted 60 minutes. 

The VSRs that we spoke to had over 10 years of experience processing different applications and claims. Two of the VSRs were still working with pension, one was doing pension applications and maintenance work, the other maintenance work. The third VSR had 14 years of experience processing applications but had not processed a 527EZ in over a year.  We did not speak with any VSRs new to processing 527EZ applications.


## Top Level Summary 

Overall VSRs noted that the 527EZ is complicated and that it is difficult for Veterans who meet the eligibility requirements of 527EZ to complete on their own without there being a need to send out a development letter, especially elderly Veterans who aren’t used to dealing with government forms.  One VSR noted that the 527EZ is very daunting especially if you have difficulty seeing or remembering.  It was noted by the VSRs that when a Veteran is completing a 527EZ application on their own, there will generally be a need for a VSR to send a development letter requesting additional information. 

VSRs receive the pension benefit applications as PDFs no matter whether they are submitted as a paper version or via the web-based form. The information on the PDFs are compared to what is in VBMS Share, CAPRI and the Social Security Administration database. 

VSRs try to determine factors that will lead to qualification or disqualification by looking at a few key pieces of information on the application such as whether the Veteran signed the application; the percentage of their disability compensation/ service connection (e.g. a high percentage of  90-100%  would likely disqualify them), the availability of military service dates and service number, whether a social security number and date of birth has been provided, whether the Veteran listed an income and the size of the income.

From the perspective of one of the VSRs, most Veterans are not eligible for the 527EZ pension benefit unless they are requesting a special monthly pension (SMP) because the medical expenses offset the income.  It was also noted that anyone under 65 years applying would likely be seeking a SMP because their age would not qualify them for pension but medical expenses related to their disability (or disabilities) and a low income might qualify them.  

Another VSR we spoke to identified some challenges Veterans have with the paper PDF form that result in applications being returned or the need for a development letter to be sent to the Veteran, which delays eligibility decisions. Examples include not providing any information in section 9H about income which results in their application being returned as incomplete; providing unclear or incomplete information about marital status, or not providing supplemental forms such as VA Form 21P-0969, Income and Asset Statement in Support of Claim for Pension or Parents' Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) income or VA Form 21-0779, Request for Nursing Home Information in Connection with Claim for Aid and Attendance.

Lastly, it was noted that Veterans are frequently entering ineligible expenses for recurring medical expenses or are not entering eligible recurring medical expenses from the date of their Intent to File (ITF). This can result in a significant loss of compensation for Veterans, as they may be missing out on being reimbursed for months worth of expenses.

## Key Findings 

1. Veterans are losing time and money when they don’t understand what information is needed on the pension benefit application, and why 
2. Some Veterans struggle with  remembering exact dates for marriages and service 
3. VSRs begin reviewing 527EZ applications looking for key pieces of information

### 1) Veterans are losing time and money

Veterans do not always understand what information is required, why information is needed, and the time frame they should use for entering expenses on the 527EZ.  

#### a. Unreimbursed Medical Expenses
Veterans are losing out on several months of monthly medical expenses that could be reimbursed. Veterans may have a lag time of 6-9 months from time they started their pension application to the time they complete it.  <br />
Under “Date Costs Paid” for unreimbursed recurring expenses, Veterans are using the date that they are entering the information.  They are not dating their medical expenses back to the date of the ITF. As a result, they are losing out on several months of monthly medical expenses that could be reimbursed.

> **_Team/Product questions_**<br />
> _How might we help Veterans understand that they are entitled to benefits as of the date of their ITF (entitlement date, not earlier)?   (ITF language TBD)_

#### b. Some Veterans choose not to complete sections of the form 
Sections that ask for information that a Veteran assume the VA already knows about them are often left incomplete. 

Examples include income, especially federal income from civil service pay or social security and medical history if they receive treatment from a VA facility. 

> **_Team/Product questions_**<br />
> * _How might we provide clarity of what information is required, why and how it is used?_<br />
> * _How might we gain access to the information that the VA has to streamline the experience by pre-populating information?_

#### c. Claims submitted without a representative typically require a lot of development compared to those submitted with the help of a VSO, Attorney or Claims Agent. 

This is especially true if supplemental forms, such as 0969 and 8416, are needed. 

> **_Enablement Team/VBA questions_**<br />
> * _How might we help Veterans avoid delays in receiving pension benefits ?_<br />
> * _How might we reduce the cognitive load of completing the 527EZ application?_<br />
> * _Should Veterans be encouraged to get assistance from a VSO?_

#### d. The current paper version of the 527EZ has sections which regularly cause confusion for Veterans 

Those sections are : 
1. The need to report an income 
2. Current marriage status
3. VA Form 21-0779, Request for Nursing Home Information in Connection with Claim for Aid and Attendance.   It was noted that the Veteran may have difficulty identifying the right person at a facility to complete the 21-0779 form. 

As a result of 1-3 above, **development letters need to be sent** requesting additional information which delays award decisions. 

Note: The online web-based form has addressed 1 and 2 above as well as concerns that all Veterans were being asked if they are medically incapable of working vs just applicants under 65. (See _ADDITIONAL DETAILS below for more information)_


> **_Enablement Team/VBA questions_**<br />
> _How might we address the challenges Veterans are experiencing with the  paper and online PDF version of the pension benefit application?_

### 2) Some Veterans struggle with retrieving exact dates  
The 527EZ form asks for month/day/year for marriages, divorces, military service and separation, **yet VSRs are often able to process their 527EZ applications with month and year.**

Two out of 3 VSRs shadowed indicated that month and year are sufficient for marriage and divorce dates when processing the pension benefit application. 

One VSR noted that  it’s ultimately the VAs responsibility to get the Veteran’s records and service dates, but if there is no information available through the DD214, they would return the application as incomplete. They also noted for pension all that’s needed is a wartime period

> **_Enablement Team/VBA questions_**<br />
> * _How might we reduce the burden for Veterans in remembering exact dates (e.g. marriages, divorces, military service)?_
> * _How might we keep dates to the minimum information needed?_

### 3) VSRs begin the review of pension benefit applications looking for key pieces of information


#### a. VSRs are initially looking at a few key areas
These areas determine if they proceed with an application, send a development letter, or deny a claim. 

The sections include:
* Accurate signature (Veteran or Power of Attorney, if they have a 21-22 on file)
* High service connection (90-100%) compensation
* Military service and military service number
* At least one source of income is listed (and/or if income is over the limit)
* D.O.B. and SSN (allows them to pull a Social Security Administration query)
* The right type of compensation is checked on the paper PDF (e.g. pension benefit vs claims comp)

They also look at the following information which can indicate whether an application will require further development (more or less review time).
* Age (under 65)
* Over 25,000 in assets
* If seeking Special Monthly Pension (SMP)

#### b. Applicant information 
The following are estimates by the VSRs based on their experience processing pension benefit applications
* Up to 75% are using accredited representatives
* 60%+ are in facilities(e.g. assisted living), 10% in nursing homes
* Over 50-75% of applicants are seeking SMP 

> **_Team/Product questions_**<br />
> _How might the findings above influence the development of the web-based pension benefits form?_


### Additional Details for Key Finding #1D

These findings relate to the current paper version of the 527EZ.  The digital version has addressed most of these challenges. These findings will be shared with the appropriate VA team. 

**PDF generated from paper pension benefits form** has sections that are not clear. One VSR who has been processing pension benefit applications for years noted that Veterans are regularly not fully completing the applications or erroneously entering information, identifying the following areas on the paper PDF form to be challenging. 

#### 1) Income and Assets (paper form)

In the Income and Assets Section lX 9G of the paper form, Veterans answer “no” to having MORE than 4 sources of income and then skip over questions 9H(1) thru 9K(3) which are for reporting any income they receive. <br />
Note section states _“If you leave the entire question blank, we will assume you have no income to report”_  yet “_If any items or skipped or left blank will be considered an unspecified income and could require a request for further information, potentially delaying your claim.”_<br />
Pension rules say that at least one entry in the income section of the form is required; if no statement is received regarding income,  the claim is supposed to be returned as incomplete.<br/>
The instructions in this section seem to be misleading for the Veteran. **There are some people that don’t have income, but there’s nowhere for them to say that they don’t have income** (instead the question on the paper form just asks if they have more than 4 sources of income).  

![527EZ paper form income sources section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-05%20527EZ%20VSR%20Shadowing/527EZ-paper-form-income-sources.png)


**The online pension benefit form** does not ask if they have more than 4 sources of income** It asks the following: 

* We want to know more about the gross monthly income you, your spouse, and your dependents receive.  List the sources of income for you, your spouse, and your dependents
* What type of income?
* Who receives this income
* Add another income source?

Note: They are unable to leave this section blank. 

> **_VBA/SME  questions_**<br />
> * _Is there a need to have an option of “no income”?_<br />
> * Should applicants know in advance if they have more than 4 sources of income to report that they will need to submit an 0969?   What happens if they list 4 on the 527EZ and the rest on their 0969? 

#### 2) Marital Status (paper form)
Marital status does not have a “divorced” option The options are:
* Married
* Separated
* Not-Married (widowed or never married)  

Not married could be interpreted as divorced or never married. 

Language in Section VII: Prior Marital History confuses VSRs.  
_Tell us about your and your spouse’s previous marriages. If you have never been married or your current marriage is yours and your spouse’s only marriage, skip to section Vlll_.

1. A lot of people report not married and then provide previous marital history or indicate that they are not married and skip over the other questions
2. One VSR noted that they would prefer that there is a checkbox for them to positively affirm that they haven’t been married prior to their current spouse (right now they just skip over it on paper PDF)<br />
VSR quotes:
    a. _“They have to collect information on past marriages because it's in the manual which is derived from the law.”_
    b. _“Usually month and year for marriage dates are enough”_



![527EZ paper form marital status section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-05%20527EZ%20VSR%20Shadowing/527EZ-paper-form-marital-status.png)

![527EZ paper form marital status section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-05%20527EZ%20VSR%20Shadowing/527EZ-paper-form-prior-marital-history.png)


#### 3) Medicaid question (paper form)

Pension Information Section Vlll  4D _“Does Medicaid cover all or part of your nursing home costs or have you applied for medicaid?”_   

If they select yes, they are asked to have an official from their nursing home complete VA Form 21-0779, Request for Nursing Home Information in Connection with Claim for Aid and Attendance.  **Often applicants using the PDF form are not providing this additional information and it becomes a development request**.    

The online pension form breaks up these questions:

* Does Medicaid cover all or part of your nursing home costs? (*Required)
* Have you applied for Medicaid? (*Required)
    * If they respond yes, they receive the alert _“You'll need to submit a Request for Nursing Home Information in Connection with Claim for Aid and Attendance (VA Form 21-0779). An official from your nursing home must complete the form.”_

#### 4) Medical Condition that Prevents (paper form) 
Paper form: Section IV Pension Information 4B  _“Are you medically incapable of working?”_   

Online form: _“Do you have a medical condition that prevents you from working?”_  The only time that this question should be asked is if the Veteran is under 65 years of age.  

Online, this is a conditional question that only appears if you indicate that you are under 65.  

!["527EZ paper pension form Section IV Pension Information section"](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/research/2024-05%20527EZ%20VSR%20Shadowing/527EZ-paper-form-age-health-smp.png)



### Next Steps: 

1. Identify ITF related design improvements being made to the 527EZ form and how/whether some of the ITF language changes may be applied to the unreimbursed expenses section of the form so Veterans are aware that they can back-date expenses to their ITF date.
2. Speak with VBA SMEs to determine if : 
    * no income should be an option for Veterans to select in the Income and Assets Section lX 9G and share the challenge identified with this section when using the paper version of the 527EZ. 
    * Veterans list more than 4 sources of income on the 527EZ and do not use the  0969, does it create challenges for the VSR processing the information and/or the Veteran? 
    * Section Vlll  4D _“Does Medicaid cover all or part of your nursing home costs or have you applied for medicaid?”_   which has a yes or no response causes a challenge if the Veteran has applied for medicaid but it does not cover all or part of nursing home costs? 
    * Identify if there is a backlog of improvements to the paper version of the 527EZ form for which relevant findings from this research should be included.
3. Triangulate findings with other data (eg. Veteran research, analytics, desk research) to help support 527 and team prioritization and drive decisions.
4. Update the [Map of Steps VSRs take to process 527EZ applications ](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1708629678413/23448c79bc4bdd9e0651c7cdce459a57715a8066?sender=u7ebb3c5845122387949f4600)with insights from shadowing.
