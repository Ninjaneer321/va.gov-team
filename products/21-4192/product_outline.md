## Overview
This project's objective is to allow Veterans and their most recent employer to provide employment information as part of applying for Individual Unemployability disability benefits.

## Problem Statement
Veterans submit VA Form 21-4192 as part of a claim of Total Disability based on Individual Unemployability (TDIU) benefits. The Veteran completes the first portion of the form providing their own information and then sends it to their most recent former employer to gather details about the Veteran's employment, such as the dates worked, reasons for leaving, and any difficulties encountered due to service-connected disabilities.

How might we provide a way for both Veterans and their most recent employer to submit information in support of an Individual Unemployability disability benefit claim?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans and their most recent employer can submit the 21-4192

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans and their most recent employer will prefer submitting the paper form. 


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Employees at the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) are able to process requests quicker

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- There is an increased time in processing requests

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Solution Approach

- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
