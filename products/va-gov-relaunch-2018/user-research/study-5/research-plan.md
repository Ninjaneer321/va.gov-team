# Study 5 - Preview.va.gov Usability Test
## Goal
Assess the usability of the preview.va.gov on desktop and mobile. Validate our IA strategy.
 
### Research Questions
- What do current MHV Veterans think of preview.va.gov? 
- Can they find what they need using the HP, Nav, and Hubs? 
- How does preview perform on desktop and mobile?
- NOTE: We are not testing the sign-in / create account flow or any authenticated pages

## Format
In-person. Two stations - mobile and desktop
- PC with mouse and GTM screen recording, test audio 
- VA iPhone with ipevo camera connected to a mac laptop

## Recruiting
We connceted with Susan Haidary (MHV Coordnitors Lead) who gave us the POCs for the Minneapolis location:
- Carson, Lara <Lara.Carson@va.gov>; RN, MHV coordinator Minneapolis, MN
- Bosard, Leo <Leo.Bosard@va.gov> / 612 368 4540; Connected Health Coordinator (primary POC for on-site coordination)
- Carlin, Janice M <Janice.Carlin@va.gov> VISN 23 MHV Coordinator

Lara or one of her coworkers will set us up on-site to meet with Veterans.

## Participants
Current MHV enrolled Veterans

## Timeline
- Plan and build study: August 20-22
- On-site Testing: August 27-28
- Analysis: August 29-31

## Method
Homepage, Navigation, and Hubs for Health Care and Disabilty will be ready.

See Conversation Guide

### Things to Watch For - All
- We are concerned about the density of the HP, are they seeing all the links?
- What do users think of "View All" in the mega menu?
- Reactions to the HP blue ribbon with faces
- Does VCL pop-out, do they understand it?
- General use of the term VA as an adjective like "VA Health Care"

### Things to Watch For - mobile specific
- Does the footer work on mobile?
- Does the placement of the right-rail content still make sense?
