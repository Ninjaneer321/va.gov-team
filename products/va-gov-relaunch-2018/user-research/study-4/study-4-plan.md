# Study 4 - Navigation Tree Test
## Goal
Find out if our consolidated, Veterans-first navigation works for a global VA navigation strategy.
 
### Research Questions
- Does our new strategy (Health and Benefits, About VA, Locations) work for Veterans?
- Are the link labels valid and intuitive?
- Will the mega menu headings provide value or distract users?
- Can other audiences (family, caregivers, VSO, etc) find what they need?
- Does the About section work as designed?

## Format
Tree Test, Remote, un-moderated

## Recruiting
Chip Harman and the MyHeatheVet mailing list are the best way to get users, but about 95% are Veterans. If we bump our rates up high enough we may be able to get good size audiences for the other groups, or maybe Chip can use some gov delivery demographic data to help sample.

Update: OIT Comms wants to also reach out to VSO folks to get buy-in on the new designs so we can use them to help recuit non-VA Veterans for testing.

It would be awesome to get hundreds of responses to this study. FOR MHV: Completeion rate estimated at 70%. Chips click through rate estimated at 8%. If we email 18k might get close to 1k responses.

## Participants
Veterans, Family, Caregivers, VSO workers, other stakeholders

## Timeline
- Plan and build study: June 4 - 15
- Recruit: Week of June 18 leave open about 4-5 days
- Analysis: June 25 - 29
