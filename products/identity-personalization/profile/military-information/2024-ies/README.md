# Product Outline Template: VA.gov Profile IES Initiative

## Overview
The VA.gov Profile IES Initiative is aimed at integrating a feature within the VA.gov profile that allows veterans to easily access and download their Individual Exposure Summary (IES). The IES is a report generated by the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER) system, and this initiative responds to a legislative mandate requiring veterans' access to their ILER data.

## Problem Statement
Veterans need a way to access and download their Individual Exposure Summary (IES) within their VA.gov profile. The challenge lies in determining the optimal location for this feature, particularly as the IES has different types of data including military history and medical history as well as exposure data.

**How might we seamlessly integrate the IES download feature into the VA.gov profile, particularly within the Military Info section, ensuring it meets veterans' needs and expectations while enhancing their overall experience?**

## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans can easily locate and download their IES from a section in their VA.gov profile.
- Veterans feel confident using the IES in related applications, such as benefits claims (e.g., 526EZ application) and disability rating appeals.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans struggle to find the IES download link within the Military Info section.
- Increased support requests due to difficulties in finding or understanding the IES feature.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Compliance with legislative requirements to provide veterans with access to their ILER.
- A reduction in support requests by ensuring the IES is available to all veteran users.
- Increased user satisfaction and trust in VA.gov, evidenced by positive feedback and higher engagement with the IES feature and Military Info section.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Failure to comply with legislative mandates.
- Increased operational costs if the enhancements to the Military Info section and the IES feature lead to confusion or additional support needs.

## Metrics 

## Baseline KPI Values
- **Service completion:** Current metrics for similar download functionalities on VA.gov.
- **Trust/Satisfaction:** Existing user satisfaction ratings with VA.gov profile Military Info Page.
- **Health:** Current volume of support requests regarding exposure history access.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)
- **Objective:** Ensure veterans can find, download, and use their IES from their VA.gov profile.
  - **Key result:** Increase user satisfaction scores related to the military information page by 5%.

---

## Assumptions
- Veterans associate exposure-related information with their health care and may look for the IES. However, in a card sort, veterans expected the first thing the IES would contain was deployment history (see BAH card sort).
- The most significant risk is placing the IES download option in a location that veterans do not intuitively associate with exposure information, potentially leading to usability issues.

## Solution Approach
- **Initial Build:** The IES download feature will be integrated into the VA.gov profile, with placement starting in the Military Info section, where veterans typically expect to find service-related data.
- **Explicit exclusions:** The initial implementation will not include placement in the medical records section or under MyHealtheVet, as feedback suggests the IES is not solely health-related and could lead to misinterpretation.
- **Future Evolution:** Following the initial launch, user feedback and usage analytics will guide any necessary adjustments, such as considering placement in additional sections like the website (e.g., Claims sections) or incorporating the IES link into relevant benefits forms.
