# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience - Military Info, Profile - January 2023

## Background
- The product, the military information section of the VA.gov profile, currently offers the following info for those signed-in individuals for whom this info is relevant and available: military branch(es), period(s) of service, service start and end dates, contact info for addressing incorrect military info, and a link to request a DD214 "and other military records."
- We are capable of adding more information to this product, but we have unanswered questions about what users need from military info. The product is not new, but no discovery has yet been conducted to uncover answers about needs and usage of this information. 

[Research outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery)

[Product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information)

[Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/conversation-guide.md)

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following 2023 OCTO objectives:
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
The profile overall, and the military info section more specifically, are associated with a broad spectrum of Veteran needs and access to services that are relevant at any and all stages of the Veteran journey, from Starting Up to Aging. 

## Research Goals	
Determine which information would be most helpful for Veterans to have surfaced in the military information section of the VA.gov profile.

### Outcome
This research will inform the product team on what and how much military information should be populated in each Veteran's profile, and what other possible questions should be addressed in that same location, e.g. how to change incorrect service information.

### Research questions
- When and why do Veterans need access to military information?
- Which information, if any, should be added to the military information already included in this product?
- When or why might Veterans need to edit/change military information?
- When or why might Veterans need to know what military information the VA has on them?
- What info might be helpful to Veterans that are considering trying - or are working - to change their discharge status?

### Hypothesis
- Military information must be provided when Veterans apply for various VA benefits.
- Veterans receive form DD214 when they leave the service. 

## Methodology	
1. Semi-structured interviews that help us to understand what Veterans need from this product without asking them directly about the product and what they'd expect the product to show or look like.
2. At the end of the interview, there will be just 1-2 questions that will require the participant to share their screen (any device).

### Location
Remote: Zoom

### Research materials  
Link to conversation guide will go here
	
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Research participants will be Veterans recruited by Perigean.

### Recruitment criteria

**Screener question to target criteria not captured in the recruitment sign-up survey**

Questions: Which of the following have you _yourself_ completed in the past year (between January 2022 and January 2023)?
Answers (users can multi-select):
- Formally requested a correction to your military records (at least 2/12 participants must choose this answer)
