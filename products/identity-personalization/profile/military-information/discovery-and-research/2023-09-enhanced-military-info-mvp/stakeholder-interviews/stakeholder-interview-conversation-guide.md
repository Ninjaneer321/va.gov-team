# Profile enhanced military information MVP - stakeholder interview conversation guide

## Introduction
*Give brief intro of facilitor and any observers present*

[If Teams has recording capability] If it's OK with you, I'd like to record the session so I don't miss anything. Would that be alright?

_Start recording_

Can you give us an brief overview of your role and where it sits within the VA organization?

## Interview questions

### ILER

1. From my understanding, this initiative began as a response to legislation that was passed around giving Veteran’s access to their ILER.  I’m curious about the related HCD work done by the Booz Allen Hamilton team. What can you tell me about that work?
2. What was the work meant to address?
3. How did stakeholders react to the prototype they developed?
4. Why wasn’t the prototype implemented?
5. What happened after the prototype conversations?
6. I understand there is an API available to us that we can leverage to generate an PDF of a Veterans ILER. What can you tell me about that?
7. Do you have any idea if that PDF generated is accessible (508 compliant)?

### Military data points
1. There are 8 data points that have been identified to surface as an MVP for this work, and I understand they were selected because they will improve the Veteran experience of applying for benefits. Can you share me your thoughts on how surfacing these will improve the Veteran experience?
2. What do we already know about how the 8 data points identified are useful to Veterans?
3. Do we have insights into how Veterans are currently referencing this information when it's requested?
4. Which VA forms ask for the data points we’re surfacing?
5. In BAH’s research, Veterans shared that they expected information related to exposures to be available with their other VA records, especially health records. How was it decided that this belongs on the VA.gov profile, rather than the Records or Health section of VA.gov?
6. *If necessary:* The BAH research summary references Veterans expect “more information” (quote below). Is this “more information” the 8 data points we’re surfacing? 
   > There is more information Veterans expect to see within their record than is currently included in ILER, including their actual exposures and their health information after separating from service.

### Collaboration
1. Do you have any thoughts on how the integration of these data points might be useful to other VA.gov products or VA business lines?
2. Is there anyone else you think we should talk to to learn more?

### Timeline
1. Can you share any expectations you have with regard to timelines for this work?

## Closing
That’s everything I wanted to talk about with you today, thank you so much for your time. If we have more questions, would it be OK to reach back out? Do you prefer email, or Teams?
