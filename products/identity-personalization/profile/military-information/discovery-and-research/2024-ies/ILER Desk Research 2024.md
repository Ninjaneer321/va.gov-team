# Background

The goals of this document are: 
- to collect the learnings and insights to date around building Veteran access to enhanced military information in the VA.gov Profile
- to document open questions at the time of this writing
- and to offer recommendations for action, including communications around the nature of the information

## Definitions

The term **Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record** (**ILER**) has been used in two ways. It can mean:
- the ILER **information technology system** that gathers data from a range of VA and DoD systems to comprise a report about a service member’s deployments and exposure to toxins. Service members have no direct interaction with this system.
- the **report** generated from this system. Service members, epidemiologists, and providers should all be able to access this document (see below). This is used in evaluations of disability and determinations of benefits.

This is an important part of all service members’ medical history. The ILER system and report tracks a service member’s deployments, how these might expose the member to environmental hazard, and keeps a record of medical encounter information. It is also used by VA and DoD healthcare providers, and by epidemiologists and researchers. Perhaps most importantly. the report is used in evaluations of disability and determinations of benefits for individual Veterans. 

Basically, the goals of the ILER system are to track and monitor exposures, how they lead to health issues, and improve treatment for Veteran health.

ILER is jointly managed by the DoD and the VA. The DoD manages the data on ILER.
