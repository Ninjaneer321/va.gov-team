# Background

The goals of this document are: 
- to collect the learnings and insights to date around building Veteran access to enhanced military information in the VA.gov Profile
- to document open questions at the time of this writing
- and to offer recommendations for action, including communications around the nature of the information

## Definitions

**Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER)**

In the strict definition, ILER means the ILER **information technology system** that gathers data from a range of VA and DoD systems to comprise a report about a service member’s deployments and exposure to toxins. Service members have no direct interaction with this system. See the GAO report linked in Sources (PAGE NUMBER?) for details.

ILER is jointly managed by the DoD and the VA. The DoD manages the data on ILER. 

ILER was originally meant as a research tool for clinicians and epidemiologists. It was not originally meant to be accessed or used by Veterans or Service Members, but this changed due to the PACT Act. 

The generated report is an important part of all service members’ medical history. The report tracks a service member’s deployments, how these might expose the member to environmental hazard, and keeps a record of medical encounter information. It is also used by VA and DoD healthcare providers, and by epidemiologists and researchers. Perhaps most importantly. the report is used in evaluations of disability and determinations of benefits for individual Veterans. 

Basically, the goal of the ILER system is to track and monitor exposures, leading to better treatment and outcomes for Veteran health.

For an update on the roadmap and interoprability of the ILER system, please see this update (https://www.va.gov/RAC-GWVI/meetings/Feb2023/1VARAC_DoD_Exposure_Monitoring_Wearables_ILER_4Feb23_final_sjones.pdf)

**Incident Exposure Summary (IES)**

This is the **report** generated from this system. Service members, epidemiologists, and providers should all be able to access this document (see below). This is used in evaluations of disability and determinations of benefits. According to VEO stakeholders, VA owns an API that can generate a PDF/text version of a veteran’s ILER record.

Please note that when referring to the mandate to allow Veterans to "access their ILER report", this is what this refers to.

However, in most discussions and documentation, the term "ILER" is used to refer to what is technically the IES. 

Recommendation: SHOULD BE JUST USE ILER? FIND A REPLACEMENT FOR THE IES USED IN ALL THESE GITHUB PAGES?

**Enhanced Military Information**

This is a working umbrella term. It encompasses access to reports generated by ILER, any summaries of ILER data and access to it, any future ability to edit or correct information in an ILER, and the initiative to design and develop these features.

**Primary stakeholder**

The primary stakeholder on this initiative is the Veterans Experience Office (VEO).

It is not critical for our work here, but there are ~17 different stakeholder groups participating in ILER functional communities, including DHA Public Health, various VA offices, Armed Services, surgeon generals, and public health directorates (MCT ILER HCD Pre-Discovery Findings_20230215.pdf)

**PACT Act**

"The PACT Act expanded VA’s list of conditions for which veterans may be awarded disability benefits if there is documentation of deployment to an area where toxic exposure events occurred. (GAO PDF, p 2)

**Joint Longitudinal Viewer**

This is "a separate web application from ILER that provides DOD and VA staff (e.g., clinicians, claims benefits staff) a read-only display of a service member’s or veteran’s health data summarized from multiple integrated sources. Staff can also access ILER summary information through this application." (GAO PDF, p 3)

## Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter? Key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

- Taking care of my health
- Aging

## OCTO Objectives

In 2021, Congress mandated that veterans be able to view their ILER record. In 2022, as part of the PACT Act, Congress mandated that veterans be able to update this record. This desk research (and initiative) is concerned with the former.

As a result, the goal for OCTO is to design, develop, and deliver a way for Veterans to view and/or download their personal record of exposures during their service in a user-centered way. To meet this goal most effectively, the work here should focus on maximizing:
- findability
- relevance to the Veteran
- familiar context and language
- clarity on what the user should do to access/download
- clarity on what the user will access/download
- clarity on what the user can do with the access/downloaded file
- improve the readability of what we can provide (ILER reports can be very long and complicated)

This is driven by the legislative history.
Congress enacted Section 9105 on January 1, 2021, in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), to provide Veterans with read-only access to ILER.
Congress enacted Section 803 on August 10, 2022, as part of the PACT Act. Section 803(a) provides: “The Secretary of Veterans Affairs [VA] shall coordinate with the Secretary of Defense [DoD] to provide a means for Veterans to update their records as necessary to reflect exposures to occupational or environmental hazards by such member or Veteran in the [ILER].”
Section 803(b)(1) provides that to update a record under subsection (a), a Veteran shall provide such evidence as VA considers necessary. Section 803(b)(2) requires VA to promulgate a regulation defining the “evidence considered necessary.”

It is important to note that this does not specify _where_ or _by when_ should this information be made available to Veterans.

Metrics to monitor after deployment of this feature might include:
- usage metrics showing Veterans accessing this information (https://va-gov.domo.com/auth/index?redirectUrl=%2Fpage%2F1834995012%3FuserId%3D66061986)
- a reduction in time evaluating Veteran diabilities
- more efficient access to health care for Veterans in issues related to exposure
- better medical outcomes for Veterans facing issues related to exposure

## Research

The scope of this ticket is to engage in desk research to learn:
- the Congressional mandates driving this initiative to provide ILER access to Veterans
- what content from the ILER system we can reliably provide to Veterans
- how Veterans think of ILER information and how they interact with it
- what value Veterans see in the ILER information and what they do with it (what does it enable them to do)
- what has previously been discussed and workshopped with stakeholders

The goal of this ticket is to, based on the learnings above, offer:
- next steps
- recommendatons

### Hypotheses and Conclusions

For a first gloss of understanding Veterans mental models and needs for detailed information of their service, and how this relates to what tasks they need to achieve on VA.gov, we will start with existing research work (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/findings-summary.md) conducted for the Enhanced Military Information product. 

1. Veterans use ILER/IES access in relation to applying for health care
   
   **No evidence for this**
   
According to prior research for Enhanced Military Information (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/findings-summary.md), Veterans may or may not need their DD214 when applying for VA benefits and services, but having their information of service dates and deployments facilitates application for VA benefits. (Information about potential exposures and disability ratings were outside the scope of the previous research cited.)

2. Providers ask Veterans for ILER/IES information in care contexts

   **No evidence for this**

3. There is a need to format ILER data into a more readable format for Veterans
4. There is a need to learn what ILER data Veterans would need to see and how to format it

### Use Cases

According to (MCT ILER HCD Pre-Discovery Findings_20230215.pdf), the four main levels of ILER use cases are:
1) A Veteran or Service Member themselves seeking an
understanding of their own exposures,
2) Healthcare providers in a clinical setting supporting the
treatment of a Veteran or Service Member,
3) Claims agents in support of adjudication, and
4) Researchers and epidemiologists looking to identify trends and
mitigations.

**Veteran Use Cases**
"veterans will most 
often use ILER to 
certify their 
participation in a TERA 
or hazards to qualify 
for healthcare  benefits 
or compensation 
benefits under pact" -- from Mural
(toxic 
exposure 
risk 
activity )

"VEO isn't sure how 
veterans learned 
about the PDF 
access to ILER, their 
initial research 
veterans had no 
clue what it was"
