# Background

The goals of this document are: 
- to collect the learnings and insights to date around building Veteran access to enhanced military information in the VA.gov Profile
- to document open questions at the time of this writing
- and to offer recommendations for action, including communications around the nature of the information

## Definitions

**Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER)**

This term has been used in two ways. It can mean:
- the ILER **information technology system** that gathers data from a range of VA and DoD systems to comprise a report about a service member’s deployments and exposure to toxins. Service members have no direct interaction with this system.
- the **report** generated from this system. Service members, epidemiologists, and providers should all be able to access this document (see below). This is used in evaluations of disability and determinations of benefits.

This is an important part of all service members’ medical history. The ILER system and report tracks a service member’s deployments, how these might expose the member to environmental hazard, and keeps a record of medical encounter information. It is also used by VA and DoD healthcare providers, and by epidemiologists and researchers. Perhaps most importantly. the report is used in evaluations of disability and determinations of benefits for individual Veterans. 

Basically, the goals of the ILER system are to track and monitor exposures, how they lead to health issues, and improve treatment for Veteran health.

"DOD and VA released an initial version of ILER (version 1.0) for staff use in October 2019. DOD and VA have subsequently released updated versions with expanded functionalities and data sources accessible through ILER.13 For example, version 1.1 expanded the number of data sources feeding into ILER, and version 1.2 added further data sources and allowed for read-only access to individuals’ ILER exposure summaries through the Joint Longitudinal Viewer. With Version 2.3, released in July 2023, ILER included all functionalities that the agencies had initially planned, which included tools for research, according to DOD and VA officials. Following this release, DOD and VA officials said they planned to continue to make enhancements to ILER and address new legislative requirements in future versions of the web application. As of January 2024, staff were using version 2.4 (released in October 2023), which added some of DOD’s blast overpressure data. Version 2.5 will be available to staff in April 2024, according to DOD officials." (GAO PDF)

ILER is jointly managed by the DoD and the VA. The DoD manages the data on ILER.

**Incident Exposure Summary (IES)**

This is **??? A summary? A record of an individual exposure incident? NEED MORE INFORMATION**

**Enhanced Military Information**

This is a working umbrella term. It encompasses ILER (**MAYBE IES TOO?**) and access to it, any summaries of ILER data and access to it, any future ability to edit or correct information in an ILER, and the initiative to design and develop these features.

**Primary stakeholder**

The primary stakeholder on this initiative is the Veterans Experience Office (VEO).

**PACT Act**

"The PACT Act expanded VA’s list of conditions for which veterans may be awarded disability benefits if there is documentation of deployment to an area where toxic exposure events occurred. (GAO PDF, p 2)

**Joint Longitudinal Viewer**

"separate web application from ILER that provides DOD and VA staff (e.g., clinicians, claims benefits staff) a read-only display of a service member’s or veteran’s health data summarized from multiple integrated sources. Staff can also access ILER summary information through this application." (GAO PDF, p 3)

## Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter? Key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

- Taking care of my health
- Aging

## OCTO Objectives

In 2021, Congress mandated that veterans be able to view their ILER record. In 2022, as part of the PACT Act, Congress mandated that veterans be able to update this record. This desk research (and initiative) is concerned with the former.

As a result, the goal for OCTO is to design, develop, and deliver a way for Veterans to view and/or download their personal record of exposures during their service in a user-centered way. To meet this goal most effectively, the work here should focus on maximizing:
- findability
- relevance to the Veteran
- familiar context and language
- clarity on what the user should do to access/download
- clarity on what the user will access/download
- clarity on what the user can do with the access/downloaded file

Metrics to monitor after deployment of this feature might include:
- a reduction in time evaluating Veteran diabilities
- more efficient access to health care for Veterans in issues related to exposure
- better medical outcomes for Veterans facing issues related to exposure

**Legisltative background** 
Congress enacted Section 9105 on January 1, 2021, in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), to provide Veterans with read-only access to ILER.
Congress enacted Section 803 on August 10, 2022, as part of the PACT Act. Section 803(a) provides: “The Secretary of Veterans Affairs [VA] shall coordinate with the Secretary of Defense [DoD] to provide a means for Veterans to update their records as necessary to reflect exposures to occupational or environmental hazards by such member or Veteran in the [ILER].”
Section 803(b)(1) provides that to update a record under subsection (a), a Veteran shall provide such evidence as VA considers necessary. Section 803(b)(2) requires VA to promulgate a regulation defining the “evidence considered necessary.”

## Research

The scope of this ticket is to engage in desk research to learn:
- the Congressional mandates driving this initiative to provide ILER access to Veterans
- what content from the ILER system we can reliably provide to Veterans
- how Veterans think of ILER information and how they interact with it
- what value Veterans see in the ILER information and what they do with it (what does it enable them to do)
- what has previously been discussed and workshopped with stakeholders

The goal of this ticket is to, based on the learnings above, offer:
- next steps
- recommendatons


**Data and Data Quality**



**Veteran Use Cases**
"veterans will most 
often use ILER to 
certify their 
participation in a TERA 
or hazards to qualify 
for healthcare  benefits 
or compensation 
benefits under pact" -- from Mural
