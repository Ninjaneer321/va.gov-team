# Research notes for Authenticated Experience, Profile Completion, Summer 2024


## Background
The Innovate, Iterate, and Run (IIR) team has initiated work to improve the Veteran experience of getting started with VA.gov. As a branch of that work, the profile team determined profile completion is an opportunity to increase engagement with VA.gov and improve VA’s communication with Veterans. 

With this research, we want to get reactions and feedback to our initial MVP concept, which is focused on completing contact information. 

We’ll collaborate with the IIR team and join on their planned study to get this feedback at the end of the sessions they’re conducting.  If they lead the research, they could include aspects of this document, and our conversation guide suggestions to submit for research, rather than having 2 separate research plans and conversation guides.

## Research Goals	
1. We want to better understand what Veterans think about providing contact information to VA.
2. We want to learn how our MVP design impacts the Veterans experience of managing their contact information with VA.
### Outcome
We’ll use this outcomes from this research to inform design and content iterations on our profile completion flow
## Research questions
1. What is the Veteran mental model around sharing contact information with VA?
2. How do Veterans react to a guided flow that gives them specific step numbers?
3. What do Veterans expect from  “remind me later” and “finish this later” functionality?
4. Is it clear to Veterans that each piece of contact information is optional?
5. What concerns, if any, do Veterans have about being able to dismiss this workflow?
6. Is anything confusing about the workflow we’re proposing, especially considering there are other editable parts of the profile we’re not highlighting for them to complete?

## Next steps
The IIR team will coordinate with the profile team to incorporate this into the study.
