# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience Team, VA.gov Profile: Profile Hub, 05/2025

## Background üèóÔ∏è
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

The Core Veteran Experience Crew ensures Veterans and beneficiaries have a cohesive logged-in experience across and within the current mobile and web modalities. The crew seeks to do this by developing and curating a personalized view of the Veteran‚Äôs and beneficiary‚Äôs information so they can easily understand their benefits and take action to manage and update their account and benefits. We aim to aggregate and elevate personalized tasks and information relevant to Veterans on VA.gov and the Flagship Health & Benefits Mobile app so Veterans and beneficiaries can quickly get a snapshot of their existing business with VA.

`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**Authenticated Experience**
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

We are iterating on the information architecture of the VA.gov Profile Hub based on previous user feedback and analytics in order to incorporate our new feature, the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record, Individual Exposure Summary (ILER IES) report. The ILER IES report will be a downloadable PDF that informs Veterans of their toxic exposure information to inform their disability claims and health care treatments. [Implementation is being informed by prior research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2025-03-profile-secondary-research/research-findings.md#military-information)

## Research Goals ü•Ö	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` Validate if incorporating the ILER IES report into a new Letters and documents section in the VA.gov Profile matches Veterans mental models.

`2.` Validate if contents of the new Letters and documents section in the VA.gov Profile match Veterans mental models.
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**Outcome will be a validated IA for incorporating a Letters and documents section and the ILER IES report into VA.gov Profile.** 

---

### Research questions

`1.` What data points, that exist on the VA.gov Profile currently, do Veterans associate with a Letters and documents section?

`2.` Do Veterans associate the ILER IES report with Letters and documents?

### Hypotheses

---

**`1.` Based on prior research and analytics, we believe Veterans will want all letters and documents in a single section in VA.gov Profile.**

**`2.` Based on prior research, we believe Veterans will associate the ILER IES report with a Letters and documents section.** 

---
  

## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è

**`Tree test: Evaluating updates to an existing experience based on analytics and past research recommendations.`**

## Recruitment üéØ
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?*

- `ALL / Participants have a VA.gov or MyHealtheVet account`
- `16 / Very frequent VA.gov users (Daily or Weekly)`
- `16 / Frequent VA.gov users (Monthly)`
- `16 / Non frequent VA.gov users (Every few months or Never, but am open to using VA.gov)`

## Timeline üóìÔ∏è

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized?* 4/24/2025

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 

- `Pilot participant name:` **TBD**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **TBD** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **05/05 ‚Äì 05/16/2025**

### Length of sessions
- **Not applicable due to being an unmoderated study.**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time.** 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
