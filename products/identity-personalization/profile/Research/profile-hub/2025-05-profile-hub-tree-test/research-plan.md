## Background üèóÔ∏è
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

The Core Veteran Experience Crew ensures Veterans and beneficiaries have a cohesive logged-in experience across and within the current mobile and web modalities. The crew seeks to do this by developing and curating a personalized view of the Veteran‚Äôs and beneficiary‚Äôs information so they can easily understand their benefits and take action to manage and update their account and benefits. We aim to aggregate and elevate personalized tasks and information relevant to Veterans on VA.gov and the Flagship Health & Benefits Mobile app so Veterans and beneficiaries can quickly get a snapshot of their existing business with VA.

`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

**Authenticated Experience**
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

We are iterating on the information architecture of the VA.gov Profile Hub based on previous user feedback and analytics in order to incorporate new features, including the Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record, Individual Exposure Summary (ILER IES) report. The ILER IES report will be a downloadable PDF that informs Veterans of their toxic exposure information to inform their disability claims and health care treatments. [Implementation is being informed by prior research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2025-03-profile-secondary-research/research-findings.md#military-information)

## Research Goals ü•Ö	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

### Goals

`1.` Validate if incorporating the ILER IES report into a new Letters and documents section in VA.gov Profile matches Veterans mental models.

`2.` Validate if updating VA.gov Profile Hub to reflect recommendations from prior research and analytics match Veteran mental models.
  
### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

---

**Outcome will be a validated IA for incorporating new sections into VA.gov Profile Hub, including a Letters and documents section to house the downloadable ILER IES report.** 

---

### Research questions

`1.` Do Veterans associate the ILER IES report with Letters and documents?

`2.` Do recommendations to VA.gov Profile Hub, based on prior research and analytics, match Veterans mental models?

### Hypotheses

---

**`1.` Based on prior research, we believe Veterans will associate the ILER IES report with a Letters and documents section.**

**`2.` Based on prior research and analytics, we believe Veterans will want to manage all their letters and documents in a single section in VA.gov Profile.** 

**`3.` Based on prior research, we believe Veterans will want all of their contacts in a single section in VA.gov Profile.**
