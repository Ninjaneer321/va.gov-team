## **Research Goals**

The goal of this research is to inform iteration on the information architecture of the VA.gov Profile Hub based on previous user feedback and analytics in order to incorporate new features. [Desk research for reference.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2025-03-profile-secondary-research/research-findings.md#military-information)

1. Validate if incorporating the ILER IES report into a new Letters and documents section in VA.gov Profile matches Veterans mental models.

2. Validate if updating VA.gov Profile Hub to reflect recommendations from prior research and analytics match Veteran mental models.


### **Outcomes**

Outcome will be a validated IA for incorporating new sections into VA.gov Profile Hub, including a Letters and documents section to house the downloadable ILER IES report.


### **Veteran Journey**

- `Starting Up`
- `Taking Care of Myself`
- `Retiring`
- `Aging`

## **Research Questions**

1. Do Veterans associate the ILER IES report with Letters and documents?

2. Do recommendations to VA.gov Profile Hub, based on prior research and analytics, match Veterans mental models?


## **Methodology** 

We conducted an **unmoderated** **tree test with Veterans who have a VA.gov or My HealthyVet account** on Optimal Workshop. The test consisted of ten randomized tasks requesting participants to locate where they’d expect to find information in the VA.gov Profile.

**We recruited XX participants total.** Of those, XX were usable responses, unusable responses were removed using the [Platform data scrubbing guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/conducting-unmoderated-research#Conductingunmoderatedresearch-data-cleaningDatascrubbingguidance).

Responses were then evaluated against success rate to complete the task. Any tasks that rated higher than 60%+ success rate were considered successful enough to move forward with. Those with lower than 59% success rate are to be re-evaluated based on participant selections.

The analysis approach was supported by [Optimal Workshop](https://support.optimalworkshop.com/en/collections/1524581-tree-testing?_gl=1*sd3k48*_gcl_au*ODU4MDMzMDEwLjE3NDU1ODY5MzY) and [Neilson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interpreting-tree-test-results/).
