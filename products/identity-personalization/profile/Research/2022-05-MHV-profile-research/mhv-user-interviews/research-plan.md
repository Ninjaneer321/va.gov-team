# Research Plan for MHV personal information, Veteran interviews, March 2022
## Background
MyHealtheVet (MHV) has its own profile, which is part of a larger Personal Information section. In support of the health apartment transition, we need to understand how Veterans currently use this part of MHV in order to inform our approach to aligning the MHV profile with the VA.gov profile.

[Link to project outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research).

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports these OCTO objectives:
1. Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.

## Research Goals	
Through this research, we’d like to understand:
1. How MHV users use the personal information sections, especially certain fields in My Profile and the My Links section.
2. Where MHV users expect to find health-related profile information.

### Outcome
We’ll use our findings to inform our strategy for moving forward with rolling the MHV profile into the VA.gov profile.  

### Research questions
1. What level of familiarity do MHV users have with the personal information section?
2. How do MHV users update their personal information, if not through the MHV profile?
3. How useful are the personal information sections to MHV users? Specifically, we want to know how Veterans use:
- the “My VA Treating Facility fields”
- the “My relationship with the VA field”
- the Health information card
- the My links feature
- the In Case of emergency feature
3. What information from the personal information section is important for a MHV user to be able to edit?
4. How might the current VA.gov profile meet MHV user needs?
5. Where do MHV users expect to find health-related preference and personal information, such as blood type and treating facilites?

### Hypothesis
1. Since MHV users completed registration only one time (if at all), and their data was then matched with MPI, they won’t have a lot of familiarity with the personal information section.
2. Since MHV users have been taught that their MHV profile data doesn’t go through the whole VA system, MHV users update their personal information at a clinic or over the phone.
3. Since analytics show low page visits compared with the rest of MHV pages, the pages in the personal information section are not useful to MHV users.
4. Since there is little context around the “My VA treating facility” fields, Veterans will be confused and unclear about this feature.
5. In previous studies, we’ve heard that Veterans expect the VA to know certain things about them. We hypothesize the “My relationship with the VA” field will not be useful to Veterans. They will expect the VA to know that about them without them having to check a box.
6. MHV users will prioritize being able to edit contact information and prescriptions since those are the things about that with the most potential to change.
7. Since MHV users are used to seeing personal health-related information and preferences within the context of their healthcare, they’ll expect to find this in the health apartment rather than in their profile.
8. Previous research has shown that the VA.gov profile meets Veteran expectations, so we expect that it will mostly meet the needs of MHV users. The exception will be the absence of MHV notification settings.

## Method	
We’ll conduct semi-structured interview, and a moderated hybrid card sort using OptimalWorkshop.

### Location
Remote via zoom.

## Recruitment	
### Recruitment approach
We’ll use Perigean’s recruitment services

### Recruitment criteria
Please recruit 20 participants for 10 completed sessions. 

#### Primary criteria (must-haves)
1. Have a MHV premium account and logged in for reasons other than this research study within the last 12 months.
**Qualifying questions**:  
	1. Do you have a MHV account? (Answer must be yes to qualify)
	2. Is your account a basic or premium account? Your account level can be seen next to the welcome message once you are signed in. (Answer must by premium to qualify)
	3. Have you used any features on MHV within the last 12 months? Features include secure messaging, refilling prescriptions, accessing medical records. (Answer must be yes to qualify)
1. At least 50% must have received care in VA medical facilites in two different states in the last 18 months.
**Qualifying question:**
Within the last 18 months, have you been to VA medical centers **in two different states** to receive care? (Answer must be yes to qualify)
3. Be willing to login to their MHV account and share their screen via Zoom with the facilitator (will expose personal information).
4. At least 50% must identify as Black, Hispanic/Latina/Latinx, or Native.
5. At least 50% must identify as having a cognitive consideration.
6. At least 50% must identify as other than male.

8. At least 25% are under 35
9. At least 25% are over 55

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
* 100% have an identified cognitive disability (*anyone* can acquire a cognitive disability)
* More than 50% age 55 or older
* More than 50% in a rural area

## Timeline
We’ll run research sessions from March 30-April 5, 2022.

### Length of sessions
60 minutes

### Availability
Please schedule 15 minutes between sessions, and no more than 5 sessions per day:
| Date | Time (est) |
