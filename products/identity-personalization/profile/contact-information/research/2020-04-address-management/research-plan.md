# Research Plan Veteran Address Management, April - May 2020

## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
- Address Management, VA VEO, Multi-Channel Technologies (MCT)

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 
- There are currently several ways for a veteran to update their contact information and addresses across VA services. VA Profile is intended to be the single repository for veteran address information, but processes, policies, and procedures to integrate with VA Profile need to be defined. Addresses are still stored across different systems, many of which are legacy systems that present interoperability challenges.Veterans have multiple channels through which they can update an address, but it’s unclear what departments in the VA receive those changes and which do not. Additionally, an update might not spread across all platforms, and there is inconsistency in the number and nomenclature of addresses between systems. Our team has been brought on to understand how veterans and caregivers need to update their contact information, and what VA employees and clinicians need to accommodate those updates.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
- How do veterans use addresses within the VA?
- How do veterans manage their VA addresses?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?
- Understanding address management more comprehensively will help improve it.

## Method
1. What method of research are you planning? 
- Directed interviews
- Remote interviews
  
2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
- Interviewing users about their experience will help us understand the processes they go through, and help us identify areas of improvement.

3. Where are you planning to do your research?
- Remote sessions using approved screen-sharing and recording software.

4. What will you be testing?
- How veterans/patients add and update their address within the VA and what impact it has on them.

5. If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)
- Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment
1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
- 8-10 veterans or VA patients
    *Required: Has updated their address with the VA in the last year or so via VA.gov, via   phone (eg. call center), or in person at a VA facility
    *Required: Is enrolled in and receiving VA Benefits (such as Disability/Comp&Pension/GI Bill/VA Home Loan/Health Care/Care in the Community)
    *Optional: Uses VA.gov to update their addresses
    *Optional: Has used or receives mail-order prescriptions 
- Participants must have access to a computer with reliable internet access and a working microphone and camera
- No age, accessibility, or location requirements

2. What is your recruitment strategy? 
We are working with Lauren Alexanderson and DSVA to collaborate on participant recruiting through the existing recruiting contract.

## When?
1. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
- April 2020 through mid-May 2020

2. Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?
- N/A, we are researching existing systems and concepts

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?
- 45 minutes to an hour

4. Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?
- Between 11am and 7pm ET to account for team members in both ET, CT, and PT zones.

5. Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?
- N/A
