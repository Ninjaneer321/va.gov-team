## Current experience
- For all of these use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). If the user is not LOA3, the user will be directed to the Profile Account Security section. [See LOA1 account documentation.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/use-cases/loa1-user.md)
- All information on the page, other than login email, is editable, including: addresses, phone numbers, and contact email.


## Common use cases
### User logs in with LOA1 account
