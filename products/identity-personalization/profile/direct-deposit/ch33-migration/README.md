## Overview 
Chapter 33 (Ch33) education benefits are paid to veterans using a system called BDN. BDN is a legacy system that is gradually being retired and various benefits are migrating to newer payment/management systems. VBA is starting with the largest EDU portfolio, Ch33 and migrating payment processing from BDN to CorpDB where payments will run through eMPWR. In this new system, there can only be ONE set of payment instructions. As an example, Comp&Pen (C&P) benefits have already been migrated to CorpDB.

Today, if veterans receive CH33 and C&P benefits, there are two separate payment processes running, one from BDN and the other from CorpDB. This allows veterans to input separate payment information for each benefit. As the VA migrates CH33 to the new system, payment instructions for both types of benefits must be identical.  






## Problem Statement 
CorpDB limits the payee information per person to one set of payment instructions, any veteran that receives both C&P and CH33 benefits must have ONE set of payment instructions on file in CorpDB. 

## Proposed Solution 
CH33 EDU benefits likely need to pass information through Lighthouse
