## Overview
The Elizabeth Dole Veterans Program Improvement Act of 2022 includes provisions aimed at enhancing veterans' access to healthcare services, including specific requirements related to appointment scheduling preferences. Here are some key points:

The act mandates that (VA) must take into account individual veterans' scheduling preferences to a reasonable extent when arranging appointments for healthcare services. This includes preferences for dates, times, and locations that best suit the veterans' needs and availability.

## Problem Statement
Veterans have different options and modalities for scheduling community care appointments but nowhere to enter in their preferences for how they'd like to complete scheduling. This means that VA staff may be reaching out in channels or at times that are not convenient to the Veteran or are wasting time and resources calling a veteran who would prefer to self schedule. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- As a Veteran, I want scheduling a community care appointment to be easy and happen how and when it is convenient for me.
- As a Veteran, I want the scheduling of community care appointments to happen quickly and efficiently.
- As a Veteran, I don't want to be contacted in channels or at times that are not convenient to me.
  
## Undesired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran, I don't want to set preferences for scheduling community care appointments and then have those preferences be ignored.
- As a Veteran, I don't want it to be confusing what my preferences are for (i.e. community care vs. VA care).


## Desired Business Outcomes

- VA should be able to scheduling appointments more efficiently and reduce the amount of outreach and time spent on scheduling appointments.

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Preferences should not lead to more confusion and overhead for VA staff responsible for scheduling community care appointments.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

As a Veteran I want to document 4 specific preferences related to Veteran self-scheduling in community care. (see below)

Our idea is to store the preferences in VA profile, enable Veterans to update them in VA.gov, and enable schedulers/MSAs to also be able to view/update them in ISS.

(1) How and when the veteran prefers to be contacted about an appointment for health care.
(2) Whether the veteran prefers to schedule appointments without the assistance of the Department, if able.
(3) Whether the veteran prefers to select a provider without the assistance of the Department, if able.
(4) Whether the veteran prefers appointments to be scheduled during certain days or times.
