# Conversation Guide - Stakeholders

## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and  [attendees] are also here from the authenticated experience team.  As you probably know, we're in the discovery phase for a revamped logged in homepage experience.  We're excited to learn from your perspective on this work.

## Background
1. Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on va.gov
2. How long have you been in this role?
3. Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

## Logged in homepage
1. How were you involved with the vets.gov to va.gov transition, as it pertains to the logged in homepage/myVA experience ?
2. What problems have you noticed about the current logged in homepage and myVA experiences?
3. How would an update to the logged in homepage experience impact your work?
4. What are your goals for a new logged in homepage experience?
5. What does success look like to you? How would you know this project has succeeded?
6. What metrics would you be interested in seeing around a logged in homepage?
7. What logged in homepage/dashboard experiences have you come across that work well, and not so well? How about notifications?
8. What might make this project easier or harder in any specific ways, as it relates to your role on va.gov, or your team?
9. What concerns do you have about this project? What do you imagine going wrong? 
10. Is there anyone else you think we should talk to?

## Practice Specific

### Design
1. Can you show me some of your designs and talk about why you made some of those decisions?
2. Have you worked on anything similar to this on other (non-VA) projects? What worked/didn't work?
