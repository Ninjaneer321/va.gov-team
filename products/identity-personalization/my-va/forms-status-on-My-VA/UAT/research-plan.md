# 2024-09 UAT Forms Status on My VA Research Plan

## Background

To test the success of the form status implementation, there is a dilemma in finding participants who have already submitted one of the seven forms that are part of the MVP and having their test sessions expedited. Due to this, the team has uncertainty on proceeding with a formal UAT process - can we achieve goals realistically, and how much time/resources will be required to make it happen? 

On August 28, 2024, the My VA team held internal discussions as well as a meeting with Perigean to talk through the challenges of recruiting Veterans for this UAT effort. 

Based on those conversations, there are two possible paths we can take moving forward:

- Starting a "rolling research recruitment" with Perigean in which we actively recruit participants and get them in sessions quickly. Perigean has recommended alloting multiple weeks for this in order to ensure we get enough participants.

  - If we take this approach, we are likely looking at a delayed rollout to Production, with uncertain ability to really test both of the standard statuses that can appear for users (submission in progress, received).
  - Shannon Housel has recommended that we plan on hour long sessions just to account for technical difficulties, while cautioning that users may unintentionally report in screeners that they have done one of the seven forms when they have not.

- Relying instead on QA in Staging, as well as attempting to get assistance from internal OCTO users of VA.gov with UAT using their own personal accounts.

  - Recruiting internally may have its own challengers.
  - QA and internal UAT alone may not be sufficient.
