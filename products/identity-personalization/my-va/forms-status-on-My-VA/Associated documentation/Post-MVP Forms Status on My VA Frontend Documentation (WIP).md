# Post-MVP Forms Status on My VA Frontend Documentation (WIP)

**Last updated: October 17, 2024 - File created**

_As of Oct. 17, 2024_ - During the course of MVP design and research there were multiple points of functionality that were planned as future enhancements. 
In addition, support for PDF downloads were not able to make the cut during development for MVP due to technical constraints, and so that will be a future enhancement as well. 
Also, the 21-0966 form was pulled from MVP due to an inability to consistently let users know the status of its submission without further engineering work to make that possible - it will also be coming in a future iteration of form status functionality.

The future enhancements are as follows (the order of items does not indicate their level of priority):

- PDF download support on form status cards (Submission in progress, Received, Action needed)
- Support for 21-0966
- The addition of a page level alert that appears at the top of My VA, indicating when a form submission has had a detectable system-based error
- Possible update to content in cards
- Possible addition of a Process List component, mirroring the one shown on the submission confirmation page
- Possible removal of the 'error' icon on the Draft cards
- Possible addition of truncation and dedicated page for form status cards
- Possible addition of secondary link going to a dedicated Resources page for form statuses
