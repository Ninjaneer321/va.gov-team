# Technical Discovery: Form Status - API Integration and Backend Implementation

## Background

For FE discovery, see Allison's doc: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/80504#issuecomment-2070801477

On BE, we need to ensure that FE can reliably fetch up-to-date form status for each form associated with the vet's user account.

## Design Notes

Looks like we may be able to leverage existing endpoints and redux cache for the "status" values that we can use to display the new Status Tags on MyVA UI.

However, doesn't look like matching statuses exist in redux at the moment (at least in the metadata object shown above), and we may need to fetch or poll form statuses separately from the initialization of the `profile.user` data in redux upon login.

It might be confusing to require that FE Components stitch together this metadata themselves from separate remote sources (especially if we need to paginate in future), so we could reuse this `savedForms` array as the source of truth for the list of benefit forms and associated statuses we display in our UI.  The `/v0/user` endpoint appears to fetch the array of saved forms currently, so we may be able to update this endpoint to also include statuses for each item in savedForms array. 

If we don't want to overload the main `user` endpoint, we could also handle it in the FE by issuing separate fetch requests (i.e. request user w/ saved forms array, then fetch statuses for all returned forms) and merging state with our redux reducers.

Another way to go about this could be to fetch these statuses separately in the FE, and maintain a map of form statuses (`[FORM_ID, FORM_STATUS]`) in Redux or React Context, so that React Components can reference a form's status by ID to display the appropriate Tag for a form.

We should also ensure FE can refresh form statuses appropriately when navigating away from and back to MyVA page... will this require refetching full `/v0/user` data, or can we just refresh the list of forms and statuses?

I can work with Allison to help build whatever works best for DX and UI.

## Relevant Endpoints

GET /v0/user

GET /uploads/{id}
POST /uploads/report


## Concerns

I'm still not clear on all of the "Error" cases we need to watch out for.  We should at least be prepared to cover the known cases:
- Network Request fails; no status is available
- API request for statuses fails with documented error code
- API request returns with a Status of "Error"

Will any of these endpoints be changing after we begin UI integration (aside from non-breaking bug fixes)? Sounded like there were still questions in the air after our last meeting about this.

## Tasks

- [ ] Align on data requirements and FE design with team. (~3 pts)
- [ ] Align with Benefit Forms team on purpose of "Error" status and finalized list of statuses we should expect (we can grow list over time if necessary) (~? pts)
- [ ] Verify intended purpose of existing `metadata.submission.status` value in redux store w/ devs and benefit forms team.(~1 pt)
- [ ] BE/FE dev & support for API integration tasks and coding (~5+ pts)
- [ ] Cypress test plan and test creation for expected statuses and test cases (including expected errors) (~5 pts)
