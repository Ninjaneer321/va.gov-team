_The documentation and deck created by the Mobile App team should be reviewed in addition to this document of takeaways that are relevant for Authenticated Experience. Some of what is stated here was covered in the presentation of findings that occured on July 30th, 2024 in a Mobile Sprint demo meeting._

## Accessibility considerations

### The research effort was unable to recruit any screen reader users. To try and compensate for that gap, the mobile team:
  - Went through additional a11y review internally.
  - Are setting up sessions with blind veterans groups to demo their new functionality in the hope that this can help facilitate educating veterans who use assitive tech.
 
## Other takeaways
- Issues that correspond with vets-api may be causing issues with the display of military info in the personalized app experience, including the display of military branch. It is unclear if this has any direct relevance to the web personalized experience (such as with the Nametag component and Profile), more investigation may be required.
