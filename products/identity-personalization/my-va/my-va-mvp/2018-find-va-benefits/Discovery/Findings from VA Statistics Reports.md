# Findings from [2010 National Survey of Veterans](https://www.va.gov/vetdata/docs/SurveysAndStudies/NVSSurveyFinalWeightedReport.pdf)

Caveats:
- This data is 8 years old -- take it with a grain of salt, though suspicion is that the numbers still largely hold true
- These findings drove the mandate to create [explore.va.gov](https://explore.va.gov), their primary aim being to solve these discoverability issues

## Overall benefit awareness and understanding

### Percentage of Veterans indicating they understood their benefits "A lot" or "some"

- Benefits available to me: **41.0%**
- Education and training: **37.7%**
- Home Loan Guaranty: **35.4%**
- Health care: **34.1%** overall
  - **74.4%** of enrollees
  - **19.5%** of non-enrollees
- Burial benefits: **29.0%**
- Life insurance: **20.0%**

## Reasons for not applying for a benefit

### Top 5 reasons for not applying across all benefit verticals

1. Not aware of the benefit
2. Don't need the benefit
3. Never thought about it / never considered applying
4. Don't know how to apply
5. Don't think I'm entitled/eligible

### Noteable insights on particular benefits

- Disability benefits and VR&E: "don't need the benefit" is closely tied to "don't think I'm entitled", "don't think disability is severe enough", and "dont need or want assistance from VA"
- Health care & burial benefits are the most common where Veterans are likely to get the service somewhere else
- Core reasons against applying for home loans and burial benefits were due to inconvenience of the home loan program and distance of VA cemeteries, respectively
- Many more Veterans are unaware of life insurance than any other benefit
- Expiration of education benefits and lapse of life insurance benefits are common

### Relevant statistics

* Page xiii — "Those who indicated they had not applied for disability benefits were asked why they had not applied. The majority (66.2%) indicated that they did not have a service-connected disability. However, 17.1 percent indicated that they were not aware of the VA service- connected disability program." On page 111, it says that 36.6% of people assume their disability wasn't severe enough.
* Page xiv — "More than 42 percent of Veterans who have never used VA health care indicated they were not aware of VA health care benefits. Also, over 26 percent indicated they did not know how to apply for benefits."
* Page xv — "Those Veterans who had not used VA education benefits were asked why they had not used them. More than 36 percent indicated that they were unaware of VA education and training benefits."
* Page 89 — In the 12 months prior to the survey:
  * 19.8% of veterans reported searching for healthcare.
  * 4.5% of veterans reported searching for life insurance.
  * 10.2% of veterans reported searching for education benefits.
  * 12% of veterans reported searching for disability compensation.
* Page xvi — "Almost two-thirds (65.8%) of Veterans who do not have VA life insurance reported that they were unaware of this benefit. More than a quarter indicated that they did not know how to apply for these benefits (27.4%)."
