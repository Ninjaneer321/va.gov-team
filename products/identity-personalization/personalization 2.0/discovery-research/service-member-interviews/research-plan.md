# Research plan for Dragons: Personalization 2.0 Separating Service Member Interviews

## Goals
1. **What product & team are you doing this research for?**

Dragons/Personalization. This is part of the personalization 2.0 effort.

2. **Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?** 

The MVPs of the My VA dashboard, user profile, and account settings page launched in the spring of 2018. A year in, the dragons team has decided to revisit these personalized products to evaluate what is going well and what can be improved, removed, added, or reorganized. We kicked off discovery for personalization 2.0 with research that explored [veterans' use of the My VA dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Dashboard%20interviews/Research%20Summary.md) (or lack thereof). We'd like to follow this research by learning more about how separating service members approach onboarding at the VA, and how their needs differ from more seasoned veterans.

3. **Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?**

- What are the most pressing questions separating service members have as they are leaving the service?
- How can we help service members onboard/get started at the VA? How can this supplement programs like TAP (if they have been through it)?
- Where do separating service members go or expect to find the resources they are looking for?
- How do separating service members needs differ from more seasoned veterans?
- What would be helpful for separating service members to see in a dashboard/profile/account settings?
- What have we not considered? What do we not know that we don't know?

4. **Hypothesis: What are your hypotheses for this research?** 

- Separating service members will have differing needs from veterans who have been separated from the service for a longer period of time.
- Separating service members may find a personalized dashboard more useful since they are in the process of learning about and preparing to apply for benefits.


## Method

1.	**What method of research are you planning?** 

- Moderated user interviews.
  
2.	**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?** 

- The best way to assess separating service member needs is through an open ended discussion.

3.	**Where are you planning to do your research?**

- Remotely via GTM.

4.	**What will you be testing?**

- We may look at the VA.gov website, but we'll mostly be having a conversation. We will not be looking at a a prototype or new functionality.

## Participants and Recruitment

1.	**Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

We are looking for **3 separating service members** who meet the following criteria:

- These service members **must** be within one year of separation and must have **received their separation orders**.
- Participants must be interested in receiving at least one benefit from the VA.
- If anyone has been through TAP (transition program), that would be a bonus.
- Participants must be able to access GTM during the call since we may do some screensharing.

2.	**What is your recruitment strategy?**

We plan to work with Perigean to find participants.

## When? 

1.	**Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?** 

We understand it may take longer to find these participants than it takes to find veteran participants. Given this, we hope to do research **Monday, August 5 through Friday, August 9**. If this is not possible, we are also able to do testing **Monda, August 12 through Friday August 16**. Our strong preference is the week of August 5 but we understand we may have to postpone another week if we are unable to get service members by then.

One other preference — we would like all interviews to be within the same week if possible. Please only offer appointments across the two weeks as a last resort if we're having trouble finding people. Otherwise, let's stick with either the August 5th week or the August 12th week.

2.	**Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?**

We do not need to prepare anything besides a conversation guide for testing.

3. **Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?**

We expect sessions to be 45 – 60 minutes.

4.	**Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. 

**Availability week of 8/5**

- **M**: 9:00am – 6:00pm
- **T**: Currently unavailable, but will let you know if this opens up

- **F**: 9:30 am – 4:30 pm


5.	**Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?**

We do not need to prepare anything besides a conversation guide for testing.
