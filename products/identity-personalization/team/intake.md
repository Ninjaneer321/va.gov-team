# Authenticated experience intake form

`3rd DRAFT`

## Our Team 

Before you submit an intake ticket, we want to make sure you’re in the right place. 

### Who we are:
The Authenticated Experience team has two main products My VA and Profile. Profile is the frontend used to allow users to update important information. My VA is a dashboard that seeks to surface relevant, actionable, time sensitive information to veterans about different VA benefits. 

We also have two smaller product, Nametag and the Authenticated Menu

### Who we are not: 
- We’re not VA Profile, the backend system does support us but is a different team. 
- We’re not MyHealtheVet as our products support many different benefits, not exclusively healthcare.
