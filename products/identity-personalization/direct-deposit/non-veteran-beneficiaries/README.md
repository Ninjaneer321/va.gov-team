## Overview 
This initiative ensures that non-veteran beneficiaries—such as dependents, spouses, and survivors— are informed that they are only able to view their direct deposit information on VA.gov and must call in for updates. Read access was revoked by BGS and Lighthouse and we will need to work at a later time to allow user's access to the edit features. 

## Purpose
- Provide information on how non-veteran beneficiaries (e.g., dependents, survivors) can **view** their direct deposit details.
- Explain why online updates are not supported and how users can make changes via VA assistance.

## Eligibility
- Defines who is considered a non-veteran beneficiary:
  - Spouses receiving VA benefits
  - Dependents
  - Survivors (e.g., receiving Dependency and Indemnity Compensation)

## Access to Direct Deposit Information

### Read-Only View
- Non-veteran beneficiaries can **view** their current direct deposit details (e.g., masked account number, bank name).
- Displayed in a read-only format within the Profile section of VA.gov.

### Online Updates Not Supported
- Direct deposit updates are **not available online** for non-veteran beneficiaries.
- Users will see a message explaining this limitation and the steps to take.
