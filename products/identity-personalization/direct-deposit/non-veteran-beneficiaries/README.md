# Direct Deposit for Non-Veteran Beneficiaries

## Overview 
This initiative ensures that non-veteran beneficiaries—such as dependents, spouses, and survivors—can securely view their direct deposit information on VA.gov. Read access was revoked by BGS and Lighthouse and we will need to work at a later time to allow user's access to the edit features. 

## Purpose
- Provide information on how non-veteran beneficiaries (e.g., dependents, survivors) can **view** their direct deposit details.
- Explain why online updates are not supported and how users can make changes via VA assistance.

## Eligibility
- Defines who is considered a non-veteran beneficiary:
  - Spouses receiving VA benefits
  - Dependents
  - Survivors (e.g., receiving Dependency and Indemnity Compensation)

## Access to Direct Deposit Information

### Read-Only View
- Non-veteran beneficiaries can **view** their current direct deposit details (e.g., masked account number, bank name).
- Displayed in a read-only format within the Profile section of VA.gov.

### Online Updates Not Supported
- Direct deposit updates are **not available online** for non-veteran beneficiaries.
- Users will see a message explaining this limitation and the steps to take.
