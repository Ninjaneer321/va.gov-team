# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, VA 	Onboarding Generative Research, March 2024
## Background
The VA.gov authenticated experience thus far has been primarily focused on the user journey for existing Veterans or other VA beneficiaries - i.e. Veterans or beneficiaries who are already active in and relatively familiar with VA.gov by way of claim submission, applying for health care and engaging with other VA-sponsored benefits. 

We want to conduct generative research to build a baseline understanding of the transition process from active duty military to Veteran status, so that we can evaluate the impact VA.gov may have on the process of onboarding to VA overall.

[Project outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/README.md).

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the 2024 goal “Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.”

### Veteran Journey
This research is most closely related moments that matter within three early phases of the Veteran journey ([journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)). 
- **Serving:** Managing military and family obligations
- **Getting out:** Understanding the process of separating
- **Starting up:** Attending to health needs and finding a place to live 

## Research Goals	
Our primary goal with this research is to identify any problems people experience when separating from the military that a could be improved or resolved by VA.gov. 
 
### Outcome
This research will help us determine if we need to make changes to existing VA.gov features, or build new ones, to help people onboard to VA.

### Research questions
1. What role does VA.gov have in onboarding people to VA?
2. What changes, if any, could we make to improve the experience of onboarding to VA through VA.gov?
3. What challenges do people have using VA.gov when they're using it for the first time
4. Where does VA.gov fit within the mental model of people who are onboarding to VA?
5. What are the top questions transitioning service members have about VA?

### Hypothesis
Based on what we learned in our [previous research review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/research-review.md), we hypothesize that we’ll learn: 
- VA.gov will be able to improve the process of onboarding to VA through content and IA updates targeted to service members:
  - eligibility
  - applying for benefits
  - benefits of creating a VA.gov account.
- People will want a personalized experience when onboarding to VA that reflects their specific situation, but not necessarily expect that to be possible through a government agency like VA.
- There isn’t a single online tool or experience that will resolve problems people have onboarding to VA.

## Methodology	
We’re planning to conduct remote, semi-structured interviews over Zoom.

## Recruitment	
### Recruitment approach
We want to use Perigean to recruit **13 participants for a total of 1 completed pilot session and 8 completed formal sessions.**

### Recruitment criteria
- At least 6 participants must be active duty service members who will be separating from service by December 31, 2024.
- At least 6 participants must be Veterans who separated from service on or after June 1, 2023.
- Participants should represent a mix of branches:
  - At least 2 Army 
  - At least 2 Navy or Coast Guard
  - At least 2 Marine
  - At least 2 Air Force or Space Force
- Participants should represent a mix of experience with VA, and with VA.gov. 
  - at least 3 should have no direct experience with VA or VA.gov
  - at least 3 should have some experience with VA, but no experience with VA.gov
  - at least 3 should have some experience with VA.gov
- Participants should represent a mix of genders and ethnicities.
  - At least 5, no more than 8, who identify as other than male
  - At least 5, no more than 8, who identify as other than Caucasian

## Timeline
### Prepare
We aren’t planning to review any artifacts during the session, other than perhaps VA.gov if the conversation leads that way. Our conversation guide will be complete at the time of submission.

#### Kickoff meeting
We’d like to have a kickoff meeting with Perigean prior to starting recruiting. We’ll be available for the kick off during the following days/times, all in ET:
- March 19 between 9am-11:30am
- March 20 between 10am-12pm, or 12:30pm-3:30pm

### Pilot session
We’d like Perigean to recruit **two pilot participants** that meet the criteria outlined above. We’re asking for 2 pilots in case one cancels or can’t show up. If they both do, the second pilot participant will count toward our completed sessions.

We will be available for a pilot session on the following days/times in ET:
- March 21 between 10am-5pm
- March 22 between 9am-4pm
- March 25 between 10am-5pm

**Please only schedule one pilot participant per day**, so we have time to make any adjustments needed prior to the next session.

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: March 26-29
* Please reserve March 29 for reschedules or additional participants if needed for no shows

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 60 minutes
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 4
