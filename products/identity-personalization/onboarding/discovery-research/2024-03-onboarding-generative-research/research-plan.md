# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, VA 	Onboarding Generative Research, March 2024
## Background
The VA.gov authenticated experience thus far has been primarily focused on the user journey for existing Veterans or other VA beneficiaries - i.e. Veterans or beneficiaries who are already active in and relatively familiar with VA.gov by way of claim submission, applying for health care and engaging with other VA-sponsored benefits. 

We want to conduct generative research to build a baseline understanding of the transition process from active duty military to Veteran status, so that we can evaluate the impact VA.gov may have on the process of onboarding to VA overall.

[Project outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/README.md).

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the 2024 goal “Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.”

### Veteran Journey
This research is most closely related moments that matter within three early phases of the Veteran journey ([journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)). 
- **Serving:** Managing military and family obligations
- **Getting out:** Understanding the process of separating
- **Starting up:** Attending to health needs and finding a place to live 

## Research Goals	
Our primary goal with this research is to identify any problems people experiencing when separating from the military that a could be improved or resolved by VA.gov. 
 
### Outcome
This research will help us determine if we need to make changes to existing VA.gov features, or build new ones, to help people onboard to VA.

### Research questions
1. What role does VA.gov have in onboarding people to VA?
2. What changes, if any, could we make to improve the experience of onboarding to VA through VA.gov?
3. What challenges do people have using VA.gov when they're using it for the first time
4. Where does VA.gov fit within the mental model of people who are onboarding to VA?
5. What are the top questions transitioning service members have about VA?

### Hypothesis
Based on what we learned in our [previous research review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/research-review.md), we hypothesize that: 
- the problems people experience when separating from the military are mostly problems that cannot be solved by VA.gov.
- the research will uncover a need for improvements to unauthenticated content and IA related to getting started with VA, particularly around the topics of eligibility, applying for benefits, and the benefits of creating a VA.gov account.
