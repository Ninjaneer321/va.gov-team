# Transitioning Service Member Engagement with VA, Generative Research, Findings Summary
`Draft`

## Participants
- We’ve talked to 6 participants so far
- 2 active duty service members, and 4 veterans who separated from service within the last 9 months
- Perigean wasn’t able to recruit *anyone* who had zero experience with VA or VA.gov.

## Preliminary answers to research questions
### What role does VA.gov have in onboarding people to VA?
We’ve heard the website plays to primary roles when people are onboarding to VA:
- It’s an introduction to the available benefits and eligibility
- It’s a tool for people to easily and quickly apply for benefits
- It’s a resource people know they can go back to when a need for benefits arises later on
### What changes, if any, could we make to improve the experience of onboarding to VA through VA.gov?
Most participants had never seen the service member benefits section of the site and stated it would’ve been useful to see when they were separating, or it is useful to them now as they plan for civilian life. Elevating this content on the site may be one of the most impactful and low-lift things we could do immediately. 

We heard a variety of suggestions from participants about what would’ve made their particular experience easier. All suggestions came from only 1 participant unless otherwise indicated:
- A personalized benefits recommendation engine 
  - 2 participants who were unfamiliar with the site expected to see this once they logged in, based on what was in their user profile
- Adding a “New to VA?” Call out on the homepage to point people to service member benefits, or creating a separate navigation item in the main menu for people new to VA.
- Visual aids or flow charts to better understand the claims process
- A checklist of steps you need to take when you leave service 
- a calculator for reservists to determine how their drill weekends (term?) impacted their disability payments

### What challenges do people have using VA.gov when they're using it for the first time?
- The most common challenge we heard about were issues related to creating a verified identity through ID.me
  - 1 participant gave up on creating an account all together and won’t use VA.gov
  - 1 participant eventually created a login.gov LOA3 account
- All of our participants found the website itself easy to use once they logged in. Many commented that it exceed their expectations.
### Where does VA.gov fit within the mental model of people who are onboarding to VA?
People we spoke to see VA.gov as an authoritative resource for benefit and eligibility information; something they can access as-needed when the need for benefits arises.
### What are the top questions transitioning service members have about VA?
We haven’t heard many consistent questions across participants.  The people we spoke to already had a general sense of the benefits they were going to use based on need, which they learned through peers and TAP.
The questions people named were:
- What are the steps in the claims process?
- What benefits are there that I’m not aware of?
- How can I add my family members and dependents to VA health care?
## High-level themes
### Many participants started engaging with VA before they leave the military.
- 2 participants submitted a BDD claim.
- 3 participants used VA education benefits while on active duty.
- Word-of-mouth was the most common way these participants heard about the benefit and how to apply (rather than through their command or some kind of official training)
- Most initially heard about VA benefits and services through family or peers.
### Not all Veterans go through TAP training
- It’s not required for everyone
  - One person who was in the reserves didn’t have the option
  - TAP was not offered to a Navy veteran who was honorably discharged after 2 years
- Sometimes, people have to unexpectedly separate and are not able to enroll in a TAP training in time, because the trainings get full.
- People who separated prior to 2010 (possibly even later) didn’t have the option for TAP training and there wasn’t any kind of training or intro to VA for these folks
### The disability claim process is a source of confusion for people new to VA.
- Multiple participants have talked about various aspects of the process being confusing, including:
  - the steps in the claims process
  - why claims sit in the same status for a long time
  - where to find electronic copies of letters they receive in the mail
### People generally feel VA.gov is user-friendly and easy to navigate
- They come to the website with low expectations and are surprised to find a modern website when they get there
- About half of the participants have commented that the site is well organized and the drop down menus are easy to use and browse
- Some participants have commented that there is a lot of content to digest, but believe it’s necessarily dense because of the complexity of information and variety of Veteran circumstances the content needs to address.

### Transitioning service members want more direct contacts or counseling to understand their benefit eligibility and help their transition to civilian life.
We asked participants if there were any resources they wish they had as part of their transition, and if they had a magic wand what they’d change about their experience learning about and starting to use VA benefits and services.  Their responses indicate that more personal contact would have been ideal. 
- 3/6 participants talked about wishing they had a counselor or someone they could work with directly who would advise them on what benefits they could get, based on their personal situation
- 1 participant stated the most helpful thing in helping them adjust would’ve been a local sponsor to help them get adjusted to life in a new place.
- 1 participant talked about how critical their VSO was in helping them understand their benefits

### People new to VA are generally having a positive experience and have a sense that VA is changing for the better.
- Multiple participants talked about having very low expectations based on what they’d heard, and being pleasantly surprised by their experience
- 1 participant shared how many improvements they’ve noticed during the 13 years they’ve been engaging with VA as a reservist and how much better things are today than they were 13 years ago.
- When asked “if you had a magic wand, what would you change about your experience learning about VA and starting to use VA services?” They said “Other people’s perceptions”, and talked about how much better VA is than people had said, and that they wished more Veterans would use VA.
