# Transitioning Service Member Engagement with VA, Generative Research, Findings Summary

`Draft`

April 5, 2024
## Background
The VA.gov authenticated experience thus far has been primarily focused on the user journey for existing Veterans or other VA beneficiaries - i.e. Veterans or beneficiaries who are already active in and relatively familiar with VA.gov by way of claim submission, applying for health care and engaging with other VA-sponsored benefits.

We conducted generative research with to build a baseline understanding of the transition process from active duty military to Veteran status, in order to evaluate the impact VA.gov may have on the process of onboarding to VA overall. We focused this research on transitioning service members (TSM) who were within 9 months of their separation date (getting out of the military)

### OCTO Priorities
This research supports the 2024 goal “Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.”
### Veteran Journey
This research is most closely related to moments that matter within three early phases of the Veteran journey (~[journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)~).
* **Serving:** Managing military and family obligations
* **Getting out:** Understanding the process of separating
* **Starting up:** Attending to health needs and finding a place to live
## Research Goals
Our primary goal with this research was to identify any problems people experience when separating from the military that could be improved or resolved through VA.gov.
### Outcome
This research will help us determine if we need to make changes to existing VA.gov features, or build new ones, to help people get started with VA.
### Research questions
1. What role does VA.gov have in onboarding people to VA?
2. Where does VA.gov fit within the mental model of people who are onboarding to VA?
3. What changes, if any, could we make to improve the experience of onboarding to VA through VA.gov?
4. What challenges do people have using VA.gov when they're using it for the first time?
5. What are the top questions transitioning service members have about VA?

## Methodology
* We conducted our sessions remotely, using Zoom.
* We interviewed participants to learn what they know about VA, how they’d engaged with VA so far, and what, if anything, they felt was missing or challenging in that experience.
* Then, we asked them to show us how they’ve used VA.gov so far, and review 3 sections of the site:
  * My VA
  * Profile
  * Service member benefits hub
### A note about participants
This research might not reflect the broader experience of TSMs because we weren’t able to meet our [original recruitment criteria](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/2024-03-onboarding-generative-research/research-plan.md#recruitment-criteria) due to limitations of the participant database. We want to highlight that this research skews more toward the following groups than we had planned for:
- Veterans (compared to active duty service members)
- People *without* cognitive considerations
- People who have already engaged with VA and used VA.gov
- People with post-secondary education

It’s also important to acknowledge that participants in our research studies are likely to be somewhat tech-savvy and proactive people, given the fact that they signed themselves up to participate in remote usability studies.

## Key Findings
`To come once details are finalized`

## Findings details

### 1. VA.gov is a critical self-service resource for transitioning service members to learn about VA, during and after active duty.
We consistently heard from participants that the role of VA.gov in their transition from the military is to be a resource for them to learn about their options as they plan for separation, and after they transition to civilian life.  

> I see it, now that I'm out, as a key resource or a key place to start. - P7, Veteran 

> Education is a huge part of it in terms of educating folks that are getting out about what the benefits are that they've earned, and not necessarily pushing them to access those, but just educating them on what's out there. - P12, Veteran

Multiple participants talked about it serving as a bridge to fill knowledge gaps left from their Transition Assistance Program (TAP) VA course, or what they learned from peers while in service.

> You go from civilian life to military life and the military covers all the steps for you. [When you’re] getting out, TAP is a first step, but if people don't take the information or they [have] other things on their mind, the military and the VA has the responsibility of making that transition back to civilian life just as simple as it was to join. - P4, Active Duty Service Member

They also acknowledged that the transition process takes place beyond the website:

> You have to ask the right questions, you have to network with the right people, otherwise you're not gonna get that information. I see that the VA website's trying to bridge that gap and that's good. That's really good.  But that, that's more of a tool, the VA website as opposed to a complete addressing of the issue.  - P1, Active Duty Service Member

### 2. Multiple people had challenges identity verification and heavy reading on VA.gov; we also heard some about some one-off hurdles.
#### Identity verification
- 2 participants were annoyed by having to complete identity verification; one 1 was annoyed to the point that they didn’t want to have a VA.gov account if they needed to do that.
  > I think they [TAP instructor] were using something like ID me, I was like, I'm too lazy to do that…I don’t wanna do the whole face thing. - P2, Veteran

- 1 other participant had problems with ID.me once they verified their account due to a change of address. They were unable to resolve it and instead created a login.gov account to use in the future.

#### Heavy reading
4 participants brought up the challenge of having to read and work through a lot of content on VA.gov to understand benefit information and get to the point of receiving benefits.  Most had been willing to do that work for themselves, but commented about how challenging it would be for others.
> Someone who is maybe younger, or someone that maybe has not done higher level education, I could see where they could get frustrated very quickly and potentially just say, I'm done with it. I don't even want to deal with this 14 step process before I even, you know, apply for a class [to use education benefits]. - P3, Veteran 

> I've walked three people through how to navigate the site 'cause they weren't finding the answers they needed. I would say now that I've gone through it, I would focus on that [what applies to me] more. I recommend you start looking on there and reading up on what applies to you when you know that you're separating. - P7, Veteran

> I’m not a computer literate person and I'm a flight medic. If you get a dude that was a tanker who did wrench turning for however long, he's probably gonna be even more lost on this website than me. - P10, Veteran

1 of the 4 had heard about claims being rejected, and assumed those were healthcare claims. They were interested in VA healthcare, but concerned about how claims were rejected. When they went to VA.gov to research it, they gave up because it wasn’t quick and easy to find the information they needed. Since they have private health insurance through their job, it wasn’t a priority to learn about it.

> I was trying to find information about the rejection of claims and how the claims processes work. I couldn't really find that. It wasn't clear cut to me, so I was just like, I'm [giving up on that] - P2, Veteran

#### One-off challenges
We didn’t uncover any other trends related to VA.gov challenges, but heard about a few other one-off challenges people had a hard time resolving through the website:
- Getting details about each step in the claims process
- Getting details about why a claim was rejected
- Understanding how the VA will actually pay a college once approved for Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits
- Getting their legal name corrected

### 3. Most participants were introduced to VA.gov and created a DS Logon and/or ID.me account in their TAP class, and generally found the website very easy to use.

We weren’t able to recruit participants who had no previous experience with the website, and that was primarily because people create a VA.gov account in their TAP class when they’re preparing for separation.  All participants were instructed to create a DS Logon account to sign in; some were also instructed to create an ID.me account. 

One participant used a VSO to apply for disability benefits because they’d been warned against the website by peers. However, they decided to use the site for education benefits and found it easy:
> On my own, applying for education was easy. The site made sense and everything was right the first time that I did it. - P7, Veteran

2 participants were especially surprised by how modern and easy to use VA.gov was.

> I am surprised at how well designed and user friendly it is. I thought it would be reflective of the experience I and others have had [with VA] -- inefficient and poorly designed. - P1, Active Duty Service Member

> Initially, I thought anything that had to do with the Army would be bugged out. It would be terrible. I would try to go on, and it would just, it would suck. You know, my computer would crash. It [VA.gov] was a pleasant surprise. It is actually relatively easy to navigate. It is a lot of information on there. So yeah, those [concerns] were kind of put to rest, but that's what I was initially expecting. - P11, Veteran

### 4. VA.gov could improve the experience of onboarding to VA by reducing the burden of researching benefit and eligibility information.
There were multiple things we heard throughout sessions that suggest that a significant burden is placed on Veterans to educate themselves on VA benefits and services by doing their own research.
#### The quality of TAP VA courses varies by instructor, information can be difficult to retain, and sometimes people are discouraged from attending.
> The first time I went through TAP I would say that I don't think the presenter the second time was as effective, but I think that's because she was new, and the first presenter, it was clear that he had been doing it for a while. - P12, Veteran

> It almost felt like they were trying to make everything overwhelming so that you didn't want to get out. *laughs* … Even though they [command] knew I was separating, they didn't really encourage me to take those [TAP] courses to learn anything really, honestly. It felt like they wanted me to just like sink or swim. - P11, Veteran

#### A lot of research, reading, and time is required to understand the benefits VA offers, and which ones a person qualifies for.  
> I guess [I want to] know what would apply to me, of everything they offer, and what I necessarily I wanna look for, or go toward. I've just been busy finishing my degree and then taking care of kids. I haven't had time to sit down and look at the VA website and look at what they have to offer. - P4, active duty service member

> I know whether it's the VA or other organizations that are just trying to be so transparent and provide as much information as possible, but sometimes it's information overload that it's almost too much in some aspects. - P3, Veteran

> **Moderator:** Has anything been difficult or confusing for you as you've tried to learn about what the VA can do for you? 
> **P13, active duty service member:** Yes, the “always work” environment. You're always working. So just having more time to actually sitting down and going through it. 

#### People aren’t aware of what they don’t know, which makes it hard to know which questions to ask or what to look for.
> You don't know what you don't know until you actually fill out the application. - P7, Veteran

> I know they offer other resources and services outside of disability ratings and medical treatment, but I'm not necessarily sure what those resources are. I'd love to be enlightened on them. - P1, active duty service member: 

We then asked participants if there were resources they wish they had but didn’t, and if there was anything they’d change about their experience learning about VA.  Many talked about ideas that would reduce their burden of researching, reading through information, and navigating VA on their own:

> Being more upfront about what you're eligible for based on your situation, and not having you do research or research outside of the VA to try to figure that out. - P2,Veteran

> I think it would be if the VA website uses this [personal information] intelligently and applies that information to give you kind of a outline of what you may qualify for, what programs may be of interest to you.  - P4, Active Duty Service Member

> I feel like there was a course available, like a video, and then I learned of the [benefits] that I don't have or things that I'm not utilizing that would, and if I knew I was qualified for it, that would help me utilize more [benefits]…I have terrible vision, which is one of the reasons I don't really like to read. If there was a video with subtitles, I'm pretty sure I would retain it more. - P11, Veteran

### 5. No one had seen the service member benefit hub prior to their research session; all participants thought the information was useful. 

Most participants had never seen the service member benefits section of the site and stated it would’ve been useful to see when they were separating, or it is useful to them now as they plan for civilian life. 

### 6. Top questions TSMs have about VA are related to disability and health benefits.
 
We haven’t heard many consistent questions across participants.  The people we spoke to already had a general sense of the benefits they were going to use based on need, which they learned through peers and TAP.
The questions people named were:
- What are the steps in the claims process?
- What benefits are there that I’m not aware of?
- How can I add my family members and dependents to VA health care?

## Additional insights

### Many participants started engaging with VA before they leave the military.
- 2 participants submitted a BDD claim.
- 3 participants used VA education benefits while on active duty.
- Word-of-mouth was the most common way these participants heard about the benefit and how to apply (rather than through their command or some kind of official training)
- Most initially heard about VA benefits and services through family or peers.
### Not all Veterans go through TAP training
Although many resources say TAP is required, participants in our study shared a different experience:
- One person who was in the reserves wasn’t given the option to participant when they transitioned from active duty to reserves.
- TAP was not offered at all to a Veteran who was honorably discharged after 2 years, or to a Veteran who was medically retired after more than a decade in the service.
- We learned that sometimes, people have to unexpectedly separate and are not able to enroll in a TAP training in time or that the trainings get full.
- People who separated prior to 2010 (possibly even later) didn’t have the option for TAP training and there wasn’t any kind of training or intro to VA for these folks
### The disability claim process is a source of confusion for people new to VA.
- Multiple participants have talked about various aspects of the process being confusing, including:
  - the steps in the claims process
  - why claims sit in the same status for a long time
  - where to find electronic copies of letters they receive in the mail
### 
### Transitioning service members want more direct contacts or counseling to understand their benefit eligibility and help their transition to civilian life.
We asked participants if there were any resources they wish they had as part of their transition, and if they had a magic wand what they’d change about their experience learning about and starting to use VA benefits and services.  Their responses indicate that more personal contact would have been ideal. 
- 3/6 participants talked about wishing they had a counselor or someone they could work with directly who would advise them on what benefits they could get, based on their personal situation
- 1 participant stated the most helpful thing in helping them adjust would’ve been a local sponsor to help them get adjusted to life in a new place.
- 1 participant talked about how critical their VSO was in helping them understand their benefits

### People new to VA are generally having a positive experience and have a sense that VA is changing for the better.
- Multiple participants talked about having very low expectations based on what they’d heard, and being pleasantly surprised by their experience
- 1 participant shared how many improvements they’ve noticed during the 13 years they’ve been engaging with VA as a reservist and how much better things are today than they were 13 years ago.
- When asked “if you had a magic wand, what would you change about your experience learning about VA and starting to use VA services?” They said “Other people’s perceptions”, and talked about how much better VA is than people had said, and that they wished more Veterans would use VA.

## Recommendations
### We need to consider ways we can reduce the burden of research on people who are new to VA.


Elevating this content on the site may be one of the most impactful and low-lift things we could do immediately. 

We heard a variety of suggestions from participants about what would’ve made their particular experience easier. All suggestions came from only 1 participant unless otherwise indicated:
- A personalized benefits recommendation engine 
  - 2 participants who were unfamiliar with the site expected to see this once they logged in, based on what was in their user profile
- Adding a “New to VA?” Call out on the homepage to point people to service member benefits, or creating a separate navigation item in the main menu for people new to VA.
- Visual aids or flow charts to better understand the claims process
- A checklist of steps you need to take when you leave service 
- a calculator for reservists to determine how their drill weekends (term?) impacted their disability payments
