# Transitioning Service Members: Research Review

## Background

## Research goals
We reviewed previous research to achieve the following goals:
1. Get a better understanding of the transition experience for separating service members, and the role VA.gov could play in transition.
2. Understand what we already know that could inform an onboarding solution.
3. Learn what other VA teams have done with regard to onboarding, if anything.

## Findings
### Transitioning from the service to becoming a Veteran is a process that largely takes place in the real world, not online.
It is a major adjustment for service members to acclimate to civilian life; a significant factor in this is the **lack of structure and direction, and the departure from their military community and support system**. 

The [journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/2022-Transition_JourneyMap_v10.pdf) highlights some other factors that can be particularly challenging:
- Some service members have never lived independently prior to joining the military.
  > Transition even now is just basic adult functions that you never develop or have to worry about, the basic things like budgeting, planning grocery shopping for the week that normal adults develop as they grow from teens to young adults to adults moving into their first apartment and jobs where it is developed slowly over time. We are just thrown out expecting to know it -  P2, Service Member Interviews, Personalization 2.0 research ([notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/service-member-interviews/p2_8.14.19_0900.md))
- Some service members do not want to separate from the military (e.g. forced medical retirement).
- Varied levels of separation support and guidance from their command and TAP training
  > Like I said, I went to 4 different seminars over 5 years and not a single one was the same. The basics, yes, but the focus was different. It is the quality of the briefers and what they are willing to talk about but limited to what they can provide. - P1, Service Member Interviews, Personalization 2.0 research ([notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/service-member-interviews/p1_8.7.2019_0900.md))

While a website or digital tool can serve as a resource, it would not completely solve the problem of transition.
> I don’t need three days of a slide show that gives me websites I can go to. Give me relevant information. - P2, Service Member Interviews, Personalization 2.0 research ([notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/service-member-interviews/p1_8.7.2019_0900.md))

### There are a variety of reasons Veterans don’t engage with the VA when they separate from the military.
- Echoes of Department of Defense make some Veterans uncomfortable in engaging with VA, especially if they had a bad experience in the military.
  > For some, this is due to a negative or traumatic military experience. For others, the military experience was simply a taxing one and they do not want to prolong it by interacting with VA.  - Insight 1.1, Under 40 Trust Scores, Veteran Interviews, 2023 ([pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/blob/master/research-proposals/VEO/2023-03%20Under%2040%20Trust%20Scores%20Veteran%20Interviews/U40%20Insights%20Report%20Final.pdf))
- There can be a lack of clarity around benefits eligibility.
- The complexity of VA discourages people from applying for benefits, especially for people with cognitive considerations.
  - VA services and resources are not as structured as they were in the military, which causes confusion, frustration, and ultimately, disengagement.
  - Some Veterans have a perception that using VA benefits takes them away from other Veterans who may be in greater need.
- They’re focused on the next steps for the education or career, and aren’t sure how VA fits into that.
  - For many Veterans, Transition Assistance Program (TAP) training focuses on VA health care, so they don’t hear much about other VA benefits there.

### Service members would find it helpful to receive structured and specific resources about VA and benefit eligibility, especially about benefits other than health care or disability ratings. 
- Multiple documents we reviewed talked about service members being used to receiving clear, specific and actionable information in the military, and feeling confused and discouraged by the clack of that structure in the civilian world.
  > I need my resources to provide me with **specific information** and enough time to put actionable steps into my plan.  - [Transition Personas, 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onboarding/discovery-research/2022-Transition_Personas_v6.pdf)

  > Strategic and clear messaging that states what VA does for young Veterans [is a trust maker/value creator] - Under 40 Trust Scores, Veteran Interviews, 2023 ([pdf](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/blob/master/research-proposals/VEO/2023-03%20Under%2040%20Trust%20Scores%20Veteran%20Interviews/Under40TrustExecutiveSlides_6.1.23.pdf))

- We heard that TAP training is general, and mostly focused on health care and disability benefits from VA.
  > It was something like a bit about healthcare and then you know how in elementary school you had to do a book report and you didn't have time to read all of it? That’s how it was when they did the brief, it was like that hour was up and it was back to everything else. It was a slide with contact information that you could go to this website. - P2, Service Member Interviews, Personalization 2.0 research ([notes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/service-member-interviews/p2_8.14.19_0900.md))

  > M: What did you learn about receiving benefits at VA [during TAP training]?
  > P4: Just a brief overview, they don’t go into a lot of detail on how it works or go talk to a VSO or other organizations. I have looked online but not a lot due to being busy.

### While previous research doesn’t explicitly point to the need for a VA.gov onboarding UX, we identified things that would make an onboarding experience useful.
- Introducing concepts that are unique and specific to VA. There are many opportunities here, but some examples might be:
  - who qualifies as a dependent 
  - what is an overpayment
  - what role can a VSO play in helping a person get benefits
- Making it clear that using VA benefits does not detract or take away benefits from any other Veteran.
  - Multiple studies reference hesitation or shame about using VA benefits because people feel they are undeserving or taking away from others. ([Digital health modernization, insight 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/research-findings.md#insight-2-the-va-ecosystem-is-so-complex-that-veterans-feel-discouraged-to-apply-for-manage-and-maximize-their-benefits), and [Under 40 Trust Score findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/blob/master/research-proposals/VEO/2023-03%20Under%2040%20Trust%20Scores%20Veteran%20Interviews/Under40TrustExecutiveSlides_6.1.23.pdf))
- Surfacing benefit recommendations alongside existing benefit management in a single place.
  - We’ve heard participants positively use the phrase “one-stop shop” when talking about My VA or the health landing page.
  - This also came up in the dependents research last year:
> Veterans are looking for a “one-stop-shop” on VA.gov that would allow them to review, manage, and stay informed on eligibility opportunities….Veterans also wanted more integration across programs to help eliminate redundant information, and so that they could learn about, track, and manage their benefits in a way that aligned with their dependents' life phases, i.e. a life-stages “roadmap.” - Dependents research ([finding 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/dependents/research/2023-09-dependents-research/research-findings.md#key-findings))
- Building trust by being transparent, authoritative, and simplifying complexities.
  - Research suggests the complexity of VA discourages people to maximize their benefits ([Digital Health Modernization research, insight 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/research-findings.md#insight-2-the-va-ecosystem-is-so-complex-that-veterans-feel-discouraged-to-apply-for-manage-and-maximize-their-benefits))
- Helping people understand the sign in process. 
  - Confusion about this process came up in the research we reviewed, and is a frequent topic in research studies. ([Feedback on the sign-in process from participants across many studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity/Research/Identity%20topics%20from%20unrelated%20studies.md))
  - People need to sign in to complete many core benefit tasks; helping reduce friction with this step will likely help people onboard.

### Other VA.gov teams, and the mobile team, haven’t done a lot with an onboarding UX yet.
We reached out to various teams in Slack to see if anyone has explored onboarding.
- The mobile team has 4 screens that serve as a light “onboarding” flow, that primarily serves as a list of things the app does (as opposed to onboarding/teaching about features contextually or helping them get the app set up the best way for them).  The team has a strong hunch most folks pass these screens and there are analytics to support this (link to come).
- The Digital Health Modernization team has not explored any onboarding approach or solutions at this point.
- The check-in team briefly thought about a first time user experience (FTUE), but did not flesh out the idea.
