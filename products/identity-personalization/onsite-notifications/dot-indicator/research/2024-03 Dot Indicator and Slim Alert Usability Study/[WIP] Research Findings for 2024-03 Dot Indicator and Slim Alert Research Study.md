## Research Goals
My VA is now the first destination when a Veteran logs into VA.gov and it is critical that we present the most relevant updates as quickly and clearly as possible on the page. Accomplishing this through the use of indicators, if successful, would fulfill [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) of solidifying the VA.gov platform and enhancing Veterans’ personalized online experiences.

### Veteran Journey
Since Veterans can apply for and manage their benefits any time after getting out of the military, this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond.


<b> 1. Determine the effectiveness of dot and badge indicators to draw attention to important updates and when it's appropriate to use each kind of indicator. </b>
 - Where on VA.gov do users expect to see these types of notifications?
 - What do users think a dot means in different use cases? What about a badge?
 - How do users expect a dot or a badge indicator to disappear?
 - Are there instances where a dot or a badge introduces confusion rather than being useful?

<b> 2. Test with assistive tech users and colorblind participants in order to determine the accessibility implications of the dot or badge indicator. </b>
 - What aria labels would give a screen reader user as close to the same experience as a sighted user? When should aria labels be surfaced in the order of the page?
 - How do screen reader users experience dot and badge indicators as notifications on other websites? What's an ideal experience and what's not ideal?
 - Does colorblindness prevent users from being able to see and interpret a red dot or badge indicator? What colors are most accessible for them to interpret notifications on other websites and apps?

<b> 3. Gain understanding of how slim alert banners embedded in claims cards are interpreted by users in order to assess how we might use/improve them for My VA </b>
-  How do Veterans with experience in filing claims understanding the messaging displayed? 
- What additional information might be valuable for Veterans to see on these banners and cards?
