## Overview

The badge indicator is a notification style that aims to call a Veteran's attention to priority items within their account. The MVP implementation aims to draw Veterans' attention to unread messages within their MyHealtheVet (MHV) inbox from the My VA dashboard.

## Problem statement

- As a VA.gov user, I want to be able to easily see that there are items that require my attention, as well as how many items require my attention or action when I log into the website, and specifically in this case when I visit the Health Care section on My VA.

## User Outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Users will more easily be able to find items that need their attention and know how many items require their attention.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- Done wrong, the badge indicator could be missed by users.

## Business Outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- The badge indicator is simple and easily scalable as an attention mechanism.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- The badge indicator becomes overly or improperly used
