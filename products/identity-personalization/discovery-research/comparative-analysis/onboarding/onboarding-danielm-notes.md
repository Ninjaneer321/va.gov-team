I found links to my onboarding tickets for VA.gov stuff, which might be an interesting comparison.  I was also thinking my kid's kindergarden onboarding/orientation materials might be helpful too? If I can find any of those i'll try to add pictures later :). Haven't run into any other kinda relevant onboarding situations irl yet, other than maybe some video game tutorials... I'll jot notes or links here if I stumble across anythinng else!
