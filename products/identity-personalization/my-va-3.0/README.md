## Overview

When Veterans log into VA.gov, [they expect to be met with an experience that reflects their personal circumstances at the VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-want-a-page-that-is-focused-on-current-information-specific-to-them-rather-than-generalized-information-for-all-veterans). My VA aims to surface actionable Veteran business. 

Our goal with 3.0 is to redesign the logged-in landing page to be action-oriented and notifications-driven, enabling Veterans to quickly understand what needs attention and take relevant next steps.

## Problem Statement
Veterans currently land on a MyVA page that is not optimized for immediate action or visibility into time-sensitive updates. The experience for some sections is static, and Veterans often miss important information or fail to complete important service workflows because these tasks are not highlighted prominently. 

How might we reimagine the logged-in landing experience to surface timely, relevant, and personalized actions so that Veterans can confidently manage their benefits and services? 
- To start, we plan to remove much of the static links and content that have built up over time.
- We intend to[ use new components from the design patterns team that emphasize actions](https://www.figma.com/design/UOx5GSKdZW9GVAjy7078hT/AE-Design-Patterns---Critical-Action?node-id=2-129)


## User Outcomes 

### Desired 
- Veterans are able to see what needs their attention right away (e.g., unread messages, pending document uploads, upcoming appointments).
- Veterans can take quick action on priority items navigating quickly to the relevant onsite experience.
- Veterans feel informed and in control of their benefits and services.

### Undesired 
- Veterans feel overwhelmed by too many notifications or unclear action prompts.
- Veterans overlook important items due to poor prioritization or information hierarchy.
- Veterans encounter irrelevant or redundant alerts that lead to frustration or distrust.

## Business Outcomes 

### Desired
- Increase in completion rates for key workflows (e.g., uploading documents, attending appointments).
- Reduction in call center volume due to improved self-service.
- Improved Veteran trust and satisfaction with VA.gov as a digital platform.

### Undesired 
- Increase in support requests due to unclear new design.
- Drop-off in usage if the redesigned experience feels cluttered or intrusive.
- Misalignment with existing systems of record or internal data infrastructure.
