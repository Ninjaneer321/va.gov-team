# Content decision log - Push notifications
While the content needs for push notifications project was small, I used this opportunity to review the end-to-end experience for Veterans when (1) initially being asked to turn on notifications and (2) subsequent encounters with push notification capabilities. Below are before and after screenshots of current content I'm updating and screenshots of new screens/content I'm suggesting.

| Before            | After (or net new)         | Explanation        | Decision made by | Date                 |

But it is a screen that appears before a new context-setting screen for push. Therefore, we want a similar content structure for both screens. For both, we also want to bring forward the benefits of enabling these functionalities instead of just asking the user. The updated content speaks to the value Face ID provides: easier sign in. |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |
