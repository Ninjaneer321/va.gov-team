# Content decision log - Push notifications
While the content needs for push notifications project was small, we used this opportunity to review the end-to-end experience for Veterans when (1) initially being asked to turn on notifications and (2) subsequent encounters with push notification capabilities. Below are before and after screenshots of current content we're updating and screenshots of new screens/content we're suggesting.

But it is a screen that appears before a new context-setting screen for push. Therefore, we want a similar content structure for both screens. For both, we also want to bring forward the benefits of enabling these functionalities instead of just asking the user. The updated content speaks to the value Face ID provides: easier sign in. We updated the copy in the second body copy sentence that reminds the user they are in control of this functionality and can change it at any time. |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |

Similar to the Face ID screen, we used the header to communicate the benefit of push (staying updated). We left the benefit vague and use body copy to give more details on the benefits (specific push notifications a Veteran gets). We also chose the phrase "app notifications". "Push notifications" is jargon and we can't be sure a Veteran knows what a "push" means. We used the body copy to explain that these are notifications sent to a device vs. text or email. We also explicitly tell Veterans what pushes they'll get (appointments and messages). As we enable more pushes, this copy will need to be updated. Finally, like with the Face ID screen, we added a sentence explaining that the Veteran can change notifications any time, giving them the power to control this functionality. | Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |

Previously, it included redundant headings and unhelpful copy. After confirming with Accessibility, we decided to remove the subheading and update the body copy to further remind Veterans how these notifications will be received (to their device). We also added an external link that tells Veterans where they can go to manage their email/text notifications. Finally, as part of this work, we worked with VEText team to update the API-pulled copy for the toggles. This copy is now more aligned with VA content style guide. |  Misty Milliron-Grant | 03/12/2024 |
