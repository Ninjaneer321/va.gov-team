# VA Mobile App - Personalized Home Screen: Summary of findings 

UAT interviews were conducted May 9-10, 2024. We spoke to 4 participants (1 Android, 3 iOS).

- 95% of tasks passed (only one participant for one task didn't pass, and it's due to a data issue (not the app)).
- We caught a few little readability/contrast things
- Average loadtime was 2.7 seconds — we didn't see any terrible load times (1-4 seconds, on a mix of wifi & cellular—but no "one bar" situations). 

We feel confident moving forward to evaluative testing with Veterans using the build as-is.
