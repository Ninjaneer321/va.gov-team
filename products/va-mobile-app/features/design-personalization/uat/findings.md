# Home screen persoanlization - UAT - Summary of findings 

UAT interviews are complete as of Fri 5/10: 
- 95% of tasks passed (only one participant for one task didn't pass, and it's due to a data issue (not the app)).
- We caught a few little readability/contrast things
- Average loadtime was 2.7 seconds — we didn't see any terrible load times (1-4 seconds, on a mix of wifi & cellular—but no "one bar" situations). 

We feel confident moving forward to usability testing with the build as-is, and kickoff w Perigean is next week.
