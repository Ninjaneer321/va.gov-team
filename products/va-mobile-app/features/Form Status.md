<h2>Form Status </h2>


<h2>Product Management Product Brief</h2>

Last Udpated: May 2025

<h3>Overview</h3>



<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

There is currently no pattern in the Mobile App that exists for Veterans to be able to see their form or form status in the app.  


<h3>Open Questions</h3>


<h3>Closed Questions</h3>


<h3>Desired Outcomes</h3>

- A Veteran can view their submitted form in the app - Where in the app should this live?
- A Veteran can view the status of their submitted form in the app and status are consistent across all forms
- A Veteran can view the history of all of their submitted form in the app (should this be part of MVP?)
- Need to determine if there will be a weblink for each form that will send the user to the webview where they would be able to do more with the form (like edit it).
- (NOT part of the MVP: A Veteran can edit their form in the app)
- (NOT part of the MVP: A Veteran receives a notification of the status of their form updating)
