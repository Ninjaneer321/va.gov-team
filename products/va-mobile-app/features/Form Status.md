<h2>Form Status </h2>


<h2>Product Management Product Brief</h2>

Last Udpated: May 2025

<h3>**Problem Definition**</h3>


There is currently no pattern in the Mobile App that exists for Veterans to be able to see their form or form status in the app.  

<h3>**Background & History**</h3>


<h3>**Solution & Value**</h3>

Enable Veterans to view their submitted forms and the status of those forms in the app.

<h3>**Opportunity and Impact**</h3>

The Veteran should not need to know they are filling out a form. They need access to a service, and historically filling out a form is the method for getting access to that service. HMW provide access to those services in a mobile forward way? 

<h3>**Definition of Done**</h3>

- A Veteran can view their submitted form in the app - Where in the app should this live?
- A Veteran can view the status of their submitted form in the app and status are consistent across all forms
- A Veteran can view the history of all of their submitted form in the app (should this be part of MVP?)
- Need to determine if there will be a weblink for each form that will send the user to the webview where they would be able to do more with the form (like edit it).
- (NOT part of the MVP: A Veteran can edit their form in the app)
- (NOT part of the MVP: A Veteran receives a notification of the status of their form updating)
