# Value proposition
## Overview

In July 2024, the VA Mobile App team began a discovery phase on improving the app's user onboarding and product adoption. As part of this work, we documented our current end-to-end onboarding experience and performed a gap analysis against industry best practices. One of the main problems we identified was that we weren't communciating anything about the value of the app to Veterans. Instead, we were often just speaking to specific features. 

We believed we had an idea about what the app's value proposition was. But it wasn't documented anywhere. Furthermore, we weren't sure our concept of the app's value aligned with that of Veterans. 

We determined that before any additional changes could be made to the app's onboarding experience, we needed to develop and document the app's value proposition.

## Why VAHB mobile app needs a value prop

The mobile app doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's one part of the larger VA ecosystem. It's one way (out of many) in which Veterans can access and manage their VA health care and benefits. But while the mobile app is a part of a larger whole, it does have unique differentiators.
