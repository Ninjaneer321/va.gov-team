# Value proposition

Third-person version: With the VA: Health and Benefits app, Veterans can manage the VA health care and benefits tasks they do most often—all in one simple app.

Second-person version: Manage the VA health care and benefits tasks you do most often—all in one simple app.


## Background

In July 2024, the VA Mobile App team began a discovery phase on improving the app's user onboarding and product adoption. As part of this work, we documented our current end-to-end onboarding experience and performed a gap analysis against industry best practices. One of the main problems we identified was that we weren't communciating anything about the value of the app to Veterans. Instead, we were often just speaking to specific features. 

We believed we had an idea about what the app's value proposition was. But it wasn't documented anywhere. Furthermore, we weren't sure our concept of the app's value aligned with that of Veterans. 

We determined that before any additional changes could be made to the app's onboarding experience, we needed to develop and document the app's value proposition.

## Why we need a value prop

The mobile app doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's one part of the larger VA ecosystem. It's one way (out of many) in which Veterans can access and manage their VA health care and benefits. But while the mobile app is a part of a larger whole, it does have unique differentiators.


## How we got these versions

_**Gathering Veteran perspectives**_

Over a few weeks, we gathered information on the Veterans' perspective of the app's value. We took key words and phrases from the most recent 9 months of app store reviews as well as research and user interviews that have happened over the last several years and feedback from Veterans during the app's MVP discovery activities. We grouped similar key words and phrases to reveal larger concepts about what Veterans focused most on when talking about the value of the app to them in their lives.

_**Gathering team/stakeholder perspective**_

We also completed a workshop with the purpose of gathering and synthesizing key themes of the mobile app’s value from the perspective of various stakeholders and interested parties. We didn't write the value proposition in this workshop. Instead, we collected diverse perspectives on its value and then grouped similar ideas to reveal themes.

_**Comparing Veteran vs. team perspectives**_

After gathering all these perspectives, we compared our findings and found that our team and Veterans had a similar mental model for the app's value.

 Veterans top key words/themese included:
 1. Everything in one place
 2. Personalized/my stuff
 3. Easy of use, quick, convient, simple
 4. Helps manage care/communicate with providers

Team top themes included:
1. All in one place
2. Focused on what Veterans need/care about (touches on personalization, simplicity)
3. Always in my pocket
4. Features that make things easier (biometric sign in)
5. Accessbility

_**Drafting and getting feedback/approval**_

Next, our team's content designer (Misty Milliron-Grant) drafted multiple value proposition versions. She got feedback on final versions from both the team and Danielle Thierry (CAIA). Once a final value proposition was determined, Misty shared it via DSVA Slack with VA Mobile App POs (Rachel Han, Ryan Thurlwell, and Don McCaughey). Misty also presented the final value

Veterans (our core users base)
can manage the VA health care and benefits (nod to VA omnichannel)
tasks (do a “quick” VA thing vs learning all the VA things)
they do most often (just what’s needed, not everything; personalized)
—all in one simple app. (“all in one place,” a “simple, easy-to-use” experience; another nod to VA omnichannel)
