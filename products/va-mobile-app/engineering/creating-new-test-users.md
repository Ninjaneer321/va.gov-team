# [WIP] Creating new test users

## ID.me

Within the staging environment you should be able to go through all the prompts of account creation and then verification by entering in pre determined fake data
I dont have any fake data for you but I recommend grabbing:
- real addresses from random places.
- A fake SSN needs to start with 666 or 900-999.

once youâ€™ve made the account you may notice the name and such comes back as something you didnt enter, this is something that idme does on their own. You can then work with MPI (
@Damien DeAntonio)/IAM to get any of the values updated to what you want.
As was stated earlier any other data attributes you need updated you would need to work with those systems to update it. For example if you need a specific MHV state, you need to talk to the MHV team
