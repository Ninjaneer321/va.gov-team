# VA Mobile App: Personalized Home Screen Evaluative Research Plan
January 2024


## Background
The VA Flagship mobile app was [designed to help Veterans who are actively engaged with VA health and benefits services to keep track of their tasks and interactions across VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/product/Product-Outline.md#desired-user-outcomes). 


Quantitative data analysis indicates that users who initially download the app do not actively use the app over time, and [research participants have also reported that they download the app to see if it can help them (but then don’t use it regularly)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/post-launch-discovery/July%202023/Mobile%20App%20Retention/Research%20Findings.md#detailed-findings). 
The VA Flagship mobile app team believes that bringing personalized content to the VA mobile app’s home screen will help new and current app users understand and find value in the app that they aren’t discovering now, help app users keep up with and manage their current interactions across VA, and ultimately help address the dip in retention we’re seeing.

### Project Objectives & Goals 
#### [Flagship Mobile App Strategy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1j0rO2HvDwHDTzunG3judC1HXOiWfGNTXVciLAkurpRw/edit#slide=id.g1e78b87c057_0_159)
- **Vision:** "Each Veteran is connected to the VA services that matter most to them, regardless of device, and without understanding the VA org chart.”
- **Objective 1:** Veterans will use authenticated services that are highly personalized and valuable.
- **Objective 3:** Increase active user base. 

#### [OCTO Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)
- **Goal 6:** Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

#### Veteran Journey
Since Veterans can download the VA Health and Benefits mobile app any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the Veteran journey from Starting Up and beyond.

### Previous User Research
We have not previously conducted concept or usability research focusing on the VA mobile app’s home screen.
- [Desk research & discovery exploring personalization broadly](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization/discovery/readme.md#personalization-2023) was conducted several times from 2021-2023. 
- [VA mobile app user retention discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/post-launch-discovery/July%202023/Mobile%20App%20Retention/Research%20Findings.md#detailed-findings) (the study that uncovered the problem the personalized home screen is attempting to solve) was conducted in 2023.

## Research Goals	
Fulfills issue [#2160 ](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile-60f1a34998bc75000f2a489f/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/2160)

**Primary:** 
* Understand if/how the personalized home screen design impacts participant **comprehension of what the VA mobile app can do** (in general, and for them specifically). ([*project success metric*](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization/product/Personalized_homescreen-Product-Brief-2023.md#metrics))
* Understand if/how the personalized home screen design impacts participant **perception of the app’s current and future value**. ([*project success metric*](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization/product/Personalized_homescreen-Product-Brief-2023.md#metrics))

**Secondary:**
* **Evaluate the usability of the personalized home screen and category screens** using high-level tasks that the participants will be asked to complete and **determine if any significant usability barriers (including app performance) exist** for participants who use the app with assistive technology vs without assistive technology. 
  * Tasks represent a combination of Health and Benefits features. They will be chosen based on the entry points that appear on the user’s personalized home screen (if no entry points appear, we will ask what they expect to be in that section). This could potentially include:

    * How they’d expect to check the status of a disability claim
    * How they’d expect to complete an outstanding health task (refill a prescription, read a new message, check the details of an upcoming appointment)
    * Find a VA location
    * Veteran status card
    * Find out their disability rating
	
**Outside the scope of this study:**
We will not be evaluating the personalized home screen’s impact on task completion (that will be handled using analytics), the impact on the value of the app to users over time, the usability of features that are surfaced on the home screen, or the personalized home screen’s impact on 


### Outcome
This research will help us understand if/how the personalized app home screen design impacts the project’s [qualitative product success metrics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/features/design-personalization/product/Personalized_homescreen-Product-Brief-2023.md#metrics) as well as identify opportunities to improve the usability and design of the personalized home screen in future iterations.

**Success measures:**
1. Veteran comprehension of what the app can do
    a. in general and
    b. for them in their current circumstances.
2. Veterans’ perceived current and future value of the app.


### Research questions
1. What do participants **believe that the VA mobile app *can do*** based on the contents of the personalized home screen?
    a. in general?
    b. for them in their current circumstances?
2. Do participants **find value in the VA mobile app** in its current form based on the contents of the personalized home screen? Do they anticipate finding value in the future?
3. Do participants **understand** what the modules on the home screen are and **find value in the high-level data** being displayed within the modules?
4. Do participants choose to use the home screen as a task starting point, and will they **successfully be able to [accomplish** some tasks/answer some questions] using the mobile app home screen?
5. **Is there a difference between screenreader users and non-screenreader users** in terms of perception of app capabilities, perception of value, and the usability of the personalized home screen?
6. **Do participants experience performance issues/lag** when loading the personalized home screen? If so, do performance issues impact participants’ perception of the app’s capabilities or value?


### Hypothesis
1. Upon seeing the personalized VA mobile app home screen, participants will **demonstrate that they understand** what the VA mobile app can do (help users keep up with and manage interactions across VA).
2. Participants will **be able to imagine and describe how the app will help** them with the tasks they currently use in the app and in their life.
3. Participants will **understand** that the personalized home screen modules contain high-level data from their in-flight tasks, and may describe it as being helpful in keeping up with their tasks.
4. Participants will **choose to use the personalized home screen modules** as a way to quickly answer questions/access in-flight tasks.
5. Screenreader users and non-screenreader users will **experience the same level of usability**, and use of assistive technology will not cause a difference in participant  perceptions of app capabilities or value.
6. Participants **may experience some lag** when the personalized home screen is loading data, but any lag will not affect their perception of the app’s capabilities or value. We believe that some users may choose an alternate way for accessing tasks if the lag is perceived to be too great.

## Methods + Tools  
### Evaluative Study (remote, moderated)

#### Method
* We want to conduct moderated, remote, think-aloud user interviews with usability testing using a pre-release build of the VA mobile app). The interviews will be 60 minutes in length. 
* We will conduct the research in two blocks, for simpler analysis & less researcher context-switching: 
  * Screenreader users scheduled in a block (with a11y ride along support)
  * Non-screenreader users scheduled in a block
* As a part of the screening process, we will have Perigean:
  * Confirm that participants have download Zoom onto their mobile device before the research session.
  * Confirm that participants can log out of & into the app on their own.
  * Help participants get the app build downloaded, installed & confirm that they can log into it successfully..
* During the study session, we will ask participants to open the app build on their mobile device and share their screen with us while completing a series of tasks.


#### Location
Remote sessions via Zoom


#### Research materials
* Conversation guide
* Pre-release build of the VA mobile app
* Research session sign up sheet

	
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit Veteran participants using a lean maximum variation strategy. We'll leverage Perigean's recruiting services to identify and schedule participants.


### Recruitment criteria
Recruit 16 Veterans for a minimum of 12 successfully completed sessions.

* At least 8 participants should be active monthly users of the VA Health and Benefits mobile app.
  * An active monthly user is defined as a Veteran who accesses the app more than 1 time per month in order to review information or do a task.
    * Please do a phone follow-up to confirm the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits Mobile App. 
    * If the participant can describe what the app’s splash screen looks like on their phone screen (even if they don’t know the full name), that should provide enough information to validate if they have the app and schedule the participant for a research session.
* At least 4 participants should actively be using VA health care AND claims and/or appeals
* At least 6 participants should actively be using VA health care
* At least 6 participants should have an active VA claim and/or appeal
* At least 8 participants live in a rural area (seeing potential internet connectivity differences are important to the study)
* At least 6 participants should be screenreader users
  * 3 should be should be advanced screenreader users
  * 3 should be should be beginner screenreader users
* All participants must be willing to do an activity from their mobile device that requires installing a special version of the app and sharing their screen via Zoom.

#### Secondary criteria: 
* 8 participants age 55+

#### Coordination with Perigean
To assess potential participants' experiences with VA benefits or services, please use their answers to the Digital Service at VA User Research Participant Recruiting Screener Questionnaire question “Which VA benefits or services do you have any experience with?".


## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

* Mobile team feedback on research plan: Feb 202
* Finalize research plan (including app build) and submit to Perigean: 
* Date and time of pilot session: 
* Kickoff meeting with Perigean: before recruitment begins, if possible
* Recruitment phase:
* Facilitation of Interviews:
* Analysis and findings: 


### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Sessions will be 30 minutes in length.
* 30 minutes buffer in-between each session
* No more than 4 sessions should be scheduled in one day


### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
