165
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.240
Perigean: and then tap the other blue button. Start testing.

166
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:37.590
Perigean: Great. Okay. Now, the next thing I'm gonna have you do.

167
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.586
Perigean: Do you see how I'm here? This video screen.

168
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.400
P16: See you.

169
00:08:42.675 --> 00:08:52.239
Perigean: What you can do is you can take your finger and you can drag me over so that the drawer closes. Drag me over to the other side or one of the sides, you can just.

170
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:52.670
P16: Okay.

171
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.720

Perigean: Yes, now I'm in the drawer.

173
00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.710
Perigean: Good! That's where I like to be, so I can see your whole screen.

174

P16: Okay. Thank you.

Perigean: alright. So this we have the app installed. This is the right version of it.

177
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.829
Perigean: The next thing that we're gonna do

178
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:16.150
Perigean: is, I'm gonna have you sign in. And before I have you do that, I'm going to pause the recording so that.

179
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.560
P16: Yeah.

180
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.030
Perigean: For privacy.

P16: Check my stuff, too. Can I bring her in to see what I'm doing?

185
00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:28.900
Perigean: Sure!

186
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.510
P16: Okay, just give me one second. Let's see if she's available.

187
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.220
Perigean: Okay.

188
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.849
P16: Leila, are you busy?

189
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.229
P16: Could you come here? This may be interesting to you.

190
00:09:48.013 --> 00:09:50.420
P16: this here. What they're doing is they

191

P16: Okay, she's hearing. She she's listening.

195
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.020
P16: Hello! How are you.

196
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:05.220
Perigean: I'm fine. How are you today.

197
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.243
P16: I'm wonderful. Hi!

198
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:12.569
Perigean: Hi! I'm hiding in a drawer over here so I can see our.

199
00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.760
P16: Okay, full screen.

200
00:10:14.035 --> 00:10:16.509
Perigean: I was like, just put me in the drawer.

201
00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:22.529
Perigean: Okay? So the next thing we're gonna do, I'm set is we're gonna I'm gonna have you log in. So I'm gonna

202
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:32.219
Perigean: resuming the recording. Alright. So now, what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're gonna use.

203
00:10:35.666 --> 00:10:42.300
Perigean: We're all set up and we're gonna have a. We're gonna have some warm up questions before we we use this app.

204
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.360
P16: Okay.

205
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:51.179
Perigean: All right. So Arm said. Do, were you? You were saying before? Do you have the Va health and benefits? Mobile app.

206
00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:53.989
P16: The v. 8 app

207
00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.590
P16: on my ipad that I use.

208
00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.550
Perigean: Ipad or iphone? Yeah.

209
00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.689
P16: I have it on both of them. My wife has it on.

210
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.560
Perigean: Oh, right.

211
00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:02.889
Perigean: Okay.

212
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.369
Perigean: Do you remember how you heard about it?

213
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:14.149
P16: I think we were at the Va. Actually, when they 1st started setting up the my healthy bit.

214
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.270
P16: Is that what you're talking about.

215
00:11:19.565 --> 00:11:21.850
Perigean: The mobile app for the, so that.

216
00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:29.907
P16: No, we don't. No, we don't have the mobile app. How do we fly it into my healthy bit? That's not a mobile app.

217
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.020
Perigean: Got it? The website.

218
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:37.587
P16: Right. We just go in. We just pull up my healthy bit and then sign. In that way we weren't aware of it.

219
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.177
P16: Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I I was.

220
00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.490
Perigean: So can hopefully.

221
00:11:42.183 --> 00:11:43.309
P16: That's mobile.

222
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:44.139
Perigean: You know what.

223
00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.110
P16: Yes.

224
00:11:45.110 --> 00:12:02.149
Perigean: Everybody. Veterans use a lot of different tools to access. The benefits and healthcare. And that's part of what we want to know is whether or not you use it, and we're talking to folks who use the mobile app as well as folks who have not used the mobile app before. So everybody.

225
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.069
Perigean: whether or not you use it. Your your perspective is still valuable.

226
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:15.860
Perigean: Okay, alright. So you were saying that you use my healthy vet, though. Do you?

227
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:21.370
Perigean: Do you know? Do you recall? Do you also use va.gov, or just my healthy vet.

228
00:12:23.847 --> 00:12:34.610
P16: Just my healthy bit. Basically right? Cause if you go into my healthy bit, it's gonna kind of reroute you cause I think they made some a changes to it.

229
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:35.295
Perigean: Hmm!

230
00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.449
P16: And so it always kind of sends you

231
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.910
P16: reroutes you back. So we usually do the my health event.

232
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:50.179
P16: but I know that they changed it, and now it's on the va.gov. I believe.

233
00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.119
Perigean: Got it. Okay, so what are the reasons that you use? My health event.

234
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:11.610
P16: Check my appointments, send messages to my secure messages to my different doctors, pharmacy refill medications about benefits

235
00:13:13.264 --> 00:13:16.945
P16: we use it a lot. We use it a lot.

236
00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:19.350
Perigean: Okay.

237
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.830
Perigean: great, thank you.

238
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:28.590
Perigean: Okay. So for the next part of our conversation. We're gonna use this mobile app that we just installed on your ipad.

239
00:13:29.071 --> 00:13:34.569
Perigean: So right now, what I want you to do is go ahead and do what you would do on the screen.

240
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:39.210
Perigean: So there's some buttons at the bottom. One of them says, Skip on the left.

241
00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:39.970
P16: 10.

242
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.360
Perigean: Bottom left, and one says next, you can choose either one that you want.

243
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:53.479
Perigean: But when you get to a screen that has the letters VA. At the top. It's not gonna have a blue background anymore. Stop and wait for the next instruction. Please.

244
00:13:53.874 --> 00:13:59.400
P16: Talk to the veterans. Crisis line. Now, update available update. Now, skip this update.

245
00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.999
Perigean: Yup. This is the one to stop and to pause it. Perfect.

246
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.720
P16: Okay. So some.

247
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:10.900
Perigean: I'm going to have you do one thing before we explore the screen. Could you scroll back up? Could you tap, skip this update, please.

248
00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.619
Perigean: It's the black button under update now. Great. Okay.

249
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.249
Perigean: Now, alright, we're ready to go. So.

250
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.130
P16: Cool.

251
00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:37.020
Perigean: What I want you to do is for without tapping on anything to to like to don't touch or tap anything. Well, I would like you to scroll up and down to explore this 1st screen, and as you're doing that, I would love for you to think out loud as you go, like, what are what are you thinking about when you're seeing stuff here?

252
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:52.264
P16: We're not seeing that 1st one talking about appointments. One. I do have one. On the 13th it says, I got a claim. Yeah, we have an active claim. That's the the one that they have to say. If you know which one it is.

253
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:58.323
P16: caregivers thing. Oh, okay. And then prescriptions.

254
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:05.900
P16: I just actually went online and sent in a request for some refills. So I think this is great, this, this

255
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:07.490
P16: this is good.

256
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.550
P16: This is this is a 1. Stop shop.

257
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:14.550
Perigean: a 1 stop shop. Okay?

258
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:25.449
P16: That's what I see, you know, instead of going to all these different things, because if I needed to find out, someone has to go to 2 or 3 different screens to get there, and this is doing it all in one stop, and I don't.

259
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:34.219
P16: Worried about closing up and then going to another area, unless it only showed those 3 things that are active.

260
00:15:35.145 --> 00:15:38.778
P16: Those are active things there right?

261
00:15:40.486 --> 00:15:44.220
P16: We don't have everything. Don't have appointments.

262
00:15:45.355 --> 00:15:50.709
P16: This is what's open. This is what's going on right.

263
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:56.007
P16: If you had a message, then it probably would have a message, but you don't have a pending message. Correct

264
00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:02.670
P16: issuing your rating, which is awesome. That's correct. It's showing your monthly amount. That's correct.

265
00:16:03.306 --> 00:16:09.969
P16: I didn't know all that was on. Well, this is new. This is a I think, she said. This is the new mobile app. This is cool.

266
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:16.570
Perigean: This is a new special version that we're we're chatting with veterans about to get feedback on.

267
00:16:16.842 --> 00:16:26.909
P16: I like it. I like it. And so with somebody says, Well, what's your rating? And are you 100? Then he could pull that mobile app. Instead of going through all these 550

268
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:32.620
P16: clicks, he could pull that one mobile app and then show. Yes, see right here, I'm 100% disabled.

269
00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:42.820
P16: This helps me. This is good for me because he's legally blind, and I usually do most of this stuff.

270
00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:51.059
P16: So it speeds up the process for me when I'm trying to find out something for him

271
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.280
P16: when I'm like.

272
00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.120
Perigean: Leela.

273
00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.160
Perigean: Oh, yeah, go ahead. Arm said, sorry.

274
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:55.880
P16: Now do things.

275
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.840
Perigean: Do you use it?

276
00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.640
P16: I got to use my magnifiers to try to read stuff.

277
00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.270
Perigean: Hmm!

278
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:02.190
P16: This is cool.

279
00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:03.130
Perigean: Got it.

280
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:06.515
Perigean: And, Leila, do you do you typically help them?

281
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:09.750
Perigean: like, look at. Look at digital things.

282
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:11.500
P16: Right, yeah.

283
00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.085
Perigean: Okay.

284
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.659
P16: He's. I'm just.

285
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:14.530
Perigean: Curious if this is like.

286
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:15.420
P16: If this is your.

287
00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:16.693
Perigean: Usual way.

288
00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:17.819
P16: He!

289
00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:19.869
Perigean: You know it helps me. Understand?

290
00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:25.479
P16: Right. He has some he has low vision, but he has.

291
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:25.800
Perigean: Right.

292
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:39.640
P16: Products from the blind the, you know, visually impaired to to help him with certain things. Right magnifiers, zoom machine to help him. But with this ipad

293
00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:47.180
P16: he could pull it up close to him, and he's he's able to see it a lot better. Everything on that ipad. The phone.

294
00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.020
Perigean: Got it.

295
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:56.270
P16: Through it, but he would have to blow it up so big. So the ipad is, is like is almost like his phone.

296
00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:56.720
Perigean: Yeah.

297
00:17:57.109 --> 00:18:04.510
P16: Reading where you could read my screen right now. You see where it says, 6, 7, 3, 5, 4.

298
00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:08.562
P16: That's almost how big I got to make it.

299
00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:14.778
P16: I could see a lit. I think they say this a disability rating, you know.

300
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:15.890
Perigean: Wouldn't mind.

301
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:17.740
P16: But anyway, let me let you.

302
00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:26.139
Perigean: Got it. Alright. Okay. So we're gonna scroll back up to the top, and we've made it through. The scrolled through the whole thing. And I wanted to ask

303
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.379
Perigean: what stood out to you 1st on this screen.

304
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:30.560
P16: Again.

305
00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:31.930
Perigean: You can answer if you like.

306
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.837
P16: I'm sorry. Say it one more time.

307
00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.142
Perigean: Good. Answer. Yeah.

308
00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:38.850
P16: Like to you most

309
00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:52.879
P16: that red writing. Yeah. The red writing automatically stood out to me. Because that's telling me. Hey, stop! What's something's going on. Let me take a look at that which is good saying, Hey, if you got an issue or crisis

310
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:58.952
P16: that talk to the crisis veteran line, now that stands out. That's the very 1st thing you see.

311
00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:08.000
P16: So if you're if you're a veteran in crisis, it's in red, which is amazing, because they know to go straight to that red for help.

312
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.329
P16: Yeah, to see activities. And it showed you

313
00:19:12.904 --> 00:19:17.980
P16: activities that are in progress are available. Now, Justin.

314
00:19:18.546 --> 00:19:19.113
Perigean: Yes.

315
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.820
P16: 1st thing is the red, the red, the red.

316
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.449
Perigean: I did. Okay, got it.

317
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.360
P16: That's good.

318
00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:34.010
Perigean: I did want to ask you about that activity section. I wanted to ask you, what you what do you think you can do

319
00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.210
Perigean: with that. With the things in that area.

320
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:47.339
P16: Well, I could see appointments, and I guess it did. Just tell me that appointment. Can we click on that arrow just to see.

321
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:48.389
Perigean: Not yet.

322
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.210
P16: Okay.

323
00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:51.979
Perigean: I wanna, ask you how you think it works 1st before we talk.

324
00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:52.410
P16: And okay.

325
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.129
Perigean: But we will be in the queue soon.

326
00:19:54.130 --> 00:20:00.360
P16: I think, appointments. When you hit that it will show you all the appointments that you got coming up right.

327
00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:07.410
P16: I wasn't allowed to show you once you've already completed. No, I know it's just just for right now, and.

328
00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.400
P16: Klang's.

329
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:22.659
P16: I didn't know. I I can't remember. I had brain lost 2 because I had 2 brain surgeries. I'm not making excuses, not knowing, and then prescriptions. My wife knows what I take. I don't.

330
00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.240
Perigean: Got it.

331
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.989
P16: I think I think it's it's I think it's good. I think, that you know those

332
00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.239
P16: those 3 main things are

333
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:40.250
P16: the 3 main things you probably want to know about, hey? I got appointments coming up. I've got a pending claim, and I've got some prescriptions that need to be filled. So I think those.

334
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.900
Perigean: Read.

335
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.600
P16: Major things.

336
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.229
P16: Those are the 3 main things that need to be in the activity. I agree.

337
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:48.920
Perigean: Got it. Okay.

338
00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:49.969
P16: At the bottom.

339
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.141
P16: I'm just looking through. Yeah, that's just the I'm just looking. We haven't gotten any further.

340
00:20:57.482 --> 00:21:02.709
P16: Let's just tell, yeah, that's just your home screen.

341
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.980
P16: your health, your benefits, and your payments.

342
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.409
P16: trying to see what they were.

343
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:16.620
P16: But yeah, that blue screen it. And it's it's kind of big. Helps me a little bit too

344
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:18.469
P16: easier to get to.

345
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.820
Perigean: Easier to get to. Okay.

346
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:22.509
P16: Easier to get to right.

347
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:30.251
Perigean: Easier to get to those things. Okay, so I wanted to ask, based on. So we've looked up and down the screen a bit. Now,

348
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:31.000
P16: It.

349
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.729
Perigean: Based on what is present here on this screen.

350
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:42.689
Perigean: in a few words or sentences. I want you to describe what it is that you think that this app does for veterans.

351
00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:48.857
P16: When you say this, Ampatoma, like the appointments.

352
00:21:49.360 --> 00:22:01.860
Perigean: This whole app, this whole thing. We right? We've just seen the 1st screen of this app. And I would like to know, based on just on what you've seen, like appointments, claims, all prescriptions, the stuff that we saw below that with you guys.

353
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.679
P16: I believe what my wife said

354
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:09.509
P16: on on that on the blue section. Here activities, active activities.

355
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:16.078
P16: Those are the 3 main things. I think all veterans who may want to go on on their

356
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:17.810
P16: on this app.

357
00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:22.599
P16: and to help them to get to it quicker by having to

358
00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:24.900
P16: login.

359
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:39.710
P16: look down to the area. You want to go liberty work appointment and have to if you got big fingers like me not to hit something below it. And then you got to scroll all the way down to the point, scroll over and

360
00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.570
P16: try to see it. Where is I believe? Here, if I hit appointments. I let Harold.

361
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.040
P16: It'll show you all the appointments.

362
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:51.629
P16: and I guess I guess you'll be able to set up appointment with Sarah, so.

363
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:52.805
Perigean: Hmm,

364
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:58.571
P16: I think it modifies it makes it much simpler for the veteran.

365
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.770
Perigean: Hmm.

366
00:22:59.770 --> 00:23:15.059
P16: Especially with my husband being a visually impaired veteran. It's much simpler, it's it's simplified. It's easy, and it's quick to get to, and they don't have to, you know, jumble around with a bunch of stuff trying to figure it out. So this app

367
00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:24.529
P16: is, gonna be awesome, especially for the blind veterans, you know, and many others that may have other different types of cognitive issues, or whatever.

368
00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:33.950
P16: I think this would be awesome because this simplify, it gets it right to what they need to get to without having to go through a bunch of other

369
00:23:35.954 --> 00:23:40.360
P16: applications to get to these 3 main things. 3 main things absolutely.

370
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.810
Perigean: Got it. Okay.

371
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:43.339
Perigean: thank you for that.

372
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:52.659
Perigean: So now, next, I'm gonna ask you to imagine a series of situations. And I want you to use this app to work through those situations.

373
00:23:52.780 --> 00:24:00.460
Perigean: and when we're doing that, I want you to try to remember, to think aloud as you go, so that I can better understand what steps you're taking and why.

374
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:05.150
Perigean: And if you find anything frustrating or confusing while we're doing that.

375
00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.400
Perigean: please please go ahead and let me know. Share that feedback. Okay?

376
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.529
P16: You want me to like. Oh, okay.

377
00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.110
Perigean: Yeah. Are you ready?

378
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.060
P16: Yes.

379
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:24.710
Perigean: Alright. Okay, so so I'm gonna tell you. The 1st thing I want you to imagine. And then what you're gonna do is.

380
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:31.979
Perigean: use the app to do that and think out loud as you go. So here is the 1st situation to imagine.

381
00:24:33.731 --> 00:24:37.340
Perigean: Imagine that you are out shopping in a store.

382
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.800
Perigean: and you find out the store offers a discount to veterans

383
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.290
Perigean: without doing anything yet.

384
00:24:44.899 --> 00:24:47.679
Perigean: How do you think you might use this app

385
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:49.669
Perigean: to show the store clerk.

386
00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.409
Perigean: You were a veteran.

387
00:24:54.950 --> 00:25:02.650
P16: Under claims. Oh, right there. Oh, disability rating 100. Okay? Yeah. Oh, my goodness, you're good.

388
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.924
P16: It's a United States proof of veteran status.

389
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.030
P16: and you could hit that. I reckon

390
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:20.290
P16: it doesn't live marine cool thing on the front. Alright, that is, can I hit that arrow or not?

391
00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:20.650
Perigean: Yeah.

392
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.190
P16: So.

393
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:31.599
Perigean: Yup, we I think we have. I think we go ahead and do it for yeah. First, st what the way that this is gonna work is, I'm gonna tell you the thing to imagine. And you're gonna tell me what you think you would do.

394
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.719
Perigean: And then, once we write that down.

395
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:42.119
Perigean: Now go ahead and do it. So I think we've got it written down. Please go ahead and do what you think you would do to show the store clerk, that you are a veteran.

396
00:25:42.290 --> 00:26:02.909
P16: Well, 1st of all, going to what she just said logging into this app is showed that I'm 100% disabled. They gotta see my name and everything when I log in and everything. And then right here about me. That's what say about you is safe United States marine core proof of veteran status.

397
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:04.150
Perigean: It.

398
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.880
P16: If I hit that, let's see, it shows my name.

399
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.629
P16: It shows. Oh, it's Leila!

400
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.470
P16: Look where it shows.

401
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.380
P16: Look a bit.

402
00:26:17.685 --> 00:26:21.040
P16: It's held my whole time in the Rain court and everything.

403
00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.020
P16: It's sure going up.

404
00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:25.771
P16: Wow! Your date of birth. Keep going.

405
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:32.760
P16: David Burke, December 3.rd Status to

406
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:46.230
P16: prove your Service and United States uniform service. I think it's possible, because usually we would have to like, they'll say, Well, we don't have any proof, so we have to run home, get this 100 disabled, make a copy.

407
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.360
P16: One back is showing that whereas this app is right there.

408
00:26:51.869 --> 00:26:58.760
P16: you don't have to go worry about packing that piece of paper which is gonna fade in his wallet over the year.

409
00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:00.040
P16: Me

410
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:15.090
P16: cause. That's usually what happens when we go to get this little fishing license thing. We're digging in the wallet. The little letters all faded out. And so this is perfect, because you could just pull up the app, and there it is, right there.

411
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:25.039
P16: and there's the proof. He could pull out his his id showing that that is his birthday, and that's who he is, and and the thing they should know. Also.

412
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.739
P16: This here is a

413
00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:29.629
P16: a government app. This ain't no app.

414
00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.000
Perigean: That it is mate.

415
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.500
P16: Right.

416
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:44.332
P16: That's your proof right? There, that is awesome. That is that I like that. There's your name. Yeah, I got my whole name spellbike.

417
00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:47.770
P16: This is helping me.

418
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:48.920
P16: Wow!

419
00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:50.520
P16: Was awesome.

420
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.259
Perigean: For that.

421
00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:53.359
P16: Okay, so should be able.

422
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.129
Perigean: I got my

423
00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:05.019
Perigean: yeah, you can close this, and we're going to go back to the home screen. And I have a question about claims. If you scroll up so the next tab.

424
00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:05.580
P16: Right.

425
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:10.390
Perigean: Is dealing with claims. So do you have an open claim or appeal right now.

426
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:19.013
P16: Right. We have a pending claim, or what you well, I guess it's considered an appeal dealing with the

427
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.735
P16: caregivers

428
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:23.710
P16: stipend for me.

429
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:25.250
Perigean: Okay.

430
00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:29.749
P16: That's what's been pending, and it's been sitting out there for a couple of years now. So.

431
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.390
Perigean: Couple of years.

432
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.980
P16: Playing. Right? Okay.

433
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:37.600
Perigean: Okay. How often would you say that you check on the status of that.

434
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:44.770
P16: I check. I go in and check the status of that at least, maybe every couple of 3 months.

435
00:28:45.715 --> 00:29:00.450
P16: And I have to go through a long process, and then it has to ask me, you know, are you really who you are? This gotta send me a message and send. Yes, that's who you are, and then I've gotta wait for it to pull up. So I I go through several different

436
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:02.640
P16: processes that get to it.

437
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:14.439
P16: And so if this is what you think it is well, I think it is. This is much easier, and they could tell me what's going on so. Oh, my God!

438
00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.280
Perigean: And got it.

439
00:29:15.777 --> 00:29:22.870
Perigean: Lila, how do you feel about the frequency that and time that you're spending checking on the status of that appeal.

440
00:29:23.601 --> 00:29:33.060
P16: Well, I guess, because of the kind th this particular one they had some of the appeals they sent up to.

441
00:29:33.717 --> 00:29:36.759
P16: Some judge. So it's in some

442
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:40.740
P16: sitting on a docket waiting for the judge to look at it.

443
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:49.190
P16: and they've sent us a couple of responses saying, hey? We know that, you know this claim is still open. We do have it now. It's only.

444
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.910
Perigean: But his.

445
00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:54.809
P16: That's it's on the judge's day. We'll get to it when we get to it. Well, like, I said.

446
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:55.440
Perigean: Got it.

447
00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.060
P16: You know, 2 years going on.

448
00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.040
Perigean: Few years.

449
00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:03.544
P16: So. You know, if it was, probably would have been a, you know, a normal claim.

450
00:30:03.850 --> 00:30:04.540
Perigean: Hmm.

451
00:30:05.055 --> 00:30:18.174
P16: He's never had any issues in the past with with any claims or whatever. But I guess because this one's in appeals out, you know they will talk about going by time and service, too. Right?

452
00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:22.110
P16: That part doesn't know. Yeah. But I I just think you know

453
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.079
P16: I'm I'm open.

454
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:25.980
P16: I guess I'm I'm

455
00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.120
P16: I'm okay. We're not okay with it, you know.

456
00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:30.040
Perigean: The 5.th

457
00:30:30.412 --> 00:30:31.900
P16: So much going on

458
00:30:32.732 --> 00:30:38.789
P16: with these claims, and this the stipend with the caregivers is is something new.

459
00:30:39.672 --> 00:30:50.959
P16: And then you got the cap of June water thing going. You got a lot of stuff going on, you know, so but it has been quite a while on this particular claim. So

460
00:30:51.865 --> 00:30:56.042
P16: just didn't hurry. I'm late. So it's been up before.

461
00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:04.970
P16: I I don't have choice. The government, you know. We we can't. We can't push them. They're gonna get to it when they get to it. So

462
00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:06.210
P16: you know.

463
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:18.160
Perigean: I hear you. I understand. Okay, so the next task that we're going to do has to do with that claims. So I want you to imagine today that you want to check the status of that open appeal.

464
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:21.500
Perigean: It was an appeal without doing anything. Yet

465
00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:25.880
Perigean: how do you expect to check the status of that open appeal.

466
00:31:26.881 --> 00:31:31.459
P16: Very easily. Just go into that, or just go into that app

467
00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:41.189
P16: and go in, open the app, go down to the claims, push one button and not there. I am

468
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:47.750
P16: 2, 2 moves, 2 moves. Vice is probably 20 moves on the previous

469
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:49.790
P16: way that I was doing.

470
00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.810
Perigean: Okay, alright, so you can.

471
00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.069
Perigean: Oh, Armstride, did you want to add something.

472
00:31:55.070 --> 00:32:03.600
P16: No, I'm just gonna say, I'm thinking, just gonna tell her more. It's easier for her to get to find out a status on her claim. Now.

473
00:32:04.330 --> 00:32:09.080
P16: maybe I'd give her an update more of an update, quick, or whatever I don't know.

474
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:14.620
P16: Well, at least I can see what's going on with it. Yeah, we could see that it is still there, active.

475
00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:19.419
Perigean: Got it right. So you expect to tap that and see what's going on at the with.

476
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.432
P16: Yeah. Up. Here.

477
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:27.720
Perigean: Alright. So I want you to go ahead and use the app to check what's going on with that appeal.

478
00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.870
P16: See appeal updated

479
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:36.700
P16: 22. As you're saying, we're in 2 years of it. So that's

480
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.600
P16: it's active. So

481
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.129
P16: it's just sitting there. Yeah, active plane is

482
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:51.820
P16: and appeal. There's another blue load in your appeal. Yeah. Oh, it takes you to some other stuff. Okay.

483
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.419
P16: yeah, this is cool appeal details

484
00:32:55.750 --> 00:33:10.270
P16: up to date. And so June oh, is of June. Yes, up to date, as of today. Yeah, it's up to date. So that's that's awesome. It takes you. That's just status takes you right to it. You don't have to like

485
00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.169
P16: bumfuzzle all around. Can I hit that one.

486
00:33:13.514 --> 00:33:13.859
Perigean: Data.

487
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.020
P16: Can I hit that issue?

488
00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.360
Perigean: Sure.

489
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.480
Perigean: Go ahead!

490
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.519
P16: It just says, Vha issue currently on appeal.

491
00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:28.379
P16: Okay, yeah, I I love it. That's that's awesome. That was a quick

492
00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.680
P16: stanzas.

493
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.340
P16: See it says awaiting appeal is waiting to be seen

494
00:33:35.917 --> 00:33:40.210
P16: sent to a judge. So it's sitting somewhere on somebody's desk, and

495
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:44.830
P16: you know when they get to it they'll get to it, you know, it's been 2 years. So

496
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:45.940
P16: hmm.

497
00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:49.250
P16: yeah, I just sit and wait. So

498
00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.830
P16: never mind, that's awesome. That's the quickest

499
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:56.229
P16: I've ever been able to get to that

500
00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:59.650
P16: cause, like I say, usually what it'll do is have me to

501
00:34:00.288 --> 00:34:04.010
P16: I'll sign into my health event, and then it'll send me.

502
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:08.860
P16: Other direction that I'm they just gotta say, Are you really who you are? This guy? Send me a.

503
00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:09.560
Perigean: Hmm.

504
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:22.274
P16: A message saying, Hey, yeah, this is you put the code in. Then it's rerouting. Then I got to go 2 other steps to get to it. And this is like, I say, 2 hits, and I'm there

505
00:34:22.850 --> 00:34:23.909
P16: right here.

506
00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.889
Perigean: What are you? Pointing at? Armstride.

507
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:35.069
P16: I was pointing at the go to with it, to review.

508
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.769
P16: to review, to review more details about the appeal. But I don't think there's any

509
00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:53.987
P16: anything else. It's it's sitting on a it's sitting on a judges. My, my mom is. I have an elderly little old lady that I take care. She's 84, and she has a buzzer when she wants some, so she's digging her, so I'll have to stow.

510
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.420
Perigean: Okay.

511
00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:57.689
P16: She's a caretaker of a mother, too.

512
00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.590
Perigean: Got it, she'll be.

513
00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:02.119
P16: She's a caretaker for the vehicle. Who's not.

514
00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:05.210
P16: But anyway.

515
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.820
Perigean: All right.

516
00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:07.570
P16: So.

517
00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:12.649
Perigean: So the next. The next thing that I would like for you to do is to go back to the home screen.

518
00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.110
P16: The home frame.

519
00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:16.879
Perigean: Yeah, that 1st screen we were on.

520
00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:17.320
P16: Right, yeah.

521
00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:22.840
Perigean: That's the one Yup, and please scroll up to where you can see the box that says claims

522
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:24.960
Perigean: alright. So that Box

523
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.730
Perigean: says claims and.

524
00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:27.050
P16: Did.

525
00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.289
Perigean: That it says one active

526
00:35:30.401 --> 00:35:36.400
Perigean: what do you? Yeah, what do you think of having that particular piece of information here on the screen.

527
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.909
Perigean: Just the one active. Those words.

528
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:45.619
P16: Just you mean the one active saying that to tell you if I hit anything active in that.

529
00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:48.400
P16: of course I'd look like it just showed

530
00:35:48.809 --> 00:36:00.890
P16: her claims and the status of it that is being which set on, not set on. But that's in front of you. If I had several activities in the claims.

531
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:08.559
P16: I guess they would tell me. Each one of them, when you roll over, say, claim one, claim 2, or claim 3, or whatever.

532
00:36:08.899 --> 00:36:09.240
Perigean: And.

533
00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.780
P16: Go through each claim that you have active.

534
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.680
Perigean: Got it. Do you think that it

535
00:36:14.830 --> 00:36:16.170
Perigean: go ahead? I'm sorry.

536
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.180
P16: I was. Gonna say, I guess if this, if there's a

537
00:36:19.641 --> 00:36:23.260
P16: granted or denial that it won't be there no more

538
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.320
P16: in the act.

539
00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.020
Perigean: It won't be there anymore in the active area. Okay.

540
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:27.780
P16: Right.

541
00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:36.540
Perigean: Okay, so if it's granted or denied it, the the claims box. This is for my note taker. The box won't be there anymore. When you were saying

542
00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:41.470
Perigean: you were describing just a second ago. Being able to see

543
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:47.550
Perigean: different. We like if there was more than one claim, or if there were different statuses, could you.

544
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:48.689
P16: Could you.

545
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:56.580
Perigean: Repeat that part and tell me if you were talking about this, would you see that on this home screen or on the screen we go to when you tap claims.

546
00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.370
P16: Okay on the claims portion. If it had.

547
00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:07.040
P16: Say, like they had for Christmas. I say, if I had 5 claims in, it'll be 5 active, 5 active.

548
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:20.700
P16: And then if I hit the Arrow to go to the claim department, it'll show me the status or show me something on each one's claims like it was showing on that one claim that we have in. It'll show you that.

549
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.020
Perigean: Okay.

550
00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:28.010
P16: Same amount of information for each one of those claims. I think it to show you all of them.

551
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.069
Perigean: Okay, thank you.

552
00:37:31.039 --> 00:37:32.449
Perigean: Follow up question.

553
00:37:33.194 --> 00:37:44.780
Perigean: Is there anything that you think would be helpful to include here on the home screen under claims, in addition to the words one active, or, instead of the word, one active

554
00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.440
Perigean: on on the home screen, specifically.

555
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.800
P16: On this page here

556
00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.930
Perigean: Yeah. Yes.

557
00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:52.790
P16: Claims under claims. What else do I.

558
00:37:54.342 --> 00:37:55.639
P16: If they hit.

559
00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.440
P16: what pending would be the same as active

560
00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.919
P16: Pending would be the same.

561
00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:09.819
P16: Would pending mean that they looked at it, and if they're trying to judge or make a mess

562
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.070
P16: pending.

563
00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:20.049
P16: maybe I'm thinking, pending, I'll tell you that they've that they're working on it, I mean, but actually.

564
00:38:21.046 --> 00:38:25.330
P16: Same same thing, if active means is sitting there

565
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.530
P16: pending means they're

566
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.450
P16: looking at it. If

567
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.960
P16: you you follow what I'm trying to say.

568
00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:39.569
Perigean: I think so. Are you? Are you trying to say that it would have more than just one active? It would tell you.

569
00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:41.069
P16: I mean, you know.

570
00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.849
Perigean: More than that, like pending instead of just active.

571
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:54.009
P16: Right cause. One could be actively as long as this had, or or say, if I had another one in. But it was in front of the board, and they were looking at it.

572
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:54.970
P16: Thank you.

573
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:55.840
Perigean: Oh!

574
00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.649
P16: Takes a long time, and that is pending man pending.

575
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:01.620
Perigean: Right? Oh.

576
00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:07.790
Perigean: okay, so I it sounds like you're describing. That it would tell me if this is right or wrong.

577
00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:09.360
Perigean: a more.

578
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.700
Perigean: a more specific.

579
00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:13.590
Perigean: And what's.

580
00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:14.360
P16: Yeah, what is?

581
00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.100
Perigean: Doing.

582
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:18.139
P16: More of the status, the status, like.

583
00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:18.520
Perigean: Okay.

584
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:31.518
P16: It's in the board they're looking at it at this moment like, and here would came to mind just to share it with when I was in the military, and they you had something

585
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:35.560
P16: in

586
00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.360
P16: in in

587
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:43.750
P16: in front of a board. But you it takes the board weeks to decide whether or not

588
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:47.700
P16: it's good to accept it. Not good to accept it, or whatever

589
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:52.600
P16: it it's although it's active.

590
00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:56.826
P16: it has. I don't know you getting me lost now.

591
00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:03.940
Perigean: i i i think I understand. What you're saying is that there's something more descriptive than active than the word active.

592
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.260
P16: Right.

593
00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:07.820
Perigean: That could be here cause there's a lot of kinds of active. Is that right?

594
00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.289
P16: Right right. There's.

595
00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:10.060
Perigean: Okay. I know.

596
00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:11.539
P16: And not going nowhere.

597
00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:18.710
Perigean: Right right? It would be more specific about what exactly is going on with this active claim.

598
00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:19.640
Perigean: this

599
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:22.719
Perigean: right? It's active. But what's it doing.

600
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:24.320
P16: Yeah, what's it doing?

601
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:29.660
Perigean: Is it doing right now? Okay, thank you. I under, yeah, I absolutely understand what you mean.

602
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.411
Perigean: Okay, so now we have our next tab

603
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.259
Perigean: The next one I want you to imagine

604
00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:40.639
Perigean: is that you have a doctor's appointment, and it's coming up soon.

605
00:40:41.566 --> 00:40:46.929
Perigean: Imagine now, that you would like to double check the time of your appointment.

606
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:53.330
Perigean: With without doing anything. Yet how do you expect that you would check on the time of your appointment?

607
00:40:54.303 --> 00:41:06.169
P16: I go on appointments, and it should tell me what appointment I have. It should take the date and the time, and where your appointment is under appointments.

608
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:18.770
P16: So I will go to appointments. Find, see which one is coming up next. Okay, cause they had weeks where I had 2 or 3 appointments in a week or 2 in one day.

609
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:24.080
P16: I wonder what to say. You got 2 appointments, then, if it's on the same day. Well.

610
00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.349
P16: will this show 2 appointments on the same day.

611
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:30.680
Perigean: Do you think it will?

612
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.559
P16: It should cause the old one does. So I'm gonna imagine if

613
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.950
P16: it it break it down by

614
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.295
P16: that's

615
00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:55.229
P16: closest one to to activation. If you to the appointment time, should I say? And if I need to find out the exact date and time and and with whom and where

616
00:41:55.300 --> 00:42:03.920
P16: it's location is that's the big thing where it's located, that and they need to define more of a location like, put a room number or something.

617
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.810
P16: Lot of time people, just

618
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:14.820
P16: you. You have to try to search for somebody's room until you get to me with with the hospital.

619
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.719
Perigean: Got it.

620
00:42:16.395 --> 00:42:16.900
Perigean: Okay.

621
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:19.750
P16: Elevators, 5th floor, blue elevators.

622
00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.540
P16: 6th floor. Whatever

623
00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:27.460
P16: more, more more of a description of of where

624
00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.909
P16: I think that'd be. Be helpful.

625
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:30.710
Perigean: Okay.

626
00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:36.999
Perigean: okay, so okay, so you think that, do you think that you would tap on this appointments? Blue.

627
00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.280
P16: Yes, yes.

628
00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:40.439
Perigean: Wanted to ask you a related question.

629
00:42:41.191 --> 00:42:46.489
Perigean: Do you think that there are any other ways to check on the appointment? Like? Let's say

630
00:42:47.410 --> 00:42:49.410
Perigean: that the you could. Yeah.

631
00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:50.010
P16: Called in.

632
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:56.039
Perigean: There's any way to. Yeah you could call in. How about do you think there's any other way in this app to do that?

633
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:58.439
P16: In this app.

634
00:42:58.730 --> 00:42:59.500
Perigean: Hmm.

635
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:06.299
P16: In this app, under appointments, claims, and prescriptions are.

636
00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:16.799
Perigean: like, let's suppose I know you said earlier about another one. Like, if I think either you or leila said, if it wasn't active. It wouldn't be there.

637
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.210
P16: Right.

638
00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:18.540
Perigean: Right.

639
00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:19.290
P16: Wouldn't be.

640
00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:23.700
Perigean: Yeah. What if? What if it wasn't? What if that appointment thing wasn't there?

641
00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:25.970
Perigean: How do you think you might

642
00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:27.439
Perigean: check on

643
00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:29.530
Perigean: if you have an appointment or not.

644
00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:37.230
P16: What if if you don't have one? This shouldn't be under the appointment. But I'm trying to think what appointment you would have

645
00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.200
P16: that wouldn't be

646
00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:43.680
P16: could be, each product pretty good on identifying

647
00:43:44.028 --> 00:43:46.659
P16: when your appointments are. But if I have.

648
00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.370
P16: and it's not there.

649
00:43:49.036 --> 00:44:01.170
P16: or I'm thinking that I have an appointment, but it's not there. I could always call up to the Va. And try to get that department where I think my appointment should be.

650
00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:04.290
P16: I think that would be one way I could do it. This call up.

651
00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:04.970
Perigean: Yeah.

652
00:44:05.130 --> 00:44:09.380
P16: And confirm that. Yes, I have an appointment or no. The appointment is the next week

653
00:44:10.443 --> 00:44:11.409
P16: got it.

654
00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:18.749
Perigean: Okay, well, I want you to go ahead. Go ahead and use the app to do what you would do to check what time.

655
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.749
Perigean: That upcoming appointment is that.

656
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:22.360
P16: Bang!

657
00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:25.920
Perigean: Oh, no! We got signed out.

658
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:27.590
P16: Go ahead! Sign back in.

659
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:32.240
Perigean: Has that ever happened? Well, you haven't used the app before right before today.

660
00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:33.530
P16: That's this one.

661
00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:39.690
Perigean: Okay, that's okay. We're gonna go ahead and sign back into it. And I'm gonna pause the recording while you're doing that. Okay.

662
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:46.739
Perigean: alright, okay, so we're back on this 1st screen. So I just wanna ask some gen, some.

663
00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:54.709
Perigean: Here's our wrap up questions. What were your overall thoughts on this app, this va mobile app that we use today on your ipad.

664
00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.009
P16: Think about it.

665
00:44:57.524 --> 00:45:11.649
P16: I think it's gonna make being that they think we've gone through appointments. I could see the appointments, although I agree that it should be showing more than the next 7 days. I think it'd be helpful. I I think something

666
00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.202
P16: in it that

667
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:30.229
P16: makes sense to confirm your appointment at that particular time, cause that when you confirm it, that makes you think about even more to not schedule something on that day, cause you're already.

668
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.860
Perigean: Remove.

669
00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:34.709
P16: Scheduled yourself for the appointment, which I think is good. Also.

670
00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:44.809
P16: hopefully, they're still sending letters out like they do under claims. I think that's outstanding per place for a claim, especially if a person is waiting

671
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:52.690
P16: on a claim that's gonna be beneficial financially, to them. I think that's great prescriptions.

672
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:54.000
P16: A must

673
00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:55.080
P16: a

674
00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.129
P16: cause I've hit. I've hit

675
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:59.950
P16: times whereby

676
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:04.140
P16: I need. I needed to refill

677
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:06.960
P16: now before my wife started doing it all the time.

678
00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:09.760
P16: Oh, I was gone somewhere in

679
00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:11.659
P16: they had to look up

680
00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:17.249
P16: a prescription like when I went to I went to

681
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.280
P16: Let's ship it to Biloxi

682
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:21.960
P16: in.

683
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:30.230
P16: One of the pills I take is a control peel to whatever they call it, but most Va don't don't have it.

684
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:31.790
P16: And

685
00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:37.420
P16: I had ran out while I was there, and there's something that I need to take.

686
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.590
P16: If I don't I'll be in apparel.

687
00:46:41.485 --> 00:46:42.050
P16: Hmm!

688
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:43.869
P16: They were able to

689
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.110
P16: find it

690
00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:51.110
P16: at a cause. Their hospital didn't have it. There, that's a medical center. They had to go all the way to

691
00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:52.600
P16: Pensacola.

692
00:46:53.740 --> 00:47:13.050
P16: To have it and have it ship so I can get what I need it. And and being that it was part of my prescription. They could see it automatically on here. He needs this chair, or whatever it makes it easier for getting your prescriptions to me. It does. You don't have to go through so many different

693
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:22.089
P16: channels in order to find the prescription. Check it, put it in, and everything else. This here it looks like a 1. Stop

694
00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:27.339
P16: place that you could do that now. Why, my mind is stinking on it.

695
00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:32.359
P16: Appointment I didn't see in there. If you needed to

696
00:47:32.730 --> 00:47:37.739
P16: make an appointment. I I can't remember if it was in there where I can make an appointment

697
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:41.060
P16: to see the doctor or send a message.

698
00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:43.710
Perigean: Hmm, would you expect

699
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:46.049
Perigean: to be able to do that?

700
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:53.660
P16: Yes, if if you need to make an appointment cause, there are time that you need to make appointments

701
00:47:53.710 --> 00:48:02.720
P16: with the Va. That they haven't made an appointment like. I hate to make an appointment for for for dental cause. I.

702
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:06.889
P16: Seeing the dentist out in in the community, and that dentist office.

703
00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:07.630
Perigean: Who's.

704
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:09.769
P16: Was no longer available, so

705
00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:12.849
P16: I had to make them through. The Va.

706
00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.590
P16: Got it. I had to make it through the Va. Because the Va.

707
00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:18.530
P16: Had appointed me out

708
00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:20.629
P16: to the civilian

709
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:22.650
P16: people, and when they went.

710
00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.410
P16: Whatever

711
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:30.659
P16: I have to call, or I have sometime you could just do it online under.

712
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:37.845
P16: The old version, we can make an appointment. I I don't know that was under your appointment section or not.

713
00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:39.240
Perigean: Got it

714
00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:40.540
P16: Point in it.

715
00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.139
Perigean: Right but you, but you would like to be able to.

716
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.582
P16: Yes, I would.

717
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:51.570
Perigean: Okay. That I'll put that in the notes. It's not possible to make appointments in the Va. App yet.

718
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:55.159
Perigean: but I think it's something that they that we plan to do in the future.

719
00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:56.210
P16: Okay.

720
00:48:56.897 --> 00:49:05.512
Perigean: A follow up question I have is you? You listed some things that you liked. Was there anything that you disliked about the app that we use today.

721
00:49:06.127 --> 00:49:19.222
P16: No, I think everything was great. i i i was really surprised when I 1st opened this app and like I said, the the red gonna hit you right at the top, you know, if you're going through prices to

722
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:30.210
P16: call now to that that stuck out, and then these are making it easier to go in, cause the other one. I I'm quite sure you you know you got to log in.

723
00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:48.708
P16: Press this button after you log in, and the writing is so small I got big hands in that barrel I could see in order for me to use. I have to use a magnifier and everything else. Here is a little bigger. Where I could almost I could see the the blue way, the blue, and there's 1.

724
00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:49.420
Perigean: The 3.

725
00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:59.280
P16: Blue. I could see it because each one of you have a space in between that makes it easier for me to to go into it, and then when I roll down here and I see

726
00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:09.320
P16: and oh, I love the brink or things in front of the 2, I'm quite sure every person will have their own, and it tells about me, and and by hitting

727
00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:11.961
P16: it it tell I I'm signed out again.

728
00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:17.860
Perigean: That's okay. That's okay. I know 2 times that happened. I'm making note of that. I don't know why.

729
00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:21.120
P16: I won't sign back in. It's not good.

730
00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:26.689
Perigean: Okay, we're all we're we're at the very end of our conversation. But I'd love if you keep talking about

731
00:50:27.148 --> 00:50:31.180
Perigean: things that you liked, if you can remember what the screen had on it.

732
00:50:33.961 --> 00:50:37.820
P16: oh, yeah, about being able to go in. And Dennis showed you.

733
00:50:38.935 --> 00:50:46.259
P16: how long, you were in and everything else and your address, and all that was was good where I could see it, you know.

734
00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:46.870
Perigean: Hmm.

735
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:49.279
P16: Easily see it, and

736
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:54.469
P16: I I think this would be a better ask than the other one. That's my opeb.

737
00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:59.857
Perigean: The other one got it. So so this is a question sort of related to that.

738
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:06.160
Perigean: Do you think that that you know that 1st screen of the of the app that has the blue boxes on it.

739
00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:06.569
P16: And here.

740
00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:07.600
Perigean: Out, you.

741
00:51:07.980 --> 00:51:16.920
Perigean: Your your branch of service, and your disability rating, and all that. Do you think that that 1st screen would be helpful to you in your life or not.

742
00:51:18.660 --> 00:51:24.840
P16: Yes, indeed, I think it will be the first.st It's gonna be easier for me. It's to show people

743
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:26.259
P16: who needs to know

744
00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:27.890
P16: my rating

745
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:37.930
P16: to show me easier my appointments to allow me to get a status on a claim that I may. I mean it. It's

746
00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:42.230
P16: it's an easier app to work with, I believe.

747
00:51:42.808 --> 00:51:47.820
P16: and then at the bottom, where you hey? We never did get into those.

748
00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:54.920
P16: all those at the bottom except benefits. I didn't know all what what was included under health

749
00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:59.390
P16: with the plus sign, or or I can only assume

750
00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:08.529
P16: on those last 2 the pavements and help. But I'm quite sure if they gonna be just as beneficial as the rest. What I've seen

751
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:13.759
P16: and I've seen I've seen a little bit, and I'm I'm highly impressed with it.

752
00:52:14.392 --> 00:52:15.809
Perigean: Well, thank you.

753
00:52:16.106 --> 00:52:26.889
Perigean: So related to the the how you think that this app might help you in your life. I was hoping you could. Could you walk us through a situation in your life right now, where you can imagine using

754
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:30.089
Perigean: that that 1st screen of this app.

755
00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:30.780
P16: To help.

756
00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:34.700
Perigean: You with it, and explain how that 1st screen would help you do the thing.

757
00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:37.438
P16: Well, to begin with.

758
00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:39.480
P16: Nope.

759
00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:45.340
P16: if I'm in a situation on the road, or whatever.

760
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:50.350
P16: if I need to check more appointments, if I need anything really

761
00:52:50.845 --> 00:53:03.910
P16: on the 1st pages doesn't leave room for error most of the time. How can I use it? I could use it if I if I need to prove that I was in the military for a a.

762
00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.160
P16: for a

763
00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:09.469
P16: but they have a a

764
00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:12.580
P16: let me make it limited.

765
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:16.760
P16: I type in for the Blind Reverend

766
00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:24.180
P16: that we're body could get a corn. Government paid X number of dollars, but you had to be just that, and that in a shoulder.

767
00:53:24.690 --> 00:53:44.140
P16: Immediately on that one page. I didn't have to try to go in and find it, to begin with, in the old one. I don't know where it is, and the old. My wife have to do all that today. I'm not gonna deal with all this small writing, and I like how to share. It's it's more.

768
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:53.249
P16: It's easier for me to see. Even although I have still use the the little magnifier, I could still have a better focus on it.

769
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:54.880
P16: But on that page

770
00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:58.180
P16: pack that helped me invite the self.

771
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:00.980
P16: Terrible

772
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:06.010
P16: it it it has. It talks to me, tells me everything. I mean.

773
00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:08.490
P16: I'm I'm

774
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:12.150
P16: you want a particular situation, though. Right.

775
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:17.980
Perigean: Yeah, you started talking about being on the road and checking on an appointment like if you you could.

776
00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:18.430
P16: And it, yeah.

777
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:23.339
Perigean: Chat story as your example. If you wanted to, or you could, just another one would work too.

778
00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:28.889
P16: Well, I was like the one I said about when I was in in Mississippi, and I needed.

779
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:29.480
Perigean: Hmm.

780
00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.720
P16: A particular medication, and.

781
00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.700
Perigean: Oh yes!

782
00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:40.699
P16: Go around and try to find that one. And I've run out here, too, where the Va had to send me to a a

783
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.170
P16: local pharmacy

784
00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:47.049
P16: to give them. They told me they checked out.

785
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.692
P16: IAA wall wall green, not wall green

786
00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.000
P16: One of those

787
00:54:53.580 --> 00:55:05.180
P16: places. They have medication to see if they had the medication where I could go and pick it up from them, and they did. They gave me a 10 day supply, while the V. 8 here tried to get some

788
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:11.560
P16: that's and this is a medicine that if I don't have it. I will be in dire strait.

789
00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.110
Perigean: Right, right.

790
00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:15.489
P16: And and that.

791
00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:16.160
Perigean: Go ahead!

792
00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:20.470
P16: That I think by that app being there, help

793
00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:29.490
P16: in that situation. If I needed to, to to buy a car, or whatever under benefits it to be all leather, to show

794
00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.433
P16: the information that they require.

795
00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.520
P16: Now the only thing it doesn't have on there.

796
00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:39.610
P16: and I guess you have to go through

797
00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.700
P16: Main headquarters. Could this.

798
00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:49.909
P16: like for the different stip phones, or whatever you have to go through the administrative port of them.

799
00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.726
P16: Va healthcare

800
00:55:52.740 --> 00:56:00.660
P16: like here at the Micley debate. It has the hospital. Then it has their another building where we go for

801
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:04.233
P16: putting in for your different

802
00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:06.800
P16: benefits.

803
00:56:07.830 --> 00:56:11.130
P16: They don't have names of numbers where you could do that.

804
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:12.340
Perigean: I see.

805
00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:13.090
P16: Hmm.

806
00:56:14.446 --> 00:56:16.040
Perigean: Excuse me.

807
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:18.436
P16: You excuse me, I'm alright.

808
00:56:19.174 --> 00:56:29.175
Perigean: Sorry cough. With the you were talking about with the. I wanted to ask you one more question about the the this example you're giving about trying to

809
00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:35.549
Perigean: a medication not being some place, could you? Needing to

810
00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:40.799
Perigean: to talk to another nearby place? How would you use the home screen in that situation.

811
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:47.129
P16: I would if I'm at another.

812
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:50.320
P16: Say, if I'm in this hip it like it happened.

813
00:56:50.850 --> 00:56:51.200
Perigean: Yeah.

814
00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.926
P16: The blind veterans the Brc. Is what they call it, and

815
00:56:56.550 --> 00:56:57.950
P16: and I need it

816
00:56:58.210 --> 00:56:59.100
P16: dehuman.

817
00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:06.940
P16: I had to ask my wife's name of the medicine. I need it, but they had to try to find some.

818
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.229
P16: and huh!

819
00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:11.700
P16: They found some like, I say, in Penola, and they.

820
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:12.279
Perigean: Right, sure.

821
00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:14.210
P16: And overnight for me.

822
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:15.260
P16: and.

823
00:57:16.230 --> 00:57:24.999
P16: By looking at this here. If they can look at here they could easily see it. I don't know how they could look it up, but they they know.

824
00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:28.089
P16: Medication I take, but that's not. That's.

825
00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.389
P16: You want you want to?

826
00:57:32.056 --> 00:57:33.830
P16: Oh, sure!

827
00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:39.349
Perigean: That it works. It sounds like, are you saying that you you could. You could use that home screen to to see.

828
00:57:39.350 --> 00:57:40.220
P16: The name.
