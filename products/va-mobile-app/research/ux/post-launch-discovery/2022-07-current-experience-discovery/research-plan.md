# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Gain awareness of the current mobile app experience for Veterans who are monthly active users of the app and evaluate general usability and pain points"
  - goal_2: "Compare Veterans' feedback using the app now to research findings completed before the app's launch in order to update our current understanding of the app's value"
  - goal_3: "Identify Veterans unmet needs and uncover areas where the app could provide future access to other VA health and benefits areas"

research_questions:
  - "How do Veterans rate the current experience using the VA Health and Benefits app? What things do they like about it, and what are the pain points?"

# VA Mobile App Research 


## Discovery: Current Experience

Part 2 Remote


### Q2 2022


# Background


#### In an effort to build continuous research into the mobile app team, we are looking to meet with Veterans who currently use the VA Health and Benefits app in order to understand the specific details of their current experience.


#### This research initiative will focus on uncovering the experience Veterans have using the VA Health and Benefits app. We will build on the insights surfaced in the original discovery research studies conducted prior to the app’s launch, and through this initiative we will seek to uncover new insights in order to help shape the app’s future roadmap.


### **OCTO Objectives**

  </tr>
</table>



#### 
**Measures to increase**



* Completion rate of online transactions
* Usage of digital, self- service tools
* Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)

**Measures to decrease**

* Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
* Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery
* Time to successful complete and submit online transactions


### **Veteran Journey**

Since Veterans can download the VA Health and Benefits mobile app any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the Veteran journey from Starting Up and beyond.


### **Research goals**



1. Gain awareness of the current mobile app experience for Veterans who are monthly active users of the app. Evaluate general usability of the app as well as pain points.
2. Compare Veterans’ feedback using the app now to research findings completed before the app’s launch in order to update our current understanding of the app’s value.
3. Identify Veterans unmet needs and uncover areas where the app could provide future access to other VA health and benefits areas.


### **Outcomes**



* Specific lists of feature areas working well in the app, as well as common pain points.
* Prioritization map of areas to focus on next as new Sprint 0 initiatives in the team’s roadmap
* Evolved understanding of the value the app provides based on user feedback explaining motivations for using the app compared to accessing other digital tools in the VA ecosystem.


### **Research questions**



1. How do Veterans rate the current experience using the VA Health and Benefits app? What things do they like about it, and what are the pain points?
2. What main reasons do Veterans mention for using the app?
3. What types of things do they prioritize using the app for?
4. What types of things do they want to see in the app in the future?
5. How do Veterans describe their digital trust level with the app?


### **Hypothesis**

Veterans who currently use the VA Health and Benefits mobile app use it for quick, transactional tasks, but there are other things Veterans want to be able to use the app to do that they can’t do right now, such as finding out about benefits they might be missing out on.

### **Methodology**

This is a moderated, remote study to supplement the first study completed in-person on July 21 and July 22, 2022.

Sessions will take place online.



### Recruitment approach

We will recruit Veteran participants using a lean maximum variation strategy. We'll leverage Perigean's recruiting services to identify and schedule participants.


### Recruitment criteria

Recruit 10 Veterans for a minimum of 6 successfully completed sessions.


### Primary Criteria

Veterans who are active monthly users of the VA Health and Benefits mobile app. (Active monthly users is defined as a Veteran who accesses the app more than 1 time per month in order to review information or do a task.)

Please do a phone follow-up to confirm the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits Mobile App.  Once downloaded, the app looks like this:
![VA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79866060/181546254-135661e0-7546-4060-bb13-a1426490f887.png)




If the participant can describe what the app looks like on their phone screen (even if they don’t know the full name), that should provide enough information to validate if they have the app and schedule the participant for a research session.


### Secondary Criteria


### Inclusion



* 7 participants who identify other than white
* 3 participants who use assistive technology (e.g. screen reader, magnification) - Please check with them prior to scheduling to confirm they understood this requirement correctly and do use assistive technology
* 3 participants who identify as other than straight/heterosexual and cisgender
* 5 participants age 55+
* 5 participants who identify as having a cognitive disability
* 5 participants who do not have a college degree
* 2 participants who identify as women


### Timeline

Sessions will occur on Thursday August 4th, Friday August 5th, Monday August 8th and Tuesday August 9th between 9am and 4pm EST.


### Pilot 

The Pilot session will be held on Wednesday August 3rd, 2022


### Sessions

Sessions will be 60 minutes in length. 

No more than 4 sessions should be scheduled in one day, with 30 minutes buffer in-between each session.
