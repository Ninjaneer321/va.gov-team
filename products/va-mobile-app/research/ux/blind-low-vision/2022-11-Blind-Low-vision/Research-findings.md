# Research Goals
Identify pain points for Veterans using assistive tech navigating the app.
Surface new accessibility issues. 
Establish foundational knowledge of patterns and differences in experience across a   diversity of mobile assistive technology users.
What value does the mobile app provide blind users versus other products in the VA ecosystem?


# Research Questions

1. Are participants able to successfully navigate to key tasks in the app using assistive technology (keyboard, voice, and zoom/magnifier)?
  a. Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle with finding and where do participants expect to find those tasks?
  b. Which tasks, if any, do participants struggle completing? Where do they get stuck? 
2. What, if anything, would participants want to change about the app?
3. What, if anything, are people expressing positive reactions to? How are they reacting?
4. Does the app have room for improvement with these tools and other tools that we may not consider during testing?  Is there anything that would be a deal breaker?
5. How is the content language translating to the Veteran? 
  a. Is it inclusive?
  b. Does it have anything misleading?
6. If the app is having login issues (or other issues), does the Veteran find a workaround? If so, what is it?

# Methodology 
We conducted **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants were asked a few questions about their experiences with VA benefits, and then were given tasks as wayfinding prompts to explore the VA Mobile App.
Study tasks
Participants were asked to complete the series of tasks listed below.  This includes:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Task</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Location</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Review your military information
   </td>
   <td>Profile
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Review a past claim to find the details of what you’ve claimed 
   </td>
   <td>Claims
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Find your proof of service card
   </td>
   <td>Letter (end at review letter)
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Compose a message
   </td>
   <td>Secure Messaging
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>







# Hypotheses and Conclusions

## Hypothesis



1. Participants will be able to easily complete tasks that involve clicking through 3 or less screens such as reviewing their military information. 
2. Participants will encounter usability hurdles with more complex forms/flows such as composing a message.
3. Participants will find the PDF of their letters inaccessible.




## Key Findings
<br>


1. Veterans using assistive technology navigated through the app fairly well, although new issues surfaced — and the experience wasn’t always smooth.
2. The challenge of the in-between became clear. Veterans progressing in their VA journey or with in-flux or blurry health situations seemed to face additional pain points.
3. Veterans using assistive technology value independence, and the tools they use to realize their independence are critical.
4. Veterans using screen readers used shortcuts when navigating the app.


### Details of Findings
<br>

#### Key finding #1: 

Veterans using assistive technology navigated through the app fairly well, although new issues surfaced — and the experience wasn’t always smooth.



1. Participants expected a back button on the category screens when referred there from a card on home.
2. Three participants who navigated to screens in the Health Care & Claims areas by initially tapping a card on the home screen (instead of navigating via the tab bar) later expected to find a back button allowing them to return home on those category screens when they were retracing their steps.
3. Color contrast and lack of color differentiation made certain screens unreadable for some participants.

Some of these accessibility issues included:



1. Alert notifications are currently being skipped by screen readers.
2. System timeouts are occurring for some users. We believe this is based on data limitations and/or connectivity issues.
3. Pinch to zoom is currently not available in the app. Many of our low vision participants pointed this out as a major issue.
4. When using TalkBack, some of our participants have to toggle it on and off due to connectivity issues. As a result, provider lists in secure messaging were also appearing and disappearing for the participants.


#### Key finding #2: 

The challenge of the in-between became clear. Veterans progressing in their VA journey or with in-flux or blurry health situations seemed to face additional pain points. We started to see a theme of veterans who straddled the in-between of being fully blind and relying on tools like screen readers and braille and other veterans who were still able to see in some capacity. This in-between stage makes it difficult for veterans who might be needing to transition to a screen reader full-time, but are not entirely familiar or comfortable with such tools yet. 

We also saw a start difference in support from the VA.



* One participant was legally blind, but the VA did not recognize her as being blind. As a result, she receives little to no support for her vision issues from VA.
* On the other hand, another participant was recognized as being legally blind by VA and received an abundance of support including: blind rehabilitation, devices, and assistance from the BROS (Blind Rehab Occupational Specialists) and VIST (Visual Impairment Services Team)

The app was more difficult to use and navigate for veterans with low vision. Participants experienced issues with logging in, reading the screen, not being able to see color variation, provider lists appearing and disappearing when screen reader was turned off and back on, etc. We witnessed low vision participants use workarounds like flipping back and forth between landscape and portrait to read text and navigate. One Veteran struggled with anything black or white but color on color would work, while another veteran required more color variation in list items. One veteran would attempt to utilize pinch to zoom functionality that is currently unavailable in the app. 


#### Key finding #3: 

Veterans using assistive technology value independence, and the tools they use to realize their independence are critical."I don't mind asking for help, but if I could independently go to the hospital, and if I can go into that door and touch a tile and just say, hey, you’re on the first floor. I would love to see that." Participant 4

A popular tool that was mentioned was the Be My Eyes app, which allows a non-sighted person to ask a sighted person for assistance with something that they need to visually see.  \



#### Key finding #4: 

Veterans using screen readers used shortcuts when navigating the app.

When navigating the mobile app, we noticed that sometimes the screen reader would appear to skip items that were at the top of the screen. It was later confirmed by two expert screen reader participants that they will often start navigating a screen by tapping lower down on the screen. This is often an attempt to skip over elements that are redundant.

Shortcut examples:



* Starting lower on the screen when navigating to a new area 
* Tapping on areas of the screen where they would expect to find something.


### Additional Findings
<br>


1. No braille on the walls at the local VAMC – needs to ask a family member to go along
2. Different systems at different VAMC locations within the same state - Veteran needed to be the go-between to get access to records and tell them which systems to use
3. Patient advocates not always helpful

**Motivations for getting the app:**



* Neurologist recommended it to help keep track of things 
* Locate VA facilities near me for mental health services
* Review claims
* Send secure messages
* See all the benefits I’m eligible for
* Renew my expired Veteran ID

**Ideas from participants:**


* Find areas in the app where functional and easily interpreted icons can provide a visual cue in tandem with a label.
* Get training on the app 
* Provide a way to leave feedback in the app
* Combine things: MOVE, PTSD, Rx – participants would like everything in one app


### Team Learnings: Running AT Research
<br>
**Be flexible**



* Tech problems: used talk aloud method when we couldn’t hear screen readers
* Veteran Login problems - got a Veteran on test flight to review a demo version of the app when they couldn’t get into their app

**Bring the whole cross-functional team along**



* Engineering came to the pilot session!
* Team members from product, design, engineering, and accessibility specialists attended research sessions
* Group synthesis following all sessions

**Accessibility experts lead**

* We focused on accessibility from the very beginning of planning this research study and had either one or two accessibility specialists on our calls, and had them help flesh out our research plan.  Any questions that came up about AT logistics or how to run the study, we deferred to them.
* During sessions, we had an accessibility specialist and accessibility tech support person to help with screen reader hurdles. 
* We held debriefs after each session, again with an accessibility specialist to chat through any issues or fill us in on something that might have come up that we were unfamiliar with, for example what a Merlin desktop document reader is etc. 
* During note taking we had A11y specific note takers coding their notes with an A11y label, along with general note takers. When it came to synthesis, we had an A11y specific group and a general synthesis group so that they could really focus on A11y findings, insights, bugs etc. 



### Recommendations:

**UX Issues to Address:**



1. Action items higher up on the screen (compose a message)
2. Login issues
    1. Error messaging (i.e. DS Logon issue)
    2. Security question copy is cut off in portrait mode
3. Screen reader skips alert notifications
4. Ensure biometric components are working properly
5. Better color differentiation
6. Explore solutions for TalkBack issues 
7. Back button inconsistencies
8. Custom picker was expected to close after making selection instead of selecting done. 


### Future Ideas



1. Could the app provide a way to show a minimal version? (either a setting or asking in-real-time if they want to view a "minimal" version when internet service is slow or “spotty”).
2. Use of icons - helpful for Veterans who are not native English speakers, have cognitive disabilities, or low vision users
3. Make the tech difficulties easier on Veterans: if assistive technology users prefer meeting in person, how might we set up in person feedback sessions?
4. Integrate training on the app at blind rehab centers: early discussions with Tim Hornak at BVA
5. Using an accessibility-first approach for new feature builds
    1. Reach out to accessibility experts early on to drive research questions and strategy
