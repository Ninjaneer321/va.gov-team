# Research Plan for Mobile App User Testing

January 19, 2021

## What product & team?
VA Mobile App

## Goals
The VA Mobile App team is conducting testing to understand usability obstacles, ask questions, and get feedback from Veterans on an MVP mobile app we are developing. The outcome of this testing will inform any necessary immediate adjustments and also potential future improvements. 

### Background
The VA Mobile App team has designed and built a MVP mobile app. We would like to test this app with users to answer the following questions:

**Sign In**
- What usability obstacles exist with the sign in flow?
- Are participants able to successfuly sign in and return to the app?
- If not, what barriers prevent them from doing so?
- What usability obstacles exist with our app's sign in screens (biometrics opt in, homescreen, loading screens)?
  
**Features**
- At a high level, what usability obstacles exist in navigating around Profile, Claims, and Appointments? 
- (If the participant has Profile data) What questions do users have about Profile?
  - What do participants find confusing/unclear?
  - Does anything feel like it's missing?
- (If the participant has appointments data) What questions do users have about Appointments?
  - What do participants find confusing/unclear?
  - Does anything feel like it's missing?
- (If the participant has claims & appeals data) What questions do users have about Claims or Appeals?
  - What do participants find confusing/unclear?
  - Does anything feel like it's missing?
  
**Usefulness**
- Do participants describe finding the app useful, and if so, why?
- If participants could add 1 thing to the app, what would it be? Why?

## Method 
#### What method of research are you planning?
- Remote, 60-minute user interviews with 10 Veterans. We’d like to recruit 12 people, and hope we are able to successfully complete at least 6 sessions.
- Each of these interviews will be moderated and conducted remotely via Zoom’s app on the Veteran’s mobile device.  

#### Why this method?
Conducting via Zoom is the only option at the moment. 

#### Where are you planning to do your research?
We will use the Perigean zoom account. 

#### What will you be testing?
- We will be testing a live code prototype of a mobile app.
- We will be asking Veterans to sign into the app using their own MHV, DS Logon, or ID.me credentials. Participants must be LOA3.
- We would like Perigean's help testing that participants can sign in successfully to VA.gov prior to sessions.
- The mobile app will be unpublished at the time we test it, so participants will need to download an APK file onto their Android mobile device to access the application. We will walk participants through this process at the beginning of the session. 



## Participants and Recruitment

Participant criteria: 

- Important: All participants should have an **Android** mobile device be able to join the session on this device.
- All participants must be Veterans
- All participants must have an active DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me account
- All participants must be Level of Assurance (LOA) 3
- All participants must have signed into VA.gov within the last 9 months 
- All participants must have VA healthcare appointments
- All participants must have an active claim or appeal
- At least 1 person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least 1 person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least 1 participant who uses assistive technology _(nice to have)_ 
- At least 1 person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
- Participant pool should be diverse in:
  - Branch of service
  - Gender (30% or more women)
  - Race
  - Age (At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55)

## What is your recruitment strategy?
- Perigean will recruit
- Perigean will confirm participants have LOA3 credentials prior to sessions
- In order to get at least 6 successful sessions (participants show up and are able to successfully sign in and participate), we would like Perigean to schedule 12 participants total, with the expectation we will have at least a 50% success rate overall. 

## When?
1. Timeline for this study: February 1-5, 2021.
2. Length of Sessions: 1 hour
3. Availability: 
  - Monday, 2/1: 9 AM CT – 6 PM CT 
  - Tuesday, 2/2 9 AM CT - 1 PM CT; 4 PM CT - 6 PM CT
