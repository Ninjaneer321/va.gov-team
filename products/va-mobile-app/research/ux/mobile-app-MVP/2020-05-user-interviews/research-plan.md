# Research Plan for Mobile App Discovery

April 24, 2020

## What product & team?

Team Hummingbird

## Background

Today, nearly 40% of all users access VA.gov on a mobile or tablet device. The VA also offers a VA App store that has over 40 apps. We are interested in better understanding why and how Veterans choose the ways that they interact with VA using mobile technology. What gaps exist in VA's Veteran facing technology that would be best addressed by a "flagship" VA mobile app? 

## Research questions

- What are all the ways Veterans manage their VA benefits (web sites, mobile apps, phone, in-person visits, VSO, etc.)?
- - What benefits or services are Veterans accessing (e.g. education, healthcare, disability)?
- How do Veterans currently use their mobile devices?
- - What non-VA apps (non-social media apps) do they use the most? Why? 
- Do Veterans currently use their mobile devices for managing VA benefits? 
- - If a Veteran uses existing VA mobile apps, what has their experience been?
  - If a Veteran uses VA.gov on mobile, what has their experience been?
  - Do Veterans feel strongly about certain tasks being better for mobile or better for desktop for them? Why?
- Where can a mobile app add unique value to VA’s technology offering (VA.gov et al)?
- What is the “critical mass” of capabilities that Veterans would find compelling enough for an app to feel worthwhile to download?
  - What will make Veterans say “this is a great start”?
  - Refer back to Veteran’s experience with VA (benefits they access) and ask what pain points exist for them there? Do they think a mobile app could help?


## Hypothesis

Veterans are interested in using a mobile app to manage some aspects of their VA benefits, and an authenticated app with personalization may add value to VA.gov. 


## Method 

### What method of research are you planning?

Remote, 60-minute user interviews with 8–10 of Veterans over the course of two weeks. Each of these interviews will be moderated and conducted remotely. The sessions will include background questions, targeted and open ended questions about their experience with VA.

### Why this method?

This method will allow all members of the Hummingbird team to observe sessions, allow us to speak with a diverse population of Veterans located across the United States, and allow us to ask open ended questions and observe how the Veterans respond in real time, letting the interview unfold naturally based on the individual’s circumstances. 

### Where we are planning to do our research

We will use the Perigean zoom account. We may share our screen and guide participants through more high-level stimuli.

### What we are testing

Remote, mostly conversational sessions with Veterans. If warranted by the conversation we might look at particular sites or apps via screen share or camera share.

### Participants and Recruitment

We would like to interview 8-10 Veterans for this generative research project. Participant criteria: 
- All participants must be Veterans
- Participant pool should be diverse in:
  - Branch of service
  - Gender (30% or more women)
  - Race
  - Age (at least two people from 18-30, 31-50, and 50+)
  - Geography
  - Density (rural)
- Should be majority mobile device users 
- Diversity of experience with VA benefits and services, but definitely some participants with experience with one of these three: 
  - Education & career services
  - Disability benefits
  - Health care benefits
- At least 1 assistive device user (nice to have)

If possible, we would like to add the following question as an open text field question to the recruitment screener (nice to have)
- How would you describe your mobile device usage?

## Recruitment strategy

1. Perigean will recruit
2. In order to get 8-10 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 15 participants total, with the expectation that there be a max of 7 no-shows.


### When

1. Timeline for this study: Monday, May 4 – Friday, May 15 (depending on recruitment)
2. Length of Sessions: 45–60 minutes (we'd like to schedule for an hour, but we anticipate sessions taking ~45 minutes)
3. Availability: Monday – Wednesday (11 AM EST – 6 PM EST). Please don’t schedule back to back sessions.
4. Prepare: We will conduct a pilot interview on April 30 or May 1.
