# VAHB Mobile App Homescreen Preliminary Research Plan

_February 24, 2026_

---

## Background 📁

VAHB Mobile App is planning changes to the homescreen to make better use of the limited real estate of the homescreen to meet users' needs to:

1. Quickly find and understand relevant information on the homescreen
2. To complete key tasks and actions in the app as needed

The team seeks to understand whether current homescreen concepts align with Veterans' expectations and priorities and successfully helps them complete needed actions.

## Research Goals 🎯

### Goals

1. Understand users' expectations for homescreen content, features, and behavior
2. Understand how Veterans interpret and use the homescreen content

### Outcome

We plan to incorporate insights to guide design decisions for homescreen and related actions so that we design based on Veterans' input.

## Research Questions: For Further Discussion, Prioritization, and Refinement with Team

1. **Feature access:** How do users expect to access frequent user actions i.e., on the homescreen or accessible from homescreen:
   a. Veteran status card
   b. disability rating paired with payments
   c. Veteran health ID card?
2. **Level of information scent needed:** What amount and type of data do users expect on the homescreen for what is currently called the snapshot e.g., "2 Rx refills ready" vs. "2 Rx refills ready for xyz and abc medications"?
3. **How do users respond**, and what actions do they take if any, after viewing homescreen:
   a. global alerts
   b. user alerts
   c. new items
4. **What existing content or features do users not want** on the homescreen?
5. **After starting a task** from email notification and homescreen, how do users handle interruptions or distractions from app content when they're mid-task?

## Hypotheses - TBD

## Methodology 🔬

We will conduct moderated usability testing with Veteran app users. We will design tasks for users to complete using clickable low-fi wireframes to assess how users interact with the current homescreen and related tasks designs.

### Location

Remote

### Recruitment 🎯 - Exact criteria TBD depending on tasks to be tested

- Likely aim for recruit 12, seat 9
- Split of Android and iPhone users; Android tablet and iPad users
- Include users of the app
