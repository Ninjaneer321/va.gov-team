- "1. this app notified me that a past VA appointment was too far from my home AND it allowed me to apply for reimbursement of miles 2. it also shows my future appointments which is a great reminder 3. it allowed me to see a VA letter for a claim decision they had made that day (no need to wait 14 days for USPS letter). I wish I was able to file claims but maybe in the future"

## Negative

| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|---|---|---|
| = 1 | 13.9% | 46 |
| = 2 | 4.5% | 15 |
| **Total negative (1+2)** | **18.4%** | **61** |

**Summary:**
Negative responses trended around issues with signing into the app, a lack of functionality or content that users expected and wanted such as making appointments and appointment details, and problems finding features such as travel pay to file claims.

**Representative responses:**

- "This is app fail to log in, fail to recognize ID me log in and my VA log in passwords. Always logs you and forgets information and then will not recognize you when trying to log back in. Contacting the help desk just results in excuses and the usual government It is better to just use a browser to log in because improvements just keep a once useful app worse."
- "This app is misleading. it makes it seem like you can handle all of your VA needs but all it does is let you look at your information and view appointments you have already made using the website. I looked for quite some time and could not seem to find a way to click and make a new appointment. I dont know why I had any expectations to the contrary, its a non profitable piece of programming made to help people nobody really cares about navigate a difficult, unforgiving system. dont fall for it."

## Neutral

| Rating | % of ratings | # of ratings |
|---|---|---|
| = 3 | 6.6% | 22 |

**Summary:**
Neutral feedback is mixed with users expressing that the app is generally a good foundation but could use some improvements to stability and key tasks to be something users can rely on and want to use versus the VA website. Users find the app usable enough but echo some of the negative feedback in wanting more information on appointments such as purpose of visit and provider name, having recurring issues with signing in, and navigation issues.

**Representative responses:**

- "functional but not great. doesnt tell you who your appointments are with. will tell u time and location most of the time but not what its for. super frustrating especially when it could be for a procedure you need a driver for. this needs to be fixed. other than that the app works pretty well."
- "The VA app is a great start to a supplement to the VA.gov website. Please work on making the menu system more intuitive for users. Add the ability to view entire secure messages instead of partial messages. Great start, keep involving. ~[Name]"
- "Is it just me or is anyone else having issues logging into app? I set up ID Me years ago and this app has been perfect till sometime in December, when I hit sign in takes me to website and then top half is just blue and white then blank. Still see all links at bottom of page though."

## Common Themes for Issues

### 1. Login issues cause friction and frustration (~29 reviews)

Users experienced difficulty getting into the app with issues such as looping back to login, failed identity verification, and slow and redundant steps.

**Representative responses:**

- "great app but why the gymnastics to login? i forget what I am doing by the time I am able to open the app."
- "verified phone number through text code and email, ssn, address, and ID, then tried to reverify phone number to complete and FAILED. Really? wow, just wow."

**Pain point:** As a Veteran, I want to login quickly and reliably to the mobile app, but I am blocked by login and authentication issues.

**Recommendation:**
Investigate and stabilize the login flow through a combination of 1. user research to drill down into what users are experiencing and 2. technical investigation to identify when technical issues vs UX or user error issues are presenting.

### 2. Missing or incorrect information in appointments and records causes confusion (~14 reviews)

To avoid frustration and confusion, Veterans expect and want:

- Additional details about appointments including purpose of visit, provider name, clinic specifics, room number, type of treatment, and accurate current information about providers available (8)
- Accurate and current lab/test results in the app (3)
- Accurate and up-to-date payment information (4)

**Representative responses:**

- "The app is very good. My only criticism would be in the appointment section does not say what clinic your appointment is in or the doctor the appointment is with, only gives the facilities address. Adding the clinic name would help tremendously! The new travel voucher feature seems to be very streamlined and was a welcome surprise."
- "I never see room populated, purpose if apps. test results etc."
- "Tired of having to cal to get my test results. Why are they not posted here in this app."
- "2026 is not listed for disability paid."

**Pain points:**

- As a Veteran with medical appointments, I want to have detailed information about my appointments so I can adequately prepare for them, but I am blocked by not having enough appointment details such as provider name or the issue I am scheduled to be seen for.
- As a Veteran, I want to see accurate and up-to-date medical records and payment information in the app, but I'm blocked by incomplete, missing, and inaccurate information.

**Recommendation:**
Provide additional key information such as test results directly in the app to better support Veterans' health management. Ensure all information provided for medical records and payments are correct, maximally up-to-date, and complete.

### 3. Users expect additional functionality within the app to enable them to fully complete essential tasks (~10 reviews)

Users want to be able to fully manage essential benefits within the app, not just pieces of the journey, including:

- Making appointments in addition to viewing previously scheduled ones (4 reviews)
- Being able to work with civilian doctors in addition to VA ones by sending them information via the app and making appointments (2 reviews)
- Deleting messages no longer needed (2 reviews)
- Automatically sending renewal requests to providers when requesting refills for expired prescriptions (2 reviews)

**Representative responses:**

- "There is a trash folder but apparently no way to move old messages into the trash. I have messages from years ago that I can't figure out how to get out of the way so I can only look at the new important ones!!"
- "VA you did it with this app! The only thing I can see you can do to this app is allow us to schedule appointments. I think it would be to difficult to do that….. Just a thought! Great job VA on this one!"
- "There needs to be a way to refill prescriptions easier than having to write messages if they need to be renewed. We should be able to request refills and get them automatically refilled or requested to be renewed by the doctor."

**Pain points:**

- As a Veteran who uses secure messages, I want to delete old secure messages so I can focus on new and relevant messages, but I am blocked by the app not providing me the ability to delete.
- As a Veteran who has medical appointments, I want to manage all appointment based tasks directly in the app, but am blocked by my inability to book or cancel appointments in the app.

**Recommendation:**
Provide users with expanded capabilities to better meet their needs in completing the full scope of tasks such as appointment making and deleting secure messages.

### 4. Navigation and findability of key features was challenging (~9 reviews)

Veterans cited issues with unintuitive navigation and being unable to quickly locate key tasks and information including travel pay, list of doctors, and sign out, which led to confusion and risks task abandonment.

**Representative responses:**

- "Good site Takes awhile to find things Like list of my doctors This should be a tab option"
- "No place on this app to do a new travel claim" (2.67.0 user)
- "The only thing id like to see is have the sign out button on the home page. I have to go to my profile then click settings to sign out…"

**Pain points:**

- As a Veteran, I want to easily find the features I need to access my benefits and use the app, but I'm blocked by confusing navigation that runs counter to my expectations.
- As a Veteran who has medical travel I want reimbursement for, I want to easily find and submit travel pay in the app for all my eligible appointments, but I'm blocked by it being difficult to find the travel pay area in the app.

**Recommendation:**
Conduct research with users to identify user mental model and expectations for site information architecture, better understand points of confusion, and design site navigation that makes it more intuitive for users to find and complete their key tasks.
