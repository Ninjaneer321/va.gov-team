## Positive Feedback (254 ratings, 74%)

Veterans largely find the mobile app easy to use and dependable, praising its simplicity and its ability to centralize key VA health and benefits tools in one place. Many view it as a major improvement over earlier digital experiences.

**Representative responses:**

- "Simply easy to use."
- "Has the most needed things without the extra stuff. One-stop app for refills, messages, and appointment information. I like it."
- "Love the simplicity of the app to keep track of most things VA-related, refill prescriptions, and keep up with benefits."

---

## Negative Feedback (61 ratings, 18%)

Negative reviews focus on login failures, app errors, and missing or incomplete information (especially in appointment details and payments). A small number of reviews report the app "no longer works" after an update or becomes unusable due to repeated errors.

**Representative responses:**

- "No longer works properly, keeps giving errors. Useless."
- "Way too difficult signing in."
- "The appointment details should include the department and name of the doctor… Just having a date and time is very vague and unacceptable."

---

## Neutral Feedback (28 ratings, 8%)

Neutral reviews typically acknowledge that the app is helpful but point out missing details, unclear information, or additional functionality that would make it more useful. These are often framed as suggestions rather than outright complaints.

**Representative responses:**

- "I do like the app when you're trying to find out basic information but would also like to be able to look up side effects to my meds."
- "Appointment just gives location; it doesn't give type of appointment, phone extension, what kind of appointment, or room number."

## Common Themes

### 1. Login Issues (~15 reviews)

Veterans report difficulty signing in, being returned repeatedly to the login screen, or being told their information is incorrect when it is not. This theme is strongly associated with 1–2 star ratings.

**Representative responses:**

- "Way too difficult signing in."
- "It's not letting me login saying that it's not the right information, even though it's the right information."

**Recommendation:** Investigate and stabilize the login flow, particularly around credential validation and session handling. Consider clearer error messages and improved guidance when login.gov or multifactor authentication is involved.

### 2. Missing or Incomplete Information in Appointments and Documents (~6 reviews)

Several Veterans note that appointment details lack important context (department, provider name, room number), or that payment-year or other information is incomplete.

**Representative responses:**

- "The appointment details should include the department and name of the doctor a veteran is visiting… Please include this in your next update."
- "Payment by years not working. I can only read 2023; can't get 2024 or 2025 — need help with this matter."

**Recommendation:** Expand the appointment detail view to include department, provider, and room (if available) and ensure payment/benefits history loads reliably across all relevant years.

### 3. Navigation Complexity or Friction in a Few Flows (~3 reviews)

While most users praise navigation overall, a small cluster of negative reviews mentions difficulty progressing through certain screens or loops related to secure messaging and login.

**Representative responses:**

- "Unable to get past the login process after the latest update… just brings me right back to the login screen over and over."
- "When I send a secure email… the process feels clunky and hard to follow."

**Recommendation:** Audit critical user journeys (login → home, home → messages, home → appointments) for redundant screens or looping behaviors, and streamline where possible.

### 4. Prescription / Pharmacy & Follow-Up Communication Concerns (~3 reviews)

A small but important subset of reviews mentions pharmacy information being out of date or difficulty getting confirmation after care episodes.

**Representative responses:**

- "3 years out of date on pharmacy and messages… only thing it is good for is appointments."
- "I have found that the app does not notify you when you receive a secure message… I've been waiting for confirmation after an ER visit."

**Recommendation:** Ensure pharmacy data and message notifications are current and timely. Consider adding stronger in-app alerts/badges for new messages and clarifying when information is sourced from other systems.

---

## User Pain Points

### I. Login Issues (~15 reviews)

Veterans struggle to sign in or are looped back to the login screen, leading to frustration and inability to use core app functionality.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize reliability and clarity in the authentication flow: strengthen error handling, test across device versions, and provide clear paths to credential reset or support.

### II. Missing or Incomplete Appointment and Payment Details (~6 reviews)

Users report that appointment entries lack essential specifics and that some payment-year data cannot be accessed.

**Recommendation:** Enhance data feeds and UI for appointments and payments, ensuring that all detail fields provided by backend systems are surfaced to the user where feasible.

### III. Occasional App Errors and Glitches (small but impactful subset)

Some users report the app "no longer works" or frequently throws errors following updates.

**Recommendation:** Implement regression testing focused on critical flows (login, home load, messaging, medications) for new versions, and consider in-app messaging or support when known issues arise.

Experiences with disability rating information in the app are mixed. Some users appreciate being able to see their information, while others wish the app matched the functionality and detail level of the main VA website.

- "Very easy to use and the functions are excellent. Only downfall is I wish it had more of the disability information that va.gov has."

- "The VA app is my go-to for managing everything related to appointments and claims info. Love it!"

### Profile

No strong evidence in the November reviews specifically referencing managing the user profile or personal information within the app.

### Travel Pay (4.00 avg, 5 ratings)

Veterans appreciate access to travel-pay information and strongly desire the ability to submit travel claims fully within the app instead of switching to other VA sites.

- "Addition of BTSS travel pay site to have its own tab… It would be easier instead of going back to log onto myhealthevet."
- "Has all your info conveniently shown as well as travel pay compensations!"

### Messaging (3.47 avg, 34 ratings)

Secure messaging is widely used and generally appreciated, though several users note delays in responses or lack of clear notifications for new messages.

- "Has the most needed things without the extra stuff — refills, messages, and appointment information. I like it."
- "I've had to message my primary provider a couple of times… response should be within 48 hours, not a week or two."

### Prescriptions (4.55 avg, 29 ratings)

Prescription management is one of the strongest areas of the app. Users praise how easy it is to view and refill medications from their phones.

- "Love the simplicity of the app… to refill prescriptions and keep up with benefits."

## Feature Enhancement Requests

Across November reviews, several specific enhancements were requested:

- Ability to submit travel claims directly in the app rather than going through other portals
- More complete appointment details (department, provider name, room number, and contact details)
- Expanded clinical and medication information, such as side effects, and more detailed disability/benefit data comparable to VA.gov

**Representative responses:**

- "I would love for you all to add the ability to do our travel claims right in the app!"
- "I would also like to be able to look up side effects to my meds."

These enhancement opportunities, paired with the strong existing satisfaction baseline, suggest that the VA Health & Benefits mobile app is well-positioned for targeted improvements to address the most frequent pain points while building on its strengths.
