## Suggestions for Improvement (56 records, 28%)

_These records contain suggestions for improving the app._

### 1. Appointment Management

- "A more detailed explanation of where upcoming appointments are located and exactly what the appointment is would greatly help. Especially if you live in a city where multiple VA locations are located."

- "One canceled appointment was shown as active."
- "Add detail about what the appointment is for."
- "Can the name of service and doctor be added to appointment lists?"
- "On the scheduled appointments page, show both the name of service and doctor along with the date and time."
- "Provide detailed descriptions for appointments."
- "Include all necessary service details with appointments."

- "I communicate regularly through email on the application. I usually get a response within one day and it's much better than sitting on the phone for a long time. The service has been excellent."

## Negative Feedback (42 records, 21%)

_These records contain negative feedback about the app, difficulties in use, or overall dissatisfaction._

### 1. Login and Authentication Issues

- "This is my 1st iPhone, and it won't allow me to log in. Although I could on my Galaxy phone. It won't even bring up the keyboard for me to type. Why?"
- "When you use ID to log in sometimes it just stays on the screen and does not go back to the app unless you push the back button then it says you are already logged in...I just close the app and open and then I can do what I need to. My biggest thing is not being able to see what the appointment is for. I have to either call or use the web browser to see what the appointment is for. So why use the app? If I have to use both?"
- "The new logon just continues to loop and loop and loop and loop and loop. It's garbage you should've just left everyone with their MyHealtheVet login."
- "HOWEVER, the move to Login.gov was unnecessarily arcane, and the instructions were very difficult to follow and misleading, which complicated the process further."
- "Should not have to put a code in every time you open the app."
- "Why does this freakin app keep forcing me to go through a 30min sign-in process?! It reads my Face ID (that doesn't work) and forces the entire sign-in process again. So inconvenient; it pisses me off. Especially when I need documents in a timely manner."
- "Useless if I can't log in. I have an ID.me account which I can log into. This app wants me to go through the whole process again as logging into ID.me confirms my personal information then can't confirm my phone number, even though the 6-digit code was sent and received."
- "This is so stupid and frustrating that every time I want to use the app I have to sign back in through id.me and every time it wants a photo of my ID and my SSN just to sign in, I'm surprised it doesn't want my bank account info also."
- "The sign-in process on this app is the absolute worst ever!"
- "Unable to log in with ID.me. The SSO redirect is not handled by the app, resulting in an infinite login loop."
- "Unable to log in with the ID.me function. Keeps redirecting to the same page."
- "Verification link bombs out. At this point, not worth downloading."
- "During the last 2 or 3 days, it has not worked and just sits there right after the I.D. verification process."
- "Cannot log in. Revisits the same page repeatedly."
- "2 sign-ins and 2 text messages are ridiculous."
- "Not able to use the ID.me function sign-in. The page doesn't load. Not very useful so far."
- "Multiple fruitless attempts to log in based on the ID."
- "Why can't you develop an app that doesn't log you out every time there's an update released?"

### 2. Functionality and Navigation Problems

- "This is the worst app! Aside from having to change our passwords all the time, then the double and triple safety verification just to get in, and sometimes I have to do it all over again after I just successfully did it, it also makes it so difficult to email my doctor. It made me wait over 30 minutes just buffering to send my message to my doctor. I had to do it all over again. It doesn't allow Google Docs to be attached to a file, as the staff cannot open anything Google. This is nonsense! Everything is a hassle with this app."
- "I've appreciated this app over the years on several phones, but this most recent update is giving me issues. It will get to the loading application page where it sits spinning endlessly."
- "Can no longer request refills."
- "The appointment schedule does not address the reason for the appointment. I've not been able to reach a live person to speak with. One canceled appointment was shown as active."
- "The app is good but there is one detail that is quite bothersome. When sending a message to a provider, the 'save' button is visible in the upper right corner. The send button is not visible on the screen unless you scroll down. The send option should be next to the save option."
- "My messages through Secure Messages are not being delivered to my healthcare provider. They are being sent to Draft after I send them forward, which is interfering with the treatment of my Healthcare."
- "The app makes you log in every 5 minutes when messaging. Why does it need logging in so frequently?"
- "Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't."

### 3. Data and Information Accessibility Issues

- "This app is terrible. It does not provide all the information such as debts. It also does not load messages from medical."
- "Do an update so the app arranges our files according to dates, like on the website. Also, can you make the app display when our case has been assigned to a Regional Office—that would be helpful in tracing case status. We also need an alert from the app when there has been a change in stage or a document has been uploaded."
- "The VA has fallen to the worst public service entity for myself and so many other combat veterans. Not having the number 'specialist' doctors hinders necessary blood-thinning medications to be adequately prescribed and refilled without having to leave several messages."
- "I can't find the things I need, such as medical records and test results. I also don't get to see any news which is and was on the ORIGINAL VA website."
- "Everything needs to be in one site. Being transferred out to look at different items requires multiple sign-ins and confusion on where to locate some resources."
- "Not all information transferred between platforms."

### 4. Verification and User Information

- "So far, it has been very hard to get all information verified. Apparently, I am not the only one. Went to Erie to get help; the lobby is full of veterans needing help."
- "I served in the US Navy but my branch says unknown. I cannot edit my profile to update this."

### 5. General Dissatisfaction

- "Not to be sarcastic or make fun of the poor individuals who were fired, I'm also not a fan of DOGE, but it's sad that this app has been an inactive thumbnail that sat on my screen for the couple of years it's been open."
- "So many outages when I log in and check my vitals and such."
- "What happened to the comp and pension sections in the dashboard?"
- "This new update is garbage. Why show me what was deposited the month before? I want to see how much I should be receiving for my updated claim."
- "I genuinely don't understand why the app exists. Just go to VA.GOV; the app is useless."
