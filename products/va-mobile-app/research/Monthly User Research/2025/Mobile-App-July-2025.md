Users reported that the app does not work properly, with issues such as not loading, crashing, or not updating.

**User Experience and Usability (6 responses):**
Some users find the app difficult to use and describe it as slow, clunky, limited in utility, and less intuitive than desired.

Users frequently experience problems logging into the app, including endless sign-in loops, authentication issues, and the app not recognizing credentials.

### Disability Rating (5 ratings)

| Rating | % of Ratings | # of Ratings |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 60% | 3 |
| 1 | 20% | 1 |
| 4 | 20% | 1 |

**Responses:**

- "It automatically hides things like your disability percentage and payment information. I don't know why anyone would want to hide it, or why there's no setting to choose to keep it visible. It's very strange and awkward to have to show yourself what your percentage is."
- "Just wanted to thank the VA for staying current with my appeal process and this app makes that happen"
- "The app works well. I use it often to get refills. It's nice to see your rating and send messages when I need something."

### Claims (4 ratings)

| Rating | % of Ratings | # of Ratings |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 50% | 2 |
| 2 | 25% | 1 |
| 4 | 25% | 1 |

**Responses:**

- "I do not care for it. You could not do everything that you could do with My HealtheVet. I don't find it user friendly at all. I cannot see my actual claim."
- "I use the app almost daily to check the status of disability claims and messages from my doctors. Often times Veterans may have more than one entry on their claims dashboard which the VA titles exactly the same. It would be a user friendly option to give us, the Veterans, the ability to retitle or rename the claims on our dashboards within the app so that we can more easily identify the claims we are looking at a glance."
- "Appreciate that the VA is constantly working on the application. Making tweaks that are useful and rectifying the bugs. It's not perfect, but it definitely helpful for at a glance queries at claim statuses. Mahalo VA!"
- "The app works well. I use it often to get refills. But the claim tab keeps returning a red screen with an error message."

### Travel Pay (9 ratings)

| 3 | 22% | 2 |
| 1 | 11% | 1 |
| 2 | 11% | 1 |
| 4 | 11% | 1 |

**Representative responses:**

- "This app is essentially useless! Sure, a veteran can see his disability rating, monthly disability pay amount, and which branch of the military he served in, but I think ALL of us know that before we open the app. Why can't access to medical records, prescription refills, travel reimbursement, and information that is actually useful be included?"
- "The VA.gov app doesn't allow you to claim travel reimbursement or search for general information. Disappointed in the telephone support."
- "Also, please include the ability to request travel reimbursement for appts thru the app."
- "The app is great except for one thing, they finally added travel claim but then removed it. Veterans shouldn't have 1000 sites just to do claims or anything that has to do with the VA."
- "Needs to add the travel pay portal"
- "I would like someone to walk me through on how to put travel benefits online. I am computer illiterate please help."
- "Using this app makes it easier to connect with providers and staff. The latest update that allows you to submit travel claim was a great update"
- "This app has been very convenient for me to keep track of everything. But also I was on my way to an appointment today, and I got a message asking me if I would like to check in on my phone, which I did, and then it asked me if I would like to file a travel voucher, which it did for me very quickly. I'm really diggin it."
- "The app is extremely useful. Helps me keep track of appointments and fill out travel reimbursement requests"

- "Was a nice try but everything just says TBD. Does not tell you what the appointment is just that I have 14 appointments over the next 2 years, doesn't say where or with who or what time."
- "The appointment portion would be much better if it had all the information, such as provider, or why I'm being seen."
- "It would be great if the app said what our appointments were for so we can prepare accordingly."
- "Needs to put doctors' names on all appointments also where the appointment is located, and what kind of appointment it is."
- "The reason for the appointments is never filled."
- "A HUGE addition would be the app showing what clinic the medical appointments are in."
- "Although, it doesn't have enough information to tell what it actually is for."
- "The appointment reminder should have the office the appointment is scheduled for."
- "When viewing appointments or adding them to calendar it just says VA appointment and not who it is with."

**Difficulty Scheduling Appointments (6 responses):**

- "Takes MONTHS to get an appointment, then they either can't provide transportation, or they cancel my appointments for no reason."
- "It takes an act of GOD to get an appointment within a reasonable amount of time."
- "There is no place in the app to schedule an appointment."
- "I would give them a 5 Star review, but it's so hard to get a hold of someone to schedule a ride, that sometimes you end up having to reschedule your appointment."
- "Easy to work and easy to order refills. Helps track my appointments and easy to request an appointment."
- "I prefer going to my VA. I need an appointment, no problems. Quicker than my family doctor getting me an appointment."

### Messaging (42 ratings)

Feedback is generally positive for the messaging feature. Many users are satisfied with the app's convenience and usefulness in managing their healthcare. Some users report problems with the messaging feature or mention missing functionality such as deleting or managing messages.

**Convenient Way to Communicate:**

- "This is the fastest way to communicate with any of your providers."
- "I'm glad to have this app to quickly send and receive messages with my care team."
- "App needs to allow more time to complete a secure message before timing out. Should at least have a draft mode."

**Messaging Pain Points:**

- "The new messages format is too many steps."
- "The app will not allow me to delete old messages and it's a hassle to have to keep scrolling through ones that are no longer pertinent. Please fix."
- "The messaging app does not work for deleting messages and instead gives you the option to put the old message back into your inbox."
- "The messaging app does not give you the option to send messages to your current healthcare providers."
- "I'm mostly very happy with the workings of the VA app, my least favorite is trying to message a person I've dealt with previously who isn't on my To: Folder."
- "Recent version removed secure messaging. Please restore this functionality."
- "The messages section is glitchy and doesn't always show the full conversation."
- "Inability to cut and paste messages"
- "I've had so many issues with the messaging aspect. I can't upload files and send them to my provider. For an app that's supposed to make communication with providers and veterans easier, I still have to pick up the phone and go through a 45 minute wait just to get to my doctor's office to relay information that should've taken 45 seconds."
- "Last update is awesome. It's a great app. However, I am unable to move any messages to a deleted message folder, as there is no option to do so. The only option or folder available is the 'In' box. Minus 1 star for this bug."
