## Suggestions for Improvement (42 reviews, 25%)

### Communication Issues

- "Unable to send messages directly."
- "Most of my medical team in Tennessee Valley Healthcare System doesn't provide for communication through the app."
- "Getting better with every update. The app is simple and getting easier to retrieve information. Appointment information could be more clarifying with accurate provider info, clinic info, locations and reason for appt."
- "This app is a great place to do most of your VA communications and see documents. Need to add travel reimbursement button to the appointment so veterans can more easily file claims to many different systems to use with VA. Add telehealth phone number"

### Payment Issues

- "Unable to make payments from the app. Will not accept bank information. Nor does it give a reason for not accepting"
- "Recommend split disbursement capability for VA disability payments."
- "Love this new app! Would be 5 stars if we could file travel reimbursement claims thru the app as well."
- "What I would really like to see added is the ability to file for travel reimbursement."

### Pharmacy and Prescription Issues

- "I have absolutely no faith that the pharmacy will fill my prescription. I've had problems with them for months now. I submitted a refill of a prescription almost two weeks ago and they filled it on May 23rd, I haven't yet received it, it's a roll of the dice."
- "I enjoy the fact that I don't have to sign on to the website to get access to messages, appointments, and medication information. I will say that I do wish that there was more information about appointments."

### Privacy and Security

- "The initial page of the app discloses my monthly stipend for my disability benefits. Anyone glancing at my phone when the app opens can clearly see that total. That information should be buried somewhere else, possibly somewhere under benefit information. Please address this!!"

### Technical Issues

- "Make your coders use an older device with poor connectivity to test the usability of the app. Not all VETERANS have T1 fiber optic backbone connections to use this app on."
- "App is great, except that for the last month EVERY time I go to look at it, I have to fully sign in. Even though I have it set to open with biometrics."
- "Going through sign-in multiple times"
- "The new and improved VA app is worse than ever"
- "The government actually requisitioned a functional application. Now hire these people for the rest of the federal systems."

### Medical Records and Information

- "Add medical documents included within each appointment. Doctors refuse to give me copies to create a claim. They ALL claim it'll be accessible on this app. It's been 1 1/2 years and I have yet to see a single X-ray included. CREATE A LINK WITHIN THE APPOINTMENT SECTION TO SHOW US WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED DURING EACH APPOINTMENT!"
- "It would be great if we could see lab results and order equipment like filters, cpap, hearing aid etc."
- "Needs to include lab results and access to other records."

### Appointment Information

- "The app is nice it would be great if you put what the appointment was for. (primary, pulmonary, ENT etc.)"
- "Listing only the clinic name ie. Saturn, does not describe the reason for the appointment and how to prepare for it, leaving me with questions. Some clinics have five or more clinics under one name."
- "The departments need to be more defined. Ie, eye clinic, physical therapy, primary care providers."
- "I would find it helpful to know what upcoming appointment is for."
- "Medical appointment information is always incomplete. The clinic or medical area as well as the doctors needs to be included."
- "I will say that I do wish that there was more information about appointments."
- "Medical appointment information needs improvement."

### General Suggestions

- "Needs work"
- "This is an awesome App, specially if we as Disabled Veterans use it to our full advantage. The only negative is, Veterans don't use it enough, and then get mad at not been able to have access to resources available to us all."
- "I like the app but please go back to showing what the total compensation is at the current rating, not just the last month's payment."
- "Make more improvements."
- "Update the app for better performance."

### Miscellaneous

- "I do not have a Work number yet this program asked for one. I am retired from Mil and a private company."
- "Would recommend this app if you been in the military."

### Login Issues

- "Haven't been able to log on in over month. App Continues to tell me account suspended even after changing password"
- "Really poor design to send me to the VA.gov webpage to log into the app. It's redundant and lacks functionality. Update: it doesn't even log in anymore"
- "Just like the VA, won't grant access and log in and tells me no"
- "The 'new look' methods for logging into VA is really garbage. It takes longer to get anything done, such as Rx refill, because of so many added steps. It is annoying to have to deal with the added 'security measures' for either IDMe or VA.gov. I wonder how many vets who have poor tech skills just give up and come into the hospital to do things that were so easy to accomplish using the old VA format?"
- "Access requires too many passwords!!! Also, login.gov, ID.me is too confusing. I want to use one access point & one passcode (number). Password character is too long!"
- "Fix this and I'll change to 5 stars"
- "Access methods never function properly!!!"
- "Cannot log into the app using the Brave Browser."
- "Had to uninstall then reinstall the app."
- "Sometimes the app just goes round and round in circles."
- "Had to re-log in."
- "Stops working."

### Messaging and Communication

- "Why even have a message board if no one answers just don't have one if messages can't be answered so we don't waste our time typing messages"
- "Chat options are confusing and unclear."

### Payment Issues

- "Was not paid now for two months because of the unusual service of the VA"

### Navigation and Usability

- "I liked it better when the main VA page and the My Healthy Vet were on separate sites."
- "The VA has improved over the years but it can be very frustrating."
- "Disapproves of new features of the application, causing reluctance to use."

### Browser Compatibility

- "Cannot log into the app using the Brave Browser."
- "Cannot log into the app using the Brave Browser (does not accept the SMS code input, gives error message)."

### Technical Issues

- "Disqualifies email."
- "Update won't download"
- "I was on a video conference with Cardiology. We had hooked up & after about 5 minutes or so, my screen went black! It was impossible to return to the conference."
