# CX Platform Pain Point Catalog

## Ranking Factors

- **Severity:** High (user cannot accomplish main task or would do it wrong), Medium (can accomplish but with some confusion/workarounds/minor errors), Low (would be better user experience if pain point resolved)
- **Trending/Frequency:** First time issue vs. found in multiple research reports/sources
- **Number of Users Impacted:** Edge case/1 team, some platform users, majority of users, impacts all platform users
- **Legal/Risk Obligation:** e.g., accessibility issue or data privacy issue

| Rank | Pain Point | Severity | Trending/Frequency | Users Impacted | Legal/Risk | Evidence | Key Mitigation | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | As a member of an experience team, I want to self-serve and find answers to my questions, but I am blocked by the inability to find documentation or trust that it is up to date. | High | Found in multiple research reports/sources | Majority of platform users | None | | Create documentation in response to user requests and proactively create documentation for anticipated user needs | In progress — early stages, long way to go |
| 2 | As a mobile team member, I want to ensure each feature is compliant with our design and engineering best practices before release, but I am blocked by not having visibility into what is being built or planned for the app. | High | Reported multiple times by multiple users; will become increasingly severe as platform scales | Majority of platform users (especially designers and engineers building new or larger features) | None | | 1) Design critiques to give cross-app visibility into what is being built; 2) Improved communication about what is being released; 3) Accelerate getting the mobile design system fully up to date | In progress — actively working on mitigations |
| 3 | As a mobile or experience team member, I need test users to validate or demo my feature, but I am blocked by not knowing how to find or create test users for all the use cases. | Medium | Frequently reported | Majority of engineers building into the app | None identified (production test user restrictions may have policy implications — TBD) | | 1) Gain more ownership over test users on the mobile platform; 2) Identify the right contacts for requesting test user access; 3) Document how to create new test users for various use cases; 4) Explore a self-service test user catalog or tool | |
| 4 | As a backend engineer, I want to have access to all upstream service documentation, but I am blocked by teams that have integrated with these services not properly documenting or retaining information. | Medium | Multiple backend users have reported this | Backend engineers (smaller but significant portion of platform audience) | None | | Currently creating documentation to address gaps | In progress |
| 5 | As a member of an experience team, I want to avoid rework or delays in having my code approved, but I am blocked by not knowing how to meet expected accessibility best practices. | Medium | Low frequency of reports currently, but high risk if not addressed proactively | Designers and engineers (majority of platform users are aware of the requirement but need proper tooling) | Yes — legal requirement to deliver a fully accessible app | | 1) Updated PR template to include additional accessibility details (partially resolved); 2) Review and update accessibility documentation to prevent surprises when work is sent back for rework | Partially resolved — PR template updated; accessibility documentation review still needed |
| 6 | As a mobile team member, I want to be sure the list of users with access to our tools and systems is up to date and accurate, but I am blocked by not having any easy way to know when someone has changed roles or left their company or the VA. | Medium | Has happened multiple times — systems out of date during gaps in awareness | Mobile team | Yes — risk of unauthorized access to systems if off-boarded users are not removed promptly | | Find ways to be notified of off-boarding events and maintain visibility into who has access to tools and systems at any given time | |
