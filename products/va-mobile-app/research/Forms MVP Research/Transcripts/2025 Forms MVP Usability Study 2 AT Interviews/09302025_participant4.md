# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Christine**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes **Notetaker First Name** and our accessibility specialist **AT Specialist First Name** will be on the call available to provide support with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology should you need it.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out forms from the VA mobile app. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using the VA Health & Benefits App. As you go through these steps please speak aloud your thoughts and actions to help us understand more about your experience.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing an app to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I‚Äôve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don‚Äôt link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let‚Äôs start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right? **Yes**
    - Thanks for confirming that.

2. What kind of device are you using today? *(Tablet / Smartphone)* **Smartphone**
    - *(If not the expected device, ask to rejoin that way)*

3. What operating system is on your device? *(iOS / Android / _______)* **iOS iphone 15**

4. What is the default web browser set up on your device? *(Chrome / Firefox / Edge / Safari / _______)* **Safari**

5. What type of assistive technology are you using right now? **VoiceOver**

6. How many years have you been using [assistive technology]? **4 years**

7. When or how often do you use it? **Daily, read things to me especially lengthy pieces of text. Or to navigate some apps. Turning apps on or off, or navigating through apps. I do have a little bit of vision in one eye.**

8. How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader/magnifier--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert? **Intermediate**

9. Have you ever shared your screen in Zoom while using a screen reader/magnifier? **Yes**

10. Have you ever filled out a VA form online before? **Yes**
   - If so, can you tell me about your most recent experience? How did it go? **Tend not to fill them out when using the iphone because I'm more likely to make mistakes on a small screen.**
  
11. Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app downloaded on your device? **Yes**
   - If so, can you tell me what you use the mobile app primarily for? How has your experience been so far? **Use it to check my messages from my provider, possible order and reorder drugs, my medications. Use it to check lab results or medical tests.**

**It was good before, now it requires ID.me to sign in. Before ID.me allowed you to use google to sign in and that was just easier for me to use google. Now I think I've gotten in there since then, if I did I must have it saved, I must have gotten in there.**


# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your whole screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

We can help guide you through sharing your screen when you're ready if you'd like assistance. Please say what you're doing out loud so that if there are any issues, we'll know what they are.
1. Make sure that the Zoom application has focus
2. Navigate to the screen share button (may need to tap on mobile device to display the menu at the bottom, may have to scroll over to see menu options).
3. Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane
4. Activate the screen share

**(If video window is covering up phone screen)** It looks like my zoom video is covering up a lot of your screen. Could you please swipe it off? (Screen reader: swipe right until the video window has focus, and then double tap when you hear "Stash preview".)

**User had a lot of difficulty finding the share button in the menu. Couldn't tab over initially when the menu was showing and stopped right before the share option. Kept pulling up a different menu without the share option. When she found it stated, it's clear to the right and it would disappear after a few seconds before she could get to it.**

## Task 00: Open prototype
**for iOS users:** 
Did you previously receive the link and instructions to download the testing version of the mobile app today?

Y - Were you able to download the app via those instructions? Y - skip down to note for all users

N - I can now share the URL: that takes you to download the testing app, How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, email it to you, or (for smartphone only) text it to you.
**[iOS url here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/RrO0Cw2q)**  Build #3031 version 2.59.1
**[Android link](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/6bea6c3fabc1a872)** Build #2850 build version 2.59.0
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test)*

Did you get the link? 

- *If ‚Äúunsupported browser‚Äù error, ask to try a different browser or device, or share my screen (works for anyone) and mouse control (doesn't work w/iPhones)*
- *If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

Please click the (green) "Continue" button.

Instructions to access prototype for **iOS users**(must access from your mobile device):
1. Use the link provided to install test flight on your mobile device.
2. Once you've installed it (or if you already have it installed), select step 2 "view in test flight" from your mobile device.
3. Under App Informaton at the bottom of the screen, select "Previous builds"
4. Select the VA Health and Benefits mobile app version:2.59.1
5. Select 'Install' button next to correct build number 3031 (may have to select Load more builds to find version).
6. It can take a few minutes to download.
7. Once downloaded select "next".
8. Select "start testing" from the Share feedback screen.

**for Android users:** 
1. You will receive an email invite to the email you supplied us to download the testing app. Please navigate to your email and select that link now.
2. Open the email and click on "Get started"
3. It may require you to sign in again to authorize the install.
4. Go to your Google play store > Go to your profile icon in the top right > Go to settings > About > click on play store version 7 times (may need to Select "app permissions")
5. Receive a note "You are now a developer"
6. Scroll up and press General, click on "Developer options"
7. Toggle the "interal app sharing"
8. Return to the window with the steps
9. Download the release (ensure newest one #7)
10. If you already have the app installed you'll have to select "Uninstall"
11. And then go ahead and "Install"
12. Pause before signing in

**Note for all users: You'll be interacting with a demo prototype today.** Since it's a demo, note that none of your actions will affect your own VA information or benefits.


**User did not read the email enough to see or predownload the testing app. I added the link in the chat and she was able to go through the steps and download the app with us on the call.** 
**At this point the user enabled VoiceOver, previously while answering questions she didn't want to turn it on yet because its confusing when in a conversation because it talks in your ear while others are talking. Participant also had magnifier and uses that at times. Doesn't use it much.**

## Task 1: Login to the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
[start on the VA Health and Benefits mobile app version: 2.59.1 (3031) for iOS]

I'd like you to take a look at this screen, and sign in.

[When they get to the homepage:] Any data used throughout this test is not your real data or connected to your VA account in any way. This is a test environment with artifical testing data displayed only. 

**For screen magnifier participants.**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] "What is on your screen now?

Are you seeing the participants screen magnified at all? 

If not, ask the participant to check their settings on their device by navigating to...

1. Settings
2. Accessibility
3. Zoom
4. Show while mirroring toggle on



## Task 2: Start a statement
As we go through the steps in this study, please talk aloud about what you're thinking BEFORE clicking on anything.

Today I'd like you to pretend that you need to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself using the VA Health & Benefits Mobile App. 

### Question for testing participant:

- Before we start, what do you expect this process to be like?
**I expect it to have some questions, I'm hoping because its my app it automatially fills in some of the data that it knows.**
**First, I think I would go to Claims, there is a forms option but I don't know what form to use so I wouldn't first go to the forms.**

Thank you for sharing that, You may begin the task to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself.

*Allow the user to navigate to and through the form on their own without guiding them through the happy path. 

### If the user gets lost...

On a path that isn't fully built out and is stuck, you can offer the 'Apple' button at the top to jump them to the forms section of the app.


### Watch for:
- How the user gets to forms. Do they click anything other than "Go to Forms"? Y/N

**Yes**

 - If Y, where do they go instead?

**Claims > Active Claims > Didn't hear anything that said submit. > Claims > Claims History > Benefits > Homepage > Go to forms.**

- Does the user mentions any confusion on where to go to start a new statement. Y/N

**Yes**

 - If Y, what do they find confusing?

 **Thought it should be under claims, could not find anything that read her to start a new claim or submit a new statement.**

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

**Initially while on claims she thought she had swipped up to go backwards where she first heard the forms. She did not realize she wasn't going back far enough and was still on the claims area of the app.**
**I now lost the forms. I saw the forms, heard the forms before. I'm trying to swipe up and I'm not finding my forms before.**
**Tried Home tab**

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

 **That didn't make sense to me because I'm starting a statement, I don't know what the statement is for. It doesn't tell me what the statement is for.**

- Did the user understand the 'Submit a statement in support of a claim' introductory screen? Y/N

**Yes**

 - Did the user comment on this screen?

**I can choose more supporting forms. Ok, I need to use more than one form for each statement.**
**Focus jumped to the bottom and she hit continue.**

- What option did the user select on the 'What would you like to do here?' screen?

**What I want to do isn't listed here**

  - Did the user share any confusion about the options provided?

**Well I don't have an open claim. We are doing a new claim. You can do this for your claim. I'm looking for something that says I want to provide a statement for a new claim. This says a claim but... I would actually pick 'What I want to do isn't listed here. So I guess I would probably waste my time by going to 'What I want to do isn't listed here'.**


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the form from your [assistive tech/device]? 
**It was actually pretty easy, Except when I went into the claims portion. I thought I went back but I wasn't back to the home screen.**

- How confident do you feel that you're in the right place to submit your statement?
**50% confident**

- Before you start the form itself, what do you expect this form completion process to be like?
**I expect it to know my information and I to just approve it. Then come to a place where I can use my microphone to write my statement.**

## Task 3: Fill out the form [never back out or reload the page]
As you go through this form I'll ask that you please fill it out using fake details so you don't share your personal information with me. 
**Well, I guess my dream of having it all filled out for me is gone.**
**For screen magnifier participants:**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] First, I'd like to confirm "What is on your screen now? 

Thank you.

You may continue on with the form.

### Watch for:
- Does the user encounter any errors when entering the data into the form fields? Y/N
**yes**

 - If Y, what field do they encounter errors on?
 **First tried to use mircrophone to voice to text. It wasn't working. AT specialist noted that it may be because we are using zoom at the same time.**
**Also, received an error on the birthdate field.**
**Received an error when entering the SSN field.**

 - What triggered the error specifically?
 **Just navigating between the separate areas of the field, from month to day to year caused a validation error everytime because the full date field wasn't completed yet.**
 **On the SSN field they initially typed too many numbers.**
   
 - Does the user understand how to correct the error? 
**You're already failing at this guys because I thought it would be easier than typing all this stuff. It keeps telling me I got an error everytime I select a date.**
**It's interesting because it doesn't go to Step 2, it goes to the header [on the next page with their VoiceOver focus].**
**Again if this is my app how come it doesn't know my social security number? I have no idea how many numbers I have in there. Its only showing my the last numbers, I have no idea.**
**[After attempt to correct]Then it's telling me again that I have invalid data.**

- Does the user experience any difficulty completing the fields from their mobile device Y/N
**Yes**

 - If Y, what specific challenges did they experience?


 - How did the user troubleshoot these challenges?

- Does the user express thoughts of frustration while completing the form? Y/N
**Yes**

 - If Y, what did they experience when expressing the frustration?
 **Errors on field validation problems. In ability to perceive how many #s they entered into the SSN field. In ability to hear all numbers entered only last few.**


## Task 4: (After SSN before 'Continue') take a break in filling out the form
At this point, I'm going to have you pretend that you need to step away from the form for an extended period of time, you can leave the form now and go back to the homepage of the mobile app. 


### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?
**User would select 'Finish this application later'. Although, at the bottom of the screen, hold on, it says we've saved your application. At 10.43 a.m. So, actually, now, at this point, if I saw that. and I heard that, then I would go to the home screen, I would jump back.**
  
 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?
**I don't trust it. I would save it because it was difficult for me to get here.**

- What does the user do to leave the form?
**Now at this point I would jump back to the homescreen. I would go 'Done'.**

- Does the user express doubt that their work will be saved? Y/N
**No**

### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the homepage of the app from the partially completed form [screen reader/assistive tech/device]? 
**It was good. I like the fact that it jumped up and said that it autosaves. That gives me confidence.**

- How confident do you feel that your work will be saved?
**I'm probably, you know, 99% I would be disappointed if it wasn't there.**


## Task 5: Continue completing the started form and submit
Now, pretend you are ready to come back to your previous form. 

Please locate your previous form and continue on.


### Watch for:

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?
**Go to My Forms. I would go to active. There we go, statement in support of a claim. Well, I'm clicking on it. Nothing is happening... Okay, so this is the form that I was working on. I would‚Ä¶ when I'm double-clicking, It stops‚Ä¶ okay, so it stops on active forms. and I double-click on it, And‚Ä¶ It just keeps staying there, it's not jumping to the next one.**

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

 **So then I come to statement in support of a claim, and I double-click on it, and it isn't moving, but it allows me to double-click. So then I just keep moving forward, because I'm realizing. nothing is happening. And then I double-click on this, and when I double-click on that, I expect it...to open up in the form, but it's not happening. So, I move forward. and I come to draft, and then I'll double-click on Draft. And I expect it to open up to a draft. And nothing happens. And so I move forward again, and it goes 30 days left to complete, and then I move forward till I find continue to form.**

- Does the user understand that they are continuing with the same form they started at the beginning of the session? Y/N

**Yes**

**And now it's retrieving‚Ä¶ And that bothers me, that it says you must enter it [SSN], but it's already in there.**

 - If no, what do they mention that is confusing?

- Is the user able to complete the started form? Y/N
**Yes**

 - If no, what prohibited them from submitting the initial form?


### Observation points for screen reader users:

- Does the participant navigate linearly or jump between sections?
**At times the focus jumps to blank space on the edges of the page, or once jumped to the bottom and then the user had to tab back up.**
  
- How do they orient themselves when they lose focus?
**They go back to the heading of the page and then work back through the page until they land on where they needed to be.**
  
- Do they use heading navigation, landmarks, or other AT-specific features?
  **Headings**

### Questions for screen magnifier users:

- Are you able to percieve the full form field labels and any error messages?
  
- Do you need to scroll horizontally to see all content?

**VA file number. I have no idea what my VA file number is. So I don't know what to put in there. And I click on VA file number, and I'm not finding any information. Need help. Okay, I hae no idea what to put in for VA file number. When I click on the word VA file number, you know, and I double-click nothing is happening. So I double tap it and you know, the keyboard comes up, but I don't know what to put in there. At this point I would throw my phone against the wall. I would call... I would actually call my national service officer because I don't do this stuff. I always recommend people get a service officer, and that they never do this stuff on their own...**

**At this point I would call a phone number down there that says if you need help call us at...**

**Then I expect to be on hold for 20 mins while I explain who I am and what I'm trying to do. But I would be frustrated at this point because I don't know my VA file number.**

[After seeing address fields]
**Again, I'm thinking you guys know who I am, because this is my VA app, and all my information is in there, and now I'm frustrated that I have to [type]. At least you allowed U.S. in there, because most military veterans live in the U.S, so I appreciate that.**

**My phone allows me to pick addresses that are already in my phone to put in there. Except it only allows me to do the street and not the rest of it [when he selected the recommended text address from his phone it did not also generate the City, State, Postal code].**

[User got an error on phone field]

**For some reason his phone added a word 'years' after he was typing in the phone number digits causing it to fail the field validation and resulting in the error. User thought he had entered perhaps too many numbers so he attempted to delete and retype.**

**When I try to delete it's becoming frustrating clearing this because I'm using my little back button. [Retyped, then used phone recommended prefill for email address].**

**His audio would not work for voice to text for the provide a statement as he tried it [because he was on zoom at the same time].**

**User selected Expand all to preview entered information on review page. His focus jumped around after the SSN field, went to the side of the screen where there was blank space.**

**What bothers me as a blind person, and using voice over. I just hear the last four, I don't know if the other part is correct [regarding the SSN field]. So I double click on it. And I'm not seeing the edit button for that, to double check It. [attempts to find an edit option] Okay, edit identification information. Okay, there we go. So, I did my social security number. But when I came back, it jumped to something completely different. Okay. I would have expected it to jump back to‚Ä¶Where it was editing my social security number. And that's‚Ä¶ And‚Ä¶ And when the voiceover is reading the number [postal code field it's reading 33,966], I would expect the voiceover to read individual numbers. You know, code it so that it's 3-3-9-6-6 ‚Ä¶ It reads my phone number fine. But it reads a zip code. It was a big, long thing.**

**And now it wants my full name. And‚Ä¶ and this is interesting, because it‚Ä¶ nowhere did it say that, are you filling this form out for somebody else? So, I'm assuming that this is a form you have to fill out for yourself, so I don't know why it's‚Ä¶ why it isn't having your name in there. If you just filled out your statement, why doesn't it repeat your name in here, and then ask you to verify that this is your name? [user got an error because the way he typed the name wasn't exact to how he typed it in previously]. So‚Ä¶ It says, please enter your name exactly as it appears on your application. So, why aren't they entering it? Why aren't you entering it? That's just silly, because‚Ä¶ It's funny that it repeats it, because it's looking to see if you're doing it right. And I'm sitting here going, well, if you know what it's supposed to be, and you're a computer, why didn't you just put it in again? ...[realizes he forgot the middle initial] Oh, I didn't put the A in there.**

[Submitted the form]

**I‚Ä¶ I would expect for it to say your form has been submitted.And it jumps me back‚Ä¶To a page that says, submit a statement to support a claim.[the header on the confirmation page reads submit a statement to support a claim so that is what the user hears when landing on the confirmation page.] And then it lists my form submission. And then it says, your submission is in progress. I would have expected it to say, you have successfully submitted your form. Okay, and I'm laughing at this line, that it says it can take up to 30 days to receive your form, when‚Ä¶I hit the button to submit.So‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ In my‚Ä¶ in my brain. if I've submitted the form, I expect them to say, we've received your form, it can take us up to 30 days to do something else, but not to receive it. received means‚Ä¶ in their computer, I guess - and then it gives me a confirmation number. This is a confirmation page. And what doesn't make sense is the title of this is Submit a Statement To support a claim. And I think that submit a statement to support a claim means the verb submit, so that this is where you would go to submit another claim. I wouldn't‚Ä¶Expect this to be the acknowledgement. I would‚Ä¶ this page should have been titled Confirmation Page or something, not Submit a Claim. Okay. They'll confirm when they receive my form in‚Ä¶ okay, so this says, we'll confirm when we receive your form in our system. I thought I was in the system already. So‚Ä¶ That's not making sense to me. That this is their system to submit a form. And when they say they'll confirm, when we receive it your form in our system, I would have expected hitting submit meant That their form‚Ä¶ that the form was in their system.**

**So‚Ä¶ Yeah, this is the other one that can take up to 30 days. Okay. What else?**


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience filling out the form from the mobile app using your [assistive tech/device]? 
**It was difficult. Typing in letter by letter. When using voiceover, you have to get to the letter, and then you have to select the letter, and then you have to double-tap it. Then you have to go find another letter and double-tap it. And that's a very arduous process. Because, in longer words, you forget where you're at. And‚Ä¶ when‚Ä¶ You need to correct it. It was‚Ä¶ it was hard, because sometimes the insertion point was going to the beginning, and you would have to get the insertion point to start deleting things at the end. And I know that when you try sometimes to put the insertion point in the middle of the word, you have no idea where you're at. So that's always difficult. And again, this is my app with my information. I don't know why it didn't auto-populate and ask me if it was correct. Especially when, at the end, it knew‚Ä¶ that really frustrated me. It knew what my name was on the form, so why didn't it just‚Ä¶ Populate it into the Name thing at the end.**

- Were there any fields where your assistive technology didn't work as expected?
**When I came back into things, I would have expected to be at the top of the form, not In the middle of the form. I would have expected, when I jumped to the next page, for it to tell me, like, this is step two. Not to just start filling in the information. I would have expected it to go to the top of the page, but it wasn't. And maybe that's because I can't see sort of where it is. I'm expecting it to read me what's at the top of the page, not just to jump down in the middle of the step.**

- What worked well for you?
**The fact that it did autosave, That was good.**

- What was unclear for you?
**Where I was supposed to go. I would have expected to go to claims to try to do that. And it was hard to find in claims if it was there. And then even when I was in the form, it‚Ä¶ it wasn't clear on, basically, starting a new claim. I would have expected it to stay, start a new claim.**
**also the VA, the VA file number, that wasn't clear. I know it didn't say it was required, I think, but it was frustrating, because there wasn't anything more on there to find out about it. Like, where I would find my VA file number, or‚Ä¶If it is a VA file number, then shouldn't it be in my app?**

- How does this compare to filling out forms on VA.gov or other websites?
**I guess when you're on another website, you see more, data all at once. When you're on the phone, you're only doing it pretty much one step at a time. You do have the title at the top, so you kind of know what step you're on. It's one of six, so you won't‚Ä¶ you don't expect that much, on an online form, you kind of see everything all at once.**

- What would make this process feel familiar to you?
**Doing it more often.**
**Having it inside the claims where it was easier to find.**
**And maybe this was just part of the testing but I wasn't able to use my microphone.**

- If you had to take breaks, where would there be natural stopping points?
**I think before you were typing in what you wanted to say [the statement field]. Because you get all your regular data out there. t would be like, oh, okay, what am I going to say in this form?**

 
## Task 6: View submitted form
Now that you have completed the form, please go back to the app.

**I'm trying back buttons in there. Okay, there's the home. Okay, so I would expect to go to Active Claims. That's bothering me, because it says 5 active, and I thought there were 5 active before this process. So, I select active. [user is tabbing through all listed active claims looking for this statement to support a claim or a new claim related to this form he just completed] 1 to 10 of 42? Wow. [regarding pagination] I'll try all the way at the end.  Nope, so it's obviously not here. Claims history. And that isn't working very well. I'm moving back. So let me try going to forms...**


### Questions for testing participant: 
- Based on what you see now, how do you know the form was submitted?
**I'm coming over here to complete. And I'm clicking it, and it says. I don't have any. So I go back here, And‚Ä¶I would be really frustrated at this point. I could try the messages. To see if they sent me a message. That my form was submitted. [user looks in secure messaging and listens through messages] Nope, not there. [looks under claims, active, selects benefits tab] But we've been here before, and I've been to the‚Ä¶ 40 pages. So, I would call. Get somebody on there.**

- What does this status mean to you? 
**[user selected go to my forms > tabbed to engage complete > noticed it was empty > tabbed to go active...Oh! Active, it says it was a draft saved That doesn't give me confidence, because I thought I submitted it. So, I thought I'd hit submit. And I'm lost, I have no idea.**

- If you needed to reference this form submission in a phone call with VA, what information would you look for?
**I would‚Ä¶ I would‚Ä¶ the date that I filled out the form. There was a number on there, but I didn't print it out. They took my email, so maybe they sent me a copy in my email that I filled out the form. But it's‚Ä¶ frustrating that That form is still appearing as a draft. And then I would probably‚Ä¶ Go back to that draft, And resubmit it.**

**And when I went to, active, and then I go completed. It says I don't have any completed forms. ACTIVE says statement in support of a claim. So‚Ä¶ It says 30 days left to complete. I guess I would go to Continue Form and see what it says. And then try to resubmit it. brought me back to the same‚Ä¶ So, it says it saved my form, but it's not even appearing when I went on the draft.**

- What would you expect to see if you needed to check on your submission later?
**I would expect under‚Ä¶ Completed forms. for it to be there, or under claims. I would expect something under claims. And I would expect to see that I submitted a form on this date. But it bothers me that it says it can take 30 days to receive the form. I have no idea where my form is right now, because I submitted it, but it says they haven't received it yet, so‚Ä¶I don't even know that‚Ä¶ I've submitted it anymore.**

- How would you expect to be notified of updates to this form?
**I would expect it to appear in something like my messages. It says there is a secure messaging on the app so that would be the logical place for them to notify me. You know, other apps‚Ä¶ work that way, like my banking app. You know, they've got a little notification thing that says, hey, you have, you know, two more notifications. So you look there, and you go to your notifications.**


### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user express confidence that they have completed and submitted their form?
**No**

 - If no, what is confusing to them and why?
**Form said status draft under active, and when he clicks continue form is starts him at the beginning introductory pages.**

- Does the user understand the status of the form?
**No**

 - If not, what do confusion do they express when interpretting the form status?
**The user would expect the form to be listed as completed because he completed it but it shows under active. The user is confused by the wording about 30 days for the va to receive it after submitting because he believes that he is already using the VA system and that if he submitted it it should already be in the system.**


### Deleting the testing app:
Now that we have completed the study today I'm going to assist you with deleting the VA testing app from your device. 

**iOS users:** 
If you navigate to your device home screen, and engage the menu screen of the VA testing app we used today select 'Delete app'. Remove from device.

**Android users:***

1. We now need to ensure you turn off the developer options we turned on for the test from the "Google Play Store".
2. Navigate back to ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
3. Select ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù
4. Go back to the main phone home screen, lower menu bar select square in the middle.
5. Swipe up to remove Google Play Store window
6. Now go back to the main screen, open the ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
7. Click on your name in the top right 
8. Settings > General > Click on the ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù > Toggle off ‚ÄúInternal app sharing‚Äù
9. Go to settings on phone > scroll to bottom > click on developer options > Toggle on top for on/off > Toggle off (it will obscure the screen because of screen share)
10. Go back one, there should be no developer mode.
11. Reinstall the VA app

(hint: to switch browser windows the user can select the three lines III in the bottom left corner of their lower nav. menu)

## Thank You and Closing - 3 minutes

- How was this process overall for you?
**It was very frustrating. Because‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ just because I really‚Ä¶ I guess I really expected, my data‚Ä¶ To be automatically imported or pre-populated in there. at the last part, when it says, type your name, it's like, okay, I just threw in a name, and it's like, no, it's not matching the form, and it's like, well, if you want it to match the form, then you can do that! You can just put it in there.**
