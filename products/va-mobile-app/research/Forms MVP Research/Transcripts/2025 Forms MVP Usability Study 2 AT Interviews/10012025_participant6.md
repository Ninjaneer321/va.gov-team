# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Christine**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes **Notetaker First Name** and our accessibility specialist **AT Specialist First Name** will be on the call available to provide support with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology should you need it.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out forms from the VA mobile app. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using the VA Health & Benefits App. As you go through these steps please speak aloud your thoughts and actions to help us understand more about your experience.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing an app to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I‚Äôve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don‚Äôt link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

**Participant confirmed yes**

  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

**Participant confirmed yes**

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No
 
  **Participant confirmed yes**

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your whole screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

We can help guide you through sharing your screen when you're ready if you'd like assistance. Please say what you're doing out loud so that if there are any issues, we'll know what they are.
1. Make sure that the Zoom application has focus
2. Navigate to the screen share button (may need to tap on mobile device to display the menu at the bottom, may have to scroll over to see menu options).
3. Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane
4. Activate the screen share

**(If video window is covering up phone screen)** It looks like my zoom video is covering up a lot of your screen. Could you please swipe it off? (Screen reader: swipe right until the video window has focus, and then double tap when you hear "Stash preview".)

**Note for all users: You'll be interacting with a demo prototype today.** Since it's a demo, note that none of your actions will affect your own VA information or benefits.


## Task 1: Login to the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
[start on the VA Health and Benefits mobile app version: 2.59.1 (3031) for iOS]

I'd like you to take a look at this screen, and sign in.

[When they get to the homepage:] Any data used throughout this test is not your real data or connected to your VA account in any way. This is a test environment with artifical testing data displayed only. 

**For screen magnifier participants.**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] "What is on your screen now?

Are you seeing the participants screen magnified at all? 

If not, ask the participant to check their settings on their device by navigating to...

1. Settings
2. Accessibility
3. Zoom
4. Show while mirroring toggle on



## Task 2: Start a statement
As we go through the steps in this study, please talk aloud about what you're thinking BEFORE clicking on anything.

Today I'd like you to pretend that you need to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself using the VA Health & Benefits Mobile App. 

### Question for testing participant:

- Before we start, what do you expect this process to be like?

**I imagine there will be some menus or link menus on the page and I should be able to find what you requested and I'm hoping I don't have to type much because I'm horrible at typing on this thing**
  

Thank you for sharing that, You may begin the task to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself.

*Allow the user to navigate to and through the form on their own without guiding them through the happy path. 

**User is going through home screen tiles and buttons, scrolls past "Go to my forms" then returns to it and clicks it**

**"I go to the top of the page, so I've got "Active" and "Complete" so I click on the "Start a statement" button"**

**"I just clicked on "Start my statement" and it asked me what I want to do. I've got some radio buttons here." User is scrolling through options. "What was I supposed to do, I forgot." User is going through statement options. "I gotta tell you, I don't exactly see "start a new claim here". It's also reading everything to me twice, which is kinda annoying." User selects "What I want to do isn't listed here."**

### If the user gets lost...

On a path that isn't fully built out and is stuck, you can offer the 'Apple' button at the top to jump them to the forms section of the app.


### Watch for:
- How the user gets to forms. Do they click anything other than "Go to Forms"? Y/N

 - If Y, where do they go instead?

- Does the user mentions any confusion on where to go to start a new statement. Y/N

 - If Y, what do they find confusing?

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Did the user understand the 'Submit a statement in support of a claim' introductory screen? Y/N

 - Did the user comment on this screen?

- What option did the user select on the 'What would you like to do here?' screen?

  - Did the user share any confusion about the options provided?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the form from your [assistive tech/device]?
**Unclear because I think - I don't knnow, if I"m starting a new claim, there should just be a link that says "I'm starting a new claim" and not "What I want to do isn't listed here" becuases that's just unclear**

- How confident do you feel that you're in the right place to submit your statement?
**About 50/50**

- Before you start the form itself, what do you expect this form completion process to be like?
**Well if I have to type on here; difficult**

## Task 3: Fill out the form [never back out or reload the page]
As you go through this form I'll ask that you please fill it out using fake details so you don't share your personal information with me. 

**For screen magnifier participants:**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] First, I'd like to confirm "What is on your screen now? 

Thank you.

You may continue on with the form.

**User selects first form field, puts initial in first name. Autocompletes last name, opens Month picker and says "it's too much information" and they can't tell where the form is. If you're going to give the month and day and year in spearate fields, you don't need to tell me ahead of time" There's a lot of information here, why do I need an example (while filling out day), I'm clicking on day and of course the example is giving me "January 1" and blah blah blah. When I clicked on the month, it popped up with the list and now I"m trying to click on day but I"m getting an error. And now it's repeating it again and I have to listen to all that twice. See, now I went to year and I guess I'm typing a year? Which I did" User is moving between date fields, specifically focusing on "day. "It was dificult to get that box to activate because it's reading e the entire date and example overa nd over and over again and I can't tell I'm in the box until the end, and then I know the box is active and I can go to the keyboard. If you want the day, I shouldn't be listening to the whole date over and over and over again.**

**"So i hit continue and went to the next screen so I'll see what's going on here. So that's annoying because SSN are a number field so the keyboard should be all numbers (the keyboard is numbers and symbols, not just numbers like when filling out year). Now I have no idea how many numbers I entered either whic is annoying. Usually when I fill out my social, it automatically takes me to the next section (three numbers, two, four). This is too difficult and too confusing." I realized you got this field set up so people have to enter dashes, if you're blind like me, the less you have to type, the better off I am."**

### Watch for:
- Does the user encounter any errors when entering the data into the form fields? Y/N

 - If Y, what field do they encounter errors on?

 - What triggered the error specifically?

 - Does the user understand how to correct the error? 

- Does the user experience any difficulty completing the fields from their mobile device Y/N

 - If Y, what specific challenges did they experience?

 - How did the user troubleshoot these challenges?

- Does the user express thoughts of frustration while completing the form? Y/N

 - If Y, what did they experience when expressing the frustration?


## Task 4: (After SSN before 'Continue') take a break in filling out the form
At this point, I'm going to have you pretend that you need to step away from the form for an extended period of time, you can leave the form now and go back to the homepage of the mobile app. 

**user is scrolling through selection options to return to app. "So here we go...the only thing that makes any sense to me is the "back" button, which I would prefer not to have to get every time to get back to the start. I'm on step 3 of 6 but I'm not seeing anything that takes me back to the beginning, I'm only seeing this." User clicks back to previous page multiple times until they end up on very first page "submit a statement in support" - "Is this where you wanted me to be?" "Here's another thing, and I don't know if this is testglight or my [hone, I'm not getting the navigation buttons that would normally be there in chrome, but that's not just you, that's a lot - that bar doesn't stay where it's supposed to a lot of the time, at least not for me." User clicked "Done". "I hope that was right, I clicked "done". For me personally, that was really complicated. I have to admit, I have a laptop and if I had to do this on the iPhone, I have a wireless keyboard and I'd hook that up.**

**User asked if they were in the right place (homepage), and they hadn't landed on it yet. "Back to back, what does that mean?" User returned to homepage through back button. "I think I'm there"**

### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- What does the user do to leave the form?

- Does the user express doubt that their work will be saved? Y/N


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the homepage of the app from the partially completed form [screen reader/assistive tech/device]?

**Terrible. Firstly, I don't want to have to keep hitting a backlink and hit page by page, I need a link that stays at the top part of the header and I can jujst hit that. I tcan just say VA Home. I also saw at some place "Save now and continue later" and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to hit that or not.**

- How confident do you feel that your work will be saved?
**Not at all. I might have heard some place but with voiceover, you're hearing a lot of information and I just find myself tuning out a lot of it but it's anoying. ON the computer, I can shut it up (voiceover) a lot easier, on the phone it's not as easy. That's not you, that's an Apple thing.**


## Task 5: Continue completing the started form and submit
Now, pretend you are ready to come back to your previous form. 

Please locate your previous form and continue on.

**So I went to claims...oh that's really annoying. I do not think I'm in the right place. (user stopped screensharing accidentally) "I don't know if it's Apple or me but I have a hard time with the app switcher these days." User returns to claims and is going through "Claims history" and "Claim letters" to find how to return to form. Okay so this is not hte easiest thing to navigate here because when I'm swiping (through claim letters)...at this point, I'm really not sure where my form is anymore. (if they coudn't find their form): "I would go back to the beginning and go back to forms" I just seem to be on the befits page but I don't see any forms anymore. Otherwise, I don't see anything to take me back to where I was (user is on the Benefits page). And then it skips down to health, benefits, and payments so the only thing I can think to do here is skip down to benefits. Oh I'm not, I'm not seeing anything here about forms. I'm not sure what to do now. (if they couldn't locate the forms): I'd probably start all over again. Close the whole thing and start all over again.**

**When I'm on this page (benefits), this is different than what it would be if I was onmy laptop because at the top of my page on my laptop, everything would stay on my header. on iPhone I'd have menu at the top...here I don't see anything to help me get out of here. I'm just kinda stuck.**

**I'd close out of here and sstart over.**

**User closes and reopens VA app to restart form. This apple button (at the top), this wouldn't possibly be a menu button, would it?...User navigated to "go to my forms"..."I'm clicking "Start a statement" again. I'm reading the screen again." User is scrolling through initial page down to "Start a statement". "I sometimes swithc over to the (roller?) to get me places faster." User is scrolling through submit a statement options. "so I'm just listening to this menu, this is voiceover and I don't know if you guys have control over this but I don't know it's a radio button until the end...so let's say it's not the one I want, if I go to the next one, it reads it all over again but doesn't say radio button again at the end.**

**"So I'm down to "what I want to do isn't listed here", so I have "What I awnt to do isn't listed here" and "continue" and I don't know which of these...(on personal information page) So I'm back to where I start the form all over again." User is filling out name fields...moves to date fields. "I had to listen to all that twice to find out a put a five because when I added that, it said "error" to me. Just so you know, when you're in voiceover, that little flag that popus up and says "error" to me, which makesme think I"m doing something wrong even though I'm not.**

**On last name field: "So I'm having a little trouble here becauswe I doidn't put anything in the Last Name field and when I swipe right it says "last name" then "start" and then "please enter a last name" and then I'm in the field finally. I hope you realize how annoying that would be.**

 **On Identification information screen: "I'm not talking because I gotta listen to what voiceover is actually telling me. So you know I just counted those out in my head (SSN digits)." User moves down to finish application later button then back up to SSN field. "So I'm confused ehre because it says to enter a SSN number or VA file number but it seems like you have to do both." User deletes one digit from SSN number field then, scrolsl down to "Contineu" and clicks it.**

**"So all i hear is "error" and I don't knikow if it's because I left that other field blank or if I had too manyh digits. I would make it so that nobody could enter more digits than necessary." User is on Maling Address screen. "I was looking around there because typically because I"m in your app, in chrome most of this stuff autofills for me...it did, from my keyboard now give me an autofill from my keyboard, which I wish it had done earlier so I didn't have to type all this stuff. Oh, there it is, I didn't have to type, just activate the field. And this is another thing and maybe somebody know because I don't do this as often, when I swipe to the next field and I double tap to activate the field, on the computer I don't have to do that." Jamie helped with form control. User is filling out city and state: "I'm having some trouble with voiceover because it's not...this is an iPhone thing, it keeps changing my volume. I can't hear what I'm doing." User fills out postal code by typing, then scrolsl down to "continue" button.**

**"I hope the guys are getting this and I niow part of it's just me but it's a challenge on a phone and part of it is just a one finger typing, but it's a challenge. I probably wouldn't do this on a phone." User is filling out phone number field with keyboard, then email field with keyboard, was able to use autocomplete to finish email. User moves on to "provide your statement" screen, fills out statement, and then continues to "Review and submit" screen. "So once I hear on a review page, but it's, I"m not hearing what I actually typed in, I'm hearing buttons for each sections and I'm also gonna tell you, these wizard kind of pages here are not fun to fill out here so why dont we put all this on one page because it's not fun finding out the "continue" button each time. That would be a major suggestion from me.**

**User continues to "Your full name" field. "If i touch in the wrong place, it takes me out of the form field and I have to read all this again. And I did not hear a checkbox when I was doing that. I read that twice to hear it was a checkbox but I didn't even hear it say it was. This is another thing, it keeps saying "save this...whatever" and I get that you do the wizard thing it saves it but that feature isn't worth this much aggravation. It's probably good once you get to where you wanna put what you want to tell the VA but all the other stuff...you know. Now this is where I don't like this, I don't know what my full name is. (filling out full name) So you know, what it's doing here, it was reading the sattement of truth and I'm impatient and if I tapped, I wouldn't have known the name was at the end there. (User's phone autocorrected name as they were typing and they had to swithc it back).**

**User filled out full name field and is scrolling to checkbox to select it. User selected check box and then submitted form.**

### Watch for:

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user understand that they are continuing with the same form they started at the beginning of the session? Y/N

 - If no, what do they mention that is confusing?

- Is the user able to complete the started form? Y/N

 - If no, what prohibited them from submitting the initial form?


### Observation points for screen reader users:

- Does the participant navigate linearly or jump between sections?
  
- How do they orient themselves when they lose focus?
  
- Do they use heading navigation, landmarks, or other AT-specific features?
  

### Questions for screen magnifier users:

- Are you able to percieve the full form field labels and any error messages?
  
- Do you need to scroll horizontally to see all content?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience filling out the form from the mobile app using your [assistive tech/device]? **It wasn't great and I prefer name, SSN, I prefer that to be on one page so I can use the auto feature on my feature. The less "continue" buttons, the better because it's another thing we have to work for. Remember everytime we do anything, it's a lot of stuff to listen to.**

- Were there any fields where your assistive technology didn't work as expected?

**Well voiceover works but it tends to and I don't know there may be settins here for verbosotiy a person could change but it's reading a lot of information twice, it's saying name and name again, and edit box if it's an actual edit box and you can get over it the first time...but also, if you actually do have multiple, like a label tag or a place marker, if you're using both of those, unless you're putting something in there in teh exact order it has to be. It's just redundant. Also, on your menus, it's reading it twice so if I swipe twice...and here again, the more you have to listen to voiceover talk, it's just...I'm grateful we have it but it can be very annoying how it works sometimes.**

- What worked well for you?

**Well it, um, I don't think anything here didn't work, a part of it is me because like I said, I don't like to do forms on my phone so I don't actually know how much of this developers could change and chow much is an iPhone thing, if I hd a keyboard hooke up to it i could get through it easier....I have test typing turned on where I press a letter and it enters it in there for me...it's not like a regular keyboard so it's a lot slower process for me. I use dictation a lot on my phone. Which I probably couldn've used but I didn't want to do it since we were on this call.**

- What was unclear for you?

**I know I guess after I hit continue it probab ly did an autosave but that didn 't, that'snot all that important, if it was on one page it would be easier....it was very unclear, again, if you want to get me back home to the page, there should be something up top so I can get back to home from any page**

- How does this compare to filling out forms on VA.gov or other websites?
**Most of the time, if yo'ure on a normal web page, we don't have this wizard thing so everything just stays on that screen, you know? You can see everything you put it, it's just like, when  I had to sign it, I couldn't remember what I had to type. Let's just say if I was signing the form and it didin't like it, I could go back up the screen. Otherwise I have to go back, back, back...if I'm on the review and sign page if everhthing was there so I could read it**

- What would make this process feel familiar to you?

**It didn't feel unfamiliar, a lot of it is just the way forms are on a small screen device.**

- If you had to take breaks, where would there be natural stopping points?

**Between name, address, phone number, probably even the SSN number would just be one screen. If I was on a web page, probably what I was going to tell you about it would bne on one screen too. Here, if I had to sign in, it would probably time me out. If you're just on a regular form field, let's see I was siginng up for something on the internet, there's no time outs, I could come back and continue and it wouldn't matter.**

**when I'm filling out this form, I have the rotor set on form fields...it would be better...if return to home was a button, it would have told me that and I could've just tapped that.**

**(on done button) see this is a problem, it was like that before...if there's a lot of white space that my screen, the voiceover, thinks there's words there, it was like when we first started and I had to swipe back because I didn't notice there was a button there...if I keep swiping enough I finally get up there.**

 
## Task 6: View submitted form
Now that you have completed the form, please go back to the app.


### Questions for testing participant: 
- Based on what you see now, how do you know the form was submitted?

**I think there was a menu item there...first of all, it told me it was submitted when I did but if I went back, I'm sure I saw something about something in progress**

- What does this status mean to you?
**That I've submitted something but it hasn't been ruled on yet or whatever but I can at least tell it's submitted**

- If you needed to reference this form submission in a phone call with VA, what information would you look for?
**I'm sure there was a claim number there that was generated somewhere there that they would ask me for**

- What would you expect to see if you needed to check on your submission later?
**Well if it was what the status of it is, whether it says "pending review" or something like that**

- How would you expect to be notified of updates to this form?
**It would be an email**


### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user express confidence that they have completed and submitted their form?

 - If no, what is confusing to them and why?

- Does the user understand the status of the form?

 - If not, what do confusion do they express when interpretting the form status?


### Deleting the testing app:
Now that we have completed the study today I'm going to assist you with deleting the VA testing app from your device. 

**iOS users:** 
If you navigate to your device home screen, and engage the menu screen of the VA testing app we used today select 'Delete app'. Remove from device.

**Android users:***

1. We now need to ensure you turn off the developer options we turned on for the test from the "Google Play Store".
2. Navigate back to ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
3. Select ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù
4. Go back to the main phone home screen, lower menu bar select square in the middle.
5. Swipe up to remove Google Play Store window
6. Now go back to the main screen, open the ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
7. Click on your name in the top right 
8. Settings > General > Click on the ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù > Toggle off ‚ÄúInternal app sharing‚Äù
9. Go to settings on phone > scroll to bottom > click on developer options > Toggle on top for on/off > Toggle off (it will obscure the screen because of screen share)
10. Go back one, there should be no developer mode.
11. Reinstall the VA app

(hint: to switch browser windows the user can select the three lines III in the bottom left corner of their lower nav. menu)

## Thank You and Closing - 3 minutes

- How was this process overall for you?
**I'm happy to help**

- Was there anything you would change about this process?
**Nothing you can really change, zoom has its quirks and iPhone has its quirks**

- What parts required the most concentration?
**The filling out the form because I have to listen - if I don't listen to everyhthing it tells me, which sometimes I don't, and I don't think there's anything you can do, I wish sometimes it could say "form field"...because then I could double tap and go about my business...the shorter the label tag, the  better. We have to listen to the whole thing before we know we're on a form field.**

- Do you feel you would like to complete forms using the mobile app in the future? Why or why not?
**Honestly I wouldn't use it if I didn't have to but I have a laptop and a regular keyb oard I could type on. It's more the typing than anything else for me...for me it's just typing, trying to touch type on this screen. I coudlnt' imagine having to type out paragraphs on this screen...with voiceover, it's really a touch, you gotta listen for a letter, do something with the letter, go to the next letter. It's a slow process, at least for me...I always fall back to my laptop. But I use my iPhone all the time for different things but I use dictate a lot. If that gets better that would be fine, it would be better talk than type and that would be easier for me. Dictaiton is good but it's not quite there yet.**


**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** 
**Participant confirmed yes**
