# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Christine**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes **Notetaker First Name** and our accessibility specialist **AT Specialist First Name** will be on the call available to provide support with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology should you need it.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out forms from the VA mobile app. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using the VA Health & Benefits App. As you go through these steps please speak aloud your thoughts and actions to help us understand more about your experience.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing an app to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I‚Äôve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don‚Äôt link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.
 
**Participant confirmed yes**

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
 
**Participant confirmed yes**
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No

**Participant confirmed yes**

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

**Note for all users: You'll be interacting with a demo prototype today.** Since it's a demo, note that none of your actions will affect your own VA information or benefits.


## Task 1: Login to the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
[start on the VA Health and Benefits mobile app version: 2.59.1 (3031) for iOS]

I'd like you to take a look at this screen, and sign in.

[When they get to the homepage:] Any data used throughout this test is not your real data or connected to your VA account in any way. This is a test environment with artifical testing data displayed only. 

**For screen magnifier participants.**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] "What is on your screen now?

**Participant has magnifier turned on, looking at home screen activity tiles**

Are you seeing the participants screen magnified at all? 

If not, ask the participant to check their settings on their device by navigating to...

1. Settings
2. Accessibility
3. Zoom
4. Show while mirroring toggle on



## Task 2: Start a statement
As we go through the steps in this study, please talk aloud about what you're thinking BEFORE clicking on anything.

Today I'd like you to pretend that you need to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself using the VA Health & Benefits Mobile App. 

### Question for testing participant:

- Before we start, what do you expect this process to be like?

**I expect it to be filling out a form, it's gonna ask me a bunch of question about hwwat happened and what I"m expericing and probably ask me what kind of supporting documents I have**
  
Thank you for sharing that, You may begin the task to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself.

*Allow the user to navigate to and through the form on their own without guiding them through the happy path. 

**Participant goes to Claims and scrolls through Claims history, then returns to Claims, goes to Claims letters, then navigates to Benefits. "I would guess it would be under claims but I don't see where you can file a new claim". Participant returns to home screen and is scrolling through it, then clicks on "Go to my forms", returns to home page.**

### If the user gets lost...

On a path that isn't fully built out and is stuck, you can offer the 'Apple' button at the top to jump them to the forms section of the app.

**Moderator helps participant to click "Apple" at top of page. on the Forms page: "OH, start a statement, guess I should have read all the way to the bottom fo the page."**

**Participant is scrolling through Submit a statement intro page, clicks "Submit a statement". On the "What would you like to do?" screen, asks, "So I'm starting a new claim?" Participant scrolls through options and selects "What I want to do isn't listed here.**


### Watch for:
- How the user gets to forms. Do they click anything other than "Go to Forms"? Y/N

 - If Y, where do they go instead?

- Does the user mentions any confusion on where to go to start a new statement. Y/N

 - If Y, what do they find confusing?

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Did the user understand the 'Submit a statement in support of a claim' introductory screen? Y/N

 - Did the user comment on this screen?

- What option did the user select on the 'What would you like to do here?' screen?

  - Did the user share any confusion about the options provided?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the form from your [assistive tech/device]?
**Um, it was good, can you see when I use the magnifier?... **

- How confident do you feel that you're in the right place to submit your statement?
**Not very...one thing about the VA is if you don't do something in the right place, they'll make you feel silly...**

- Before you start the form itself, what do you expect this form completion process to be like?
- **Um, I think it appears to be very simple and straightforward so I'm going to say this first page looks like it's going to be very easy. From past experience, as long as I'm doing the right form and the right thing it's very simple and straightforward to do unless you find out it's not the right form...**


## Task 3: Fill out the form [never back out or reload the page]
As you go through this form I'll ask that you please fill it out using fake details so you don't share your personal information with me. 

**For screen magnifier participants:**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] First, I'd like to confirm "What is on your screen now? 

Thank you.

You may continue on with the form.

**Participant fills out name and date of birth fields, clicks continue. (Participant is using physical keyboard). Participant fills out social security number and clicks continue.**

### Watch for:
- Does the user encounter any errors when entering the data into the form fields? Y/N

 - If Y, what field do they encounter errors on?

 - What triggered the error specifically?

 - Does the user understand how to correct the error? 

- Does the user experience any difficulty completing the fields from their mobile device Y/N

 - If Y, what specific challenges did they experience?

 - How did the user troubleshoot these challenges?

- Does the user express thoughts of frustration while completing the form? Y/N

 - If Y, what did they experience when expressing the frustration?


## Task 4: (After SSN before 'Continue') take a break in filling out the form
At this point, I'm going to have you pretend that you need to step away from the form for an extended period of time, you can leave the form now and go back to the homepage of the mobile app. 

**"So you want me to save....correct? I would go to "finish this application later. Participant clicks done in top left, then home. **

### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- What does the user do to leave the form?

- Does the user express doubt that their work will be saved? Y/N


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the homepage of the app from the partially completed form [screen reader/assistive tech/device]?
**It was easy, I know outside the app you look for done button, usually up in the left hand corner from what I remember, then go to the navigation and click the home button**

- How confident do you feel that your work will be saved?
**Um, very, very confident**



## Task 5: Continue completing the started form and submit
Now, pretend you are ready to come back to your previous form. 

Please locate your previous form and continue on.
**Partiicpant clicks on claims to return to form. Clicks on "Apple" shortcut at the top. Clicks on "Active" and then clicks on claim to open. "I thought the form would be under claim" "I have to scroll to (fit everything on the screen)." Participant is filling out address fields, scrolls through to check all fields are filled out, then clicks continue.**

**Participant continues to contact info screen and fills out phone number and email, checks fields are filled out, clicks continue. Participant continues to provide a statement page. Participant continues to Review and submit.**

**Participant looks through first section with name and Date of birth. Participant keeps scrolling back and forth through the page, eventually selects "Your full name" field in "Statement of truth" section. Participant submits the application**

### Watch for:

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user understand that they are continuing with the same form they started at the beginning of the session? Y/N

 - If no, what do they mention that is confusing?

- Is the user able to complete the started form? Y/N

 - If no, what prohibited them from submitting the initial form?


### Observation points for screen reader users:

- Does the participant navigate linearly or jump between sections?
  
- How do they orient themselves when they lose focus?
  
- Do they use heading navigation, landmarks, or other AT-specific features?
  

### Questions for screen magnifier users:

- Are you able to percieve the full form field labels and any error messages?
  
- Do you need to scroll horizontally to see all content?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience filling out the form from the mobile app using your [assistive tech/device]?
**It was good, like I said I think from the beginning, I got fumble fingers or whatever you call so sometimes I get on the wrong thing or scroll the wrong way but other than that using the magnifier was easy.** 

- Were there any fields where your assistive technology didn't work as expected?
**no, not at all**

- What worked well for you?
**the form process, everything went well, with the magnifier it was very easy to read, I could find, I could read through it, my go-to when I go to a page is I scroll through the whole page so I can get a feel for it and I'll turn the magnifier off and fill out the form. Sometimes when I'm on the form, there's things all over the place...sometimes my mouse...will take me to where I don't need to be. (participant turns off magnifier when filling out form**

- What was unclear for you?
**no, it was easy to comprehend**

- How does this compare to filling out forms on VA.gov or other websites?
**um, as far as filling the form out compared to the website I'm going to say it was exactly the same, going with other websites, a whole lot easier. some websites get really confusing, um, on what they're asking for, so. no, easy, very straightforward**

- What would make this process feel familiar to you?
**hm, I don't know. I don't fill out a lot of forms on the VA website anymore...being familiar with going in and understanding what it's asking for. I mean with any VA form it's the same information that they want.**

- If you had to take breaks, where would there be natural stopping points?
**At the end of each page, um, where you can stop and save it, that's kinda my natural spot. That's what I do, the information on each one of the pages was very short and concise so it wasn't like you had to be on that page for any length of time and that made it very convenient. I know if I"m filling out along form and I have to pause, sometimes you have to fill out the form before saving and that's really frustrating. I like that you can take a break, especially with me having a very short attention span.**

 
## Task 6: View submitted form
Now that you have completed the form, please go back to the app.
**Partiicpant clicks "done" to return to app, clicks home to return to home screen.** 

**"I suspect my form would be under claims, under active claims...I"m going to say that that would not be the right place to be." I would think logically, it would be under claims." Participant checks inbox..."I imagine I'd see a message that says you successfully submitted your claim". Participant hit Apple button to return to forms.**

### Questions for testing participant: 
- Based on what you see now, how do you know the form was submitted?
**"I- now you see, that says draft." Participant opens form again, then returns to app."Form updated successfully...um, I don't know."**

- What does this status mean to you?
**OKay, so now it says in progress...okay, so I would say it was in progress, so I know it was submitted**

- If you needed to reference this form submission in a phone call with VA, what information would you look for?
**I guess I would, I would - probably the form number and then the date I submitted it. And - hmmm, they usually give you a reference number if I'm not mistaken...so**

- What would you expect to see if you needed to check on your submission later?
**Um, if I wanted to check on it later, I would check my messages first cause like I said usually when I've submitted forms in the past, you get a message. And then if you go to your - (Participant goes to claims) see I keep wanting to go to your claims history cause I keep thinking it'll show you submitted your form and show you a status update. I'm trying to go back off (Participant keeps moving between claims, beneifts, and claims history)...and whatever the status...yeah, I would check the claims, if not, I don't know here I would go then. If not, I would sit back and wait patiently because I know sometimes it takes a couple days for it to be reviewed.**

- How would you expect to be notified of updates to this form?
**I have email, push, and text notifications turned on on all my devices so I would expect one of those to let me know. I must say, they're very good at keeping you updated on what's going on "Hey, we've got your thing" or "hey this guy's reviewing it"...I think the communication o the VA part has been very good on keeping you updated.**



### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user express confidence that they have completed and submitted their form?

 - If no, what is confusing to them and why?

- Does the user understand the status of the form?

 - If not, what do confusion do they express when interpretting the form status?


### Deleting the testing app:
Now that we have completed the study today I'm going to assist you with deleting the VA testing app from your device. 

**iOS users:** 
If you navigate to your device home screen, and engage the menu screen of the VA testing app we used today select 'Delete app'. Remove from device.

**Android users:***

1. We now need to ensure you turn off the developer options we turned on for the test from the "Google Play Store".
2. Navigate back to ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
3. Select ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù
4. Go back to the main phone home screen, lower menu bar select square in the middle.
5. Swipe up to remove Google Play Store window
6. Now go back to the main screen, open the ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
7. Click on your name in the top right 
8. Settings > General > Click on the ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù > Toggle off ‚ÄúInternal app sharing‚Äù
9. Go to settings on phone > scroll to bottom > click on developer options > Toggle on top for on/off > Toggle off (it will obscure the screen because of screen share)
10. Go back one, there should be no developer mode.
11. Reinstall the VA app

(hint: to switch browser windows the user can select the three lines III in the bottom left corner of their lower nav. menu)

## Thank You and Closing - 3 minutes

- How was this process overall for you?
**Um, very easy. Um, yeah it was very easy. A little, a little, a little bit of anxiety just for the fact that there's a lot you watching me do this and I didn't want to feel stupid. but overall experience was very good.**

- Was there anything you would change about this process?
**No, not at all. very easy.**

- What parts required the most concentration?
**No, I mean, there wasn't really any part of it that I needed to have a lot of concentration because I do like using the app, I think any concentration was just because like I said of everyone watching me.**

- Do you feel you would like to complete forms using the mobile app in the future? Why or why not?
**Yes, it always, to me it feels, if you're filling out a form within an app it's more clear as far as how the form is laid out, um, if you're on a website there seems to be a lot of extra stuff, junk, that doesn't pertain to it. I use the screen magnifier on my computer as well and a lot of websites where you're filling out forms...usually on an app where I have it set up if the top half is magnified so I can see where the form starts and ends...it's well laid out, there's not a lot of stuff going on. Filling out forms in the app is a lot easier than on the website.**


**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** 
- *(yes / no)*
**Participant confirmed yes**
  
- *(If participant says yes)* Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today**. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide. 

If you know any other Veterans or family members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
