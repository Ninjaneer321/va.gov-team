# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Christine**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes **Notetaker First Name** and our accessibility specialist **AT Specialist First Name** will be on the call available to provide support with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology should you need it.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?** 
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out forms from the VA mobile app. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using the VA Health & Benefits App. As you go through these steps please speak aloud your thoughts and actions to help us understand more about your experience.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing an app to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I‚Äôve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don‚Äôt link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let‚Äôs start with a few questions... 

1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right? "Yes, Ma'am..."

# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your whole screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

**Note for all users: You'll be interacting with a demo prototype today.** Since it's a demo, note that none of your actions will affect your own VA information or benefits.


## Task 1: Login to the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
[start on the VA Health and Benefits mobile app version: 2.59.1 (3031) for iOS]

I'd like you to take a look at this screen, and sign in.

[When they get to the homepage:] Any data used throughout this test is not your real data or connected to your VA account in any way. This is a test environment with artifical testing data displayed only. 

**For screen magnifier participants.**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] "What is on your screen now? "At the top...It says talk to the Veteran crisis line, I don't need that, I can see my profile icon...I see upcoming appoitments...past appointments 5, eligible for travel...and go to my forms, I'm just scrolling down down...Coast Gaurd! Nothing against them but I'm not Coast Guard..." 

Are you seeing the participants screen magnified at all? "Yes" 

If not, ask the participant to check their settings on their device by navigating to...

1. Settings
2. Accessibility
3. Zoom
4. Show while mirroring toggle on



## Task 2: Start a statement
As we go through the steps in this study, please talk aloud about what you're thinking BEFORE clicking on anything.

Today I'd like you to pretend that you need to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself using the VA Health & Benefits Mobile App. 

### Question for testing participant:

- Before we start, what do you expect this process to be like?
  

Thank you for sharing that, You may begin the task to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself.

*Allow the user to navigate to and through the form on their own without guiding them through the happy path. 

### If the user gets lost...

On a path that isn't fully built out and is stuck, you can offer the 'Apple' button at the top to jump them to the forms section of the app.


### Watch for:
- How the user gets to forms. Do they click anything other than "Go to Forms"? Y/**N** "Contact us, I like that one..." "The blue here's telling you what's active..." "I think I would go to my forms..." "I would hit this VA contact us...cause they would tell me what form I would need...and I can't tell you for the form number off the top of my head.." "You can have active claims that are already...approved or disapproved and you view from there..." "Not knowing the form number I would call them, get the form number, and then [go to forms]." 

 - If Y, where do they go instead?

- Does the user mentions any confusion on where to go to start a new statement. **Y**/N "I can start a statement" (hits button, goes to GH portal) 

 - If Y, what do they find confusing?

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion? 

- Did the user understand the 'Submit a statement in support of a claim' introductory screen? Y/N

 - Did the user comment on this screen? Yes, (user reads content out loud) "...Okay, start your statement..."  

- What option did the user select on the 'What would you like to do here?' screen? (user reading through options silently and then out loud) "I have new evidence...I want to make sure I'm selecting the right one...a new claim..." (reads radio button options out loud) "...A new claim..." (reads radio button options out loud again) "...I want to requset my personal record, that's a new one...can I touch one?" "Need help, oh I like the need help!" "...What I want to do isn't listed here...all those other ones look like you have a claim in...that's not putting in a claim...for me I would hit that last one...if I had any questions I would call that 1800 number they have there.." 

  - Did the user share any confusion about the options provided?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the form from your iPad? "I had to magnify the list bigger at the beginning...it helps me to see and not miss a word...I have no peripheral either...helps me not miss"  

- How confident do you feel that you're in the right place to submit your statement? "They want my name, date...I know I'm good there...I feel I'm in the right place to start a new claim, they're asking about me and they're going to have more information that they want to know" "I hope I'm answering your questiosn correctly" 

- Before you start the form itself, what do you expect this form completion process to be like? "...they're going to have a space in there about what I want to request with additional documents to support my claim on the following pages, following this name section..."


## Task 3: Fill out the form [never back out or reload the page]
As you go through this form I'll ask that you please fill it out using fake details so you don't share your personal information with me. 

**For screen magnifier participants:**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] First, I'd like to confirm "What is on your screen now? 

Thank you.

You may continue on with the form.

### Watch for:
- Does the user encounter any errors when entering the data into the form fields? **Y**/N

 - If Y, what field do they encounter errors on? Date field, day 

 - What triggered the error specifically? February 28th didn't pass data validation based on year entered

 - Does the user understand how to correct the error? Changed day to 28

- Does the user experience any difficulty completing the fields from their mobile device Y/**N**

 - If Y, what specific challenges did they experience?

 - How did the user troubleshoot these challenges? 

- Does the user express thoughts of frustration while completing the form? Y/N

 - If Y, what did they experience when expressing the frustration?


## Task 4: (After SSN before 'Continue') take a break in filling out the form
At this point, I'm going to have you pretend that you need to step away from the form for an extended period of time, you can leave the form now and go back to the homepage of the mobile app. 


### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen? 

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- What does the user do to leave the form? "I hit done, and I'm done...I have to go to the homepage"

- Does the user express doubt that their work will be saved? **Y**/N "...They're gonna say what's up with this, it's an imcomplete form..." 


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the homepage of the app from the partially completed form [screen reader/assistive tech/device]? "I would've been easier to just hit the home icon [after pressing done]...my mind is saying, you might have to do the whole form again"

- How confident do you feel that your work will be saved? "They said they'd save if for 30 days...but it was an incomplete form...so I'd say they would discard it, I'm saying I'd have to start over...go back to the form to see if my information is still on there...it said finish form later, I remember seeing that option" 



## Task 5: Continue completing the started form and submit
Now, pretend you are ready to come back to your previous form. 

Please locate your previous form and continue on.


### Watch for:

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen? 

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion? (Scans page, goes to my forms)

- Does the user understand that they are continuing with the same form they started at the beginning of the session? Y/N

 - If no, what do they mention that is confusing? "That's it right here I think...let's see if that's it...I may be going to the wrong place here..." "Oh it saved my information, that's good" 

- Is the user able to complete the started form? Y/N "I don't have a VA file number...I'm going to hit the continue...It's not letting me go any further...I don't know if it needs a file number in there..." (prompted to hit continue again) "Went to page three now..." (user reading content aloud, clarifies what they should be filling out) "I hit continue...At the end it always says, "Finish this..." and I can hit that if I need to stop?" (Christine provides clarity) "Okay, I'm going to hit continue...(enters info)...okay Imma hit continue again..." (user reading content aloud, user rubbing head and thinking about what to enter while vocalizing) "Imma put anything I way, I'll put..." (user filling out field) "They're probably going to want to know more information about..." (user continues writing in open text field) "...let's keep on going..." (user reading their entry, laughs, and proceeds) "Imma hit continue" "I hope I'm being a good patient here!" (reassured) (user reading through expanding menu labels, expands section) "Why isn't it showing my name, it says to review and submit..." (User keeps scanning for information) "Oh oh, it is showing me‚Äîit's on the end. This is me, correct...correct...that looks good...okay okay, all that's correct...okay..." (user reads satement of truth disclaimmer aloud, confirms is safe to submit, keeps reading aloud) "How many people who are Veterans you think read this policy in a new tab?" (Christine clarifies for study) "I don't think nobody does! That's my personal opinion though, that's how you get stuck...by not finishing it all" (User reads certification aloud, hits submit, user reading from top of page aloud) "Form submitted started on 10/02/2025...is in progress, can take up to 30 days..." (continues reading aloud down page) "I can print the form if I want to..." 

 - If no, what prohibited them from submitting the initial form?


### Observation points for screen reader users:

- Does the participant navigate linearly or jump between sections?
  
- How do they orient themselves when they lose focus?
  
- Do they use heading navigation, landmarks, or other AT-specific features?
  

### Questions for screen magnifier users:

- Are you able to percieve the full form field labels and any error messages? -> 
  
- Do you need to scroll horizontally to see all content? (User is confused by the vocabulary "labels", asks for clarity) "I'm not completely understanding what you're asking...magnifying in order to read it, yes..." "If I don't scroll over all that I see is [truncated content]...unless I scroll over then I can see...understand the whole question." 


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience filling out the form from the mobile app using your [assistive tech/device]? "I wouldn't be able to do it without the magnifier...I can see the dark letters but can't read what it is...I know there's something underneath it but I can't see it...I couldn't fill it out without the magnifier...even when I'm filling it out my wife is sitting right here by my side doing it with me."  

- Were there any fields where your assistive technology didn't work as expected? "No...pretty good...except for that one page...I couldn't magnify it, before we got to fill out the form." "I remeber seeing an arrow in a box at the...then underneath one was in green I think...I couldn't magnify that."  

- What worked well for you? "Everything worked well dealing with the magnification...what wasn't working 100% was me making sure I could do these to help you understand what I was trying to understand...trying to relate to you that what I was doing was right...[I wanted to make sure I was helping people who might also user magnification)]...to make sure they're able to fill out forms and..." 

- What was unclear for you? "For me as long as evertything I need‚Äînow just to share with you to share the page as we did...I never had to go through as much as we did...forgive me, I forgot what I was saying...I hate when I do that" (Christine provides reassurance, helps clarify the question) "...it helps you continue that helps you a lot...doing this whole cycle I did understand...either way it saved it...being able to magnify enough to read it...no big problem that I could recollect right now." 

- How does this compare to filling out forms on VA.gov or other websites? "I don't fill out forms, I haven't filled out any that I could even recollect...like I said, we've been married a long time...I don't order anything, I tell here what I need and she orders it...she fills all that out, that makes me kind of dependent on her doens't it." "I don't want to get on the page and do something wrong" "She cooks, she cleans, she does everything for me." (Christine provides reassurance) 

- What would make this process feel familiar to you?

- If you had to take breaks, where would there be natural stopping points?

 
## Task 6: View submitted form
Now that you have completed the form, please go back to the app.


### Questions for testing participant: 
- Based on what you see now, how do you know the form was submitted? (User navigated to claims page) "Well they don't have it unders claims...it's not an active claim yet then...it doesn't show." (user reading menu aloud) "You see this, I can use that..." (user takes our magnifying glass to read iPad, noted that they can't pinch to zoom in the app) "Let me see if it's somewhere else on here...documents and letters that's where I just went..." (user continues to search through menus to find forms) "I'm not sure where it would be...It's not under claims, I don't see it anywhere..." "1800 I'd been on the phone, [I'd tell them who I am and the date taht I submitted it and they'd be able to find it /*]..." 

- What does this status mean to you? "They'll probably put it under the active claims section of this document here and then I'll be able to see the process...it had to go to five different levels...and that showed under the claim" 

- If you needed to reference this form submission in a phone call with VA, what information would you look for?

- What would you expect to see if you needed to check on your submission later?

- How would you expect to be notified of updates to this form? "They'll send me...they'll put in the claims...they'll send you a letter...on that the process that it's going through and how long it's been there and all this other good stuff...I'll tell you I call that 1800 number a lot...but if they need more information I know they'll call me or...go to the hospital or whatever and get it checked out..." 


### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user express confidence that they have completed and submitted their form?

 - If no, what is confusing to them and why?

- Does the user understand the status of the form?

 - If not, what do confusion do they express when interpretting the form status?


### Deleting the testing app:
