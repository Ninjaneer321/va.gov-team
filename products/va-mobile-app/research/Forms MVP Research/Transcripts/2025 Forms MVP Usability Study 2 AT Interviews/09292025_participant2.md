# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Christine**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes **Notetaker First Name** and our accessibility specialist **AT Specialist First Name** will be on the call available to provide support with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology should you need it.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out forms from the VA mobile app. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using the VA Health & Benefits App. As you go through these steps please speak aloud your thoughts and actions to help us understand more about your experience.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing an app to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I‚Äôve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don‚Äôt link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.
 
**Participant confirmed yes**

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** Yes / No
 
**Participant confirmed yes**
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** Yes / No

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let‚Äôs start with a few questions... 

**P2
09/29/25
2PM EST
{Forms MVP AT Users} [Usability Study]**

1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right? 
    **Participant confirmed yes** - Thanks for confirming that.

2. What kind of device are you using today? *(Tablet / Smartphone)*
    **Apple iPhone 16 Pro** - *(If not the expected device, ask to rejoin that way)*

3. What operating system is on your device? *(iOS / Android / _______)* **iOS**

4. What is the default web browser set up on your device? *(Chrome / Firefox / Edge / Safari / _______)* **Safari**

5. What type of assistive technology are you using right now? **Text-to-speech, several times a day. I also use, in notes, there‚Äôs a microphone so I can speak whatever I need to write**

6. How many years have you been using [assistive technology]? **Since 2015**

7. When or how often do you use it? **Several times a day, also use, there‚Äôs a magnifier option. I use that too**

8. How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader/magnifier--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert? **Intermediate**

9. Have you ever shared your screen in Zoom while using a screen reader/magnifier? **Yes**

10. Have you ever filled out a VA form online before? 
   - If so, can you tell me about your most recent experience? How did it go? **Yes, I didn‚Äôt have any issues. I‚Äôm in My Healthy Vet a lot but as you know hen you go in there, sometimes you can find forms that may need toc completed online or digitally. Making submissions, uploading documents, they make it easy to do that**
  
11. Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app downloaded on your device?
   - If so, can you tell me what you use the mobile app primarily for? How has your experience been so far? **Is that the same or slightly different? I have it ,since they completed that integration I don‚Äôt use it that much to. Used to use it for logging in, I like to know what‚Äôs going on, what‚Äôs available‚Ä¶what information could b e provided. I would log on and go through pages of information and see what‚Äôs out there or what‚Äôs available and see what can help me. When I log into VA.gov, it‚Äôs a one-stop shop. Everything that I might need is right there at my fingertips. The security (on the app) sometimes it can be annoying but I understand why it needs to be there. That was probably the most aggravating part of it. Once you get past those steps, it‚Äôs easy. Even getting through those steps, it‚Äôs easy. Once you get used to doing it a few times, when you do it the first few times it was stressful. A lot of vets, especially those who are not digital natives‚Ä¶we had to learn. But even when I call myself an intermediate level. New applications, new processes and procedures, sometimes I find them a little stressful. Until I figure out how to complete what I need to complete, then the stress will diminish.**


# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your whole screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

We can help guide you through sharing your screen when you're ready if you'd like assistance. Please say what you're doing out loud so that if there are any issues, we'll know what they are.
1. Make sure that the Zoom application has focus
2. Navigate to the screen share button (may need to tap on mobile device to display the menu at the bottom, may have to scroll over to see menu options).
3. Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane
4. Activate the screen share

**(If video window is covering up phone screen)** It looks like my zoom video is covering up a lot of your screen. Could you please swipe it off? (Screen reader: swipe right until the video window has focus, and then double tap when you hear "Stash preview".)

## Task 00: Open prototype

**Note for all users: You'll be interacting with a demo prototype today.** Since it's a demo, note that none of your actions will affect your own VA information or benefits.


## Task 1: Login to the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
[start on the VA Health and Benefits mobile app version: 2.59.1 (3031) for iOS]

I'd like you to take a look at this screen, and sign in.

[When they get to the homepage:] Any data used throughout this test is not your real data or connected to your VA account in any way. This is a test environment with artifical testing data displayed only. 

**For screen magnifier participants.**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] "What is on your screen now?

Are you seeing the participants screen magnified at all? 

If not, ask the participant to check their settings on their device by navigating to...

1. Settings
2. Accessibility
3. Zoom
4. Show while mirroring toggle on



## Task 2: Start a statement
As we go through the steps in this study, please talk aloud about what you're thinking BEFORE clicking on anything.

Today I'd like you to pretend that you need to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself using the VA Health & Benefits Mobile App. 

### Question for testing participant:

- Before we start, what do you expect this process to be like?
  **Expect there to be steps about how to get this completed and I would follow those steps sequentially to get that done and submitted**
  

Thank you for sharing that, You may begin the task to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself.

*Allow the user to navigate to and through the form on their own without guiding them through the happy path. 

### If the user gets lost...

On a path that isn't fully built out and is stuck, you can offer the 'Apple' button at the top to jump them to the forms section of the app.


**Participant went to Benefits, then Claims to look for where to submit statement. Then I look for something that would let me talk to someone in IT‚Ä¶no‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the crisis line. Participant returned to home screen and scrolled past ‚ÄúGo to my forms‚Äù. Participant went to ‚Äúcontact VA‚Äù and said they would reach out to someone for help.**

**Participant clicked ‚ÄúStart a Statement‚Äù.** 

**‚ÄúThis is what I was looking for.‚Äù Participant scrolls through options. Selected I want to provide context‚Ä¶‚Äù**

**Okay so‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a message that said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a better way to submit y our statement‚Äù, based on your answer you should submit a lay or witness statement‚Ä¶I‚Äôm guessing this button here will start the statement. When it said there‚Äôs a better way, I wasn‚Äôt clear if what I was doing was or was not the best so I just proceeded with what was in front of me.**

**It‚Äôs taking a long time to load. I would give it typically three minutes and if it kept doing that, I would think something is wrong. It shouldn‚Äôt take 3, 4, 5, minutes to do it. I would try to click the ‚Äúdone‚Äù button to back out and see if that would help me. It‚Äôs loading in the application. (After a while of loading) I would think at this point it‚Äôs encountering some sort of technical difficulty, it might be glitchy. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my device because it‚Äôs not power, I‚Äôm not low operational, low capacity, low battery. I‚Äôm just gonna click done and it‚Äôs saying I don‚Äôt have any active forms so I‚Äôm going to go in and try again and see if it behaves any differently.**

**Alright, so this is back where we were before. It‚Äôs gonna take me 15 minutes to do this. I‚Äôm gonna just start the statement. The first button option‚Ä¶it seems like it could work for me‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not real clear if that‚Äôs the one I need. ‚ÄúI have new evidence to submit or open claim‚Äù. Um‚Ä¶I want to provide context or details about a claim‚Ä¶that‚Äôs the one I just tried before. I‚Äôm gonna go with ‚ÄúWhat I want to do isn‚Äôt listed here‚Äù and see what it does.**

### Watch for:
- How the user gets to forms. Do they click anything other than "Go to Forms"? Y/N

 - If Y, where do they go instead?

- Does the user mentions any confusion on where to go to start a new statement. Y/N

 - If Y, what do they find confusing?

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Did the user understand the 'Submit a statement in support of a claim' introductory screen? Y/N

 - Did the user comment on this screen?

- What option did the user select on the 'What would you like to do here?' screen?

  - Did the user share any confusion about the options provided?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the form from your [assistive tech/device]?
**I really had to depend on what was in front of me. I think only one time I had to make the screen larger. Right now I‚Äôm sitting really close to the phone so I can see although I would prefer to highlight this all and have it read everything to me. I feel the pressure of you guys sitting here and watching me do this but if I was by myself I would go through this slower.**

**How confident do you feel that you're in the right place to submit your statement?
I feel like I‚Äôm closet to being in the right place, sometimes what I read and understand to be‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶a place to be, is not where I should be. So I have to back out sometimes and reread it and make sure I understood what it said and where it was trying to take me. So if I‚Äôm not in the right place, I‚Äôm closet to being in the right place.**

- Before you start the form itself, what do you expect this form completion process to be like?
**I think it‚Äôs gonna be pretty easy, just submit a statement to support a claim and there‚Äôs 6 steps it tells me up top. So I‚Äôm on step one and it‚Äôs gonna walk me through those sequences so that‚Äôs pretty easy, just follow the prompts. So I expect it‚Äôs going to be pretty easy.**


## Task 3: Fill out the form [never back out or reload the page]
As you go through this form I'll ask that you please fill it out using fake details so you don't share your personal information with me. 

**Uses microphone to fill out fields; after Middle initial, we couldn‚Äôt‚Äô see last name being entered. Skipped to date of birth. Then quickly completed 1st page.**

**For screen magnifier participants:**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] First, I'd like to confirm "What is on your screen now? 

Thank you.

You may continue on with the form.

### Watch for:
- Does the user encounter any errors when entering the data into the form fields? Y/N

 - If Y, what field do they encounter errors on?

 - What triggered the error specifically?

 - Does the user understand how to correct the error? 

- Does the user experience any difficulty completing the fields from their mobile device Y/N

 - If Y, what specific challenges did they experience?

 - How did the user troubleshoot these challenges?

- Does the user express thoughts of frustration while completing the form? Y/N

 - If Y, what did they experience when expressing the frustration?


## Task 4: (After SSN before 'Continue') take a break in filling out the form
At this point, I'm going to have you pretend that you need to step away from the form for an extended period of time, you can leave the form now and go back to the homepage of the mobile app. 

**Looking for where to return to app‚Ä¶‚ÄùIt says that it‚Äôs been saved‚Äù‚Ä¶I‚Äôd probably jot down the ID number‚Ä¶Click on ‚Äúfinish later‚Äù and then you said go back to the home page (Partiicapnt clicked done to return)**


### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- What does the user do to leave the form?

- Does the user express doubt that their work will be saved? Y/N


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the homepage of the app from the partially completed form [screen reader/assistive tech/device]?
- **Pretty easy**

- How confident do you feel that your work will be saved?
**I feel very confident that it‚Äôll be saved. I‚Äôve never had an issue with it not being saved.**


## Task 5: Continue completing the started form and submit
Now, pretend you are ready to come back to your previous form. 

Please locate your previous form and continue on.

**Participant went to ‚ÄúClaims‚Äù to continue filling out form. Returned to home page and scrolled past ‚ÄúGo to my forms‚Äù. Then scrolled back up and saw it, clicked it, clicked ‚Äúcontinue form‚Äù. I‚Äôm back at the form, at step 3. I would just proceed forward with the information. My phone doest his predictive text things so that‚Äôs helpful. Participant manually types city and postal code in.** 

**Next page: participant manually types in home phone number and email.**

**On step 5 of 6. Okay, so, I have my statement. I would definitely use the mike here. (Participant speaks their statement into the field) (Screenshare stopped working) It says it has saved it so that‚Äôs good. (Screenshare restarted) So I‚Äôm just going to continue this process, right now it‚Äôs just a review of my application, my information, just to make sure it‚Äôs what I actually entered (participant looks through all information they entered). Statement of truth‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt ever do anything with VA.gov that‚Äôs not truthful so I don‚Äôt stress out about the statement of truth so the required portion wants my name (participant manually typed this in).** 

**So, my submission is in progress. I could print it for my records if I wanted to. It gives me the date that I started that submission. Okay so, because it says it‚Äôs ‚Äúin-progress‚Äù and it‚Äôs green‚Ä¶it says it can take up to 30 days for them to receive it but I‚Äôve got a confirmation number‚Ä¶I would save that‚Ä¶I would screenshot that. I would follow up in 30 days to make sure it was successfully submitted and received.**


### Watch for:

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user understand that they are continuing with the same form they started at the beginning of the session? Y/N

 - If no, what do they mention that is confusing?

- Is the user able to complete the started form? Y/N

 - If no, what prohibited them from submitting the initial form?


### Observation points for screen reader users:

- Does the participant navigate linearly or jump between sections?
  
- How do they orient themselves when they lose focus?
  
- Do they use heading navigation, landmarks, or other AT-specific features?
  

### Questions for screen magnifier users:

- Are you able to percieve the full form field labels and any error messages?
  
- Do you need to scroll horizontally to see all content?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience filling out the form from the mobile app using your [assistive tech/device]?
**It was what I expected it to be, it‚Äôs really simple. I do like that my phone remembers a lot of my information. Address, name, email, so all I really have to do is tap on it.**


- Were there any fields where your assistive technology didn't work as expected?
**Yeah, under the birthday I had a little issue. Not saying it wouldn‚Äôt work but first attempt it didn‚Äôt work so I just manually entered it.**

- What worked well for you?
**Well um, actually, maneuvering. I got lost, I wasn‚Äôt sure where I was, where I was needing to go but I got visual confirmation I was in the right place but there was bold type saying I was in the right place and I could start completing the application.**

- What was unclear for you?
**If you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing, of you click through those tabs you could probably find what you need to do but finding it, you could go to it straight away but sometimes it may take some looking for it to find it**

- How does this compare to filling out forms on VA.gov or other websites?
**Uh, it‚Äôs about the same. I mean, it‚Äôs similar. I think VA is, what you guys are doing, is trying to make it convenient, easy, really less confusing, less stressful, less complicated. If something can take 1 or 2 steps, let it take 1 or 2 steps, not 7 or 8. I think they‚Äôre really trying to achieve that.**

- What would make this process feel familiar to you?
**You had asked earlier int he conversation ‚Äúwhy do you go up there, what purpose?‚Äù This question, that‚Äôs why. So that you can go yhrough it without a maneuver. If you‚Äôre out of practice and you‚Äôre not used to how things have updated, where things have moved - to me, that‚Äôs stressful. I‚Äôd rather stay updated. I think the system knows how many times I‚Äôve logged on. So just staying familiar with it. And if you‚Äôre talking to another vet, sometimes you can help point them in the right direction. Or sometimes, if you‚Äôre talking to your VA clinicians, the information is right there with you. You can view your blood labs on your iPhone. You don‚Äôt have to call your PCP to find out what your blood labs were. You can see what they‚Äôre seeing. And you can get communications from them, maybe from the nurse. Or whatever. Maybe send them emaisl too.**


- If you had to take breaks, where would there be natural stopping points?
**I really like to just truck it on through and get it done but if I needed to take a break, it saves what you did last so you can stop wherever you needed to‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any particular place you have to stop. Maybe you have to stop‚Ä¶.wherever you are in the process, it‚Äôll save it.**

 
## Task 6: View submitted form
Now that you have completed the form, please go back to the app.


### Questions for testing participant: 
- Based on what you see now, how do you know the form was submitted? 

- What does this status mean to you?
**I got a message right here that says it was submitted on the 29th. It says it‚Äôs in-progress so, um, I really don‚Äôt know that it was submitted. It does say submitted but it also says in-progress so maybe I did what I needed to do so maybe the processing of the form I submitted might take 30 days to move from progress to yes, we see that we‚Äôve received your form‚Ä¶the in-progress part is a little confusing to me. That‚Äôs what I think that this means because I see this form was submitted. Because I‚Äôve done my part.**

- If you needed to reference this form submission in a phone call with VA, what information would you look for?
**To reference this claim: I would‚Äôve taken a screenshot of that confirmation id and the information that was on that little tab or I would‚Äôve jotted it down. Screenshot probably would‚Äôve been better for me. If I needed to speak to someone in IT, I can reference it. It has that date, it has that number.**

- What would you expect to see if you needed to check on your submission later?
**If needed to check on submission later: If I needed to checkout‚Äôs either gong to have this little in progress notice, it‚Äôll have a green button or some kind of message telling me I‚Äôve done what I needed to do and the receiver has done what they needed to do. Surely in 30 days it should be done.**
- How would you expect to be notified of updates to this form?
**Notified about updates:Because I kinda did a zoom through, it could‚Äôve said something about updates on it. I don‚Äôt remember seeing that. Um, there might be a way to track the updates‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶there might just be a way to look inside and maneuver and see updates on this form and any other one I‚Äôve submitted.**

### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user express confidence that they have completed and submitted their form?

 - If no, what is confusing to them and why?

- Does the user understand the status of the form?

 - If not, what do confusion do they express when interpretting the form status?


### Deleting the testing app:
Now that we have completed the study today I'm going to assist you with deleting the VA testing app from your device. 

**iOS users:** 
If you navigate to your device home screen, and engage the menu screen of the VA testing app we used today select 'Delete app'. Remove from device.

**Android users:***

1. We now need to ensure you turn off the developer options we turned on for the test from the "Google Play Store".
2. Navigate back to ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
3. Select ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù
4. Go back to the main phone home screen, lower menu bar select square in the middle.
5. Swipe up to remove Google Play Store window
6. Now go back to the main screen, open the ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
7. Click on your name in the top right 
8. Settings > General > Click on the ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù > Toggle off ‚ÄúInternal app sharing‚Äù
9. Go to settings on phone > scroll to bottom > click on developer options > Toggle on top for on/off > Toggle off (it will obscure the screen because of screen share)
10. Go back one, there should be no developer mode.

## Thank You and Closing - 3 minutes

- How was this process overall for you?
**I‚Äôve gotten used to these‚Ä¶it‚Äôs about what you guys are trying to do to connect veterans‚Ä¶some of us are out in the boonies and we need to be able to use our devices to join a zoom call or a Telehealth appt‚Ä¶.I like it, I think it was good.**

- Was there anything you would change about this process?
**No, no, um‚Ä¶I like the way you guys roll it out and I really appreciate your patience with us out here, even though it clearly says Eastern, some stuff will get by us.**

- What parts required the most concentration?
**You know, if I‚Äôm given a directive to, okay, go find where you would submit this form. That‚Äôs not hard to do but that was probably the hardest part of it. So I gotta go do something now, and I gotta do it.**


- Do you feel you would like to complete forms using the mobile app in the future? Why or why not?
**Yes, absolutely. It‚Äôs easy, um‚Ä¶using this digital means it‚Äôs just how things are these days. You don‚Äôt want to have to drive to a location 30 miles away and do it in person.  You can do it right there at your kitchen table. And it‚Äôs convenient. It‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs easy, it‚Äôs convenient.**


**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** 
- *(yes / no)* **Participant confirmed yes.**
- *(If participant says yes)* Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

**We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today**. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide. 

If you know any other Veterans or family members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
