# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **Christine**. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes **Notetaker First Name** and our accessibility specialist **AT Specialist First Name** will be on the call available to provide support with any technical issues that may arise with your use of assistive technology should you need it.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session as well. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If participant seems hesitant or unsure or uncomfortable)* Just so you know, my teammates will be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. You also have the option to keep the session just the two of us plus the notetaker (and the technical support person).
- *(If yes, let them in--3-4 MAX. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? 

Today we're going to talk about filling out forms from the VA mobile app. I'm going to ask you a few questions, and then I'll have you do some specific tasks using the VA Health & Benefits App. As you go through these steps please speak aloud your thoughts and actions to help us understand more about your experience.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This entire session may take 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing an app to learn how we can make it easier to use. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** Whether or not you choose to participate will not affect your benefits with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.

- Finally, I would like to record my screen and audio to confirm that I‚Äôve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don‚Äôt link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.
**Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - *(If yes:)* Once I start recording, I am going to confirm once more that you are ok with me recording this session.

‚û°Ô∏è Select **Record**, then **Record to the cloud**.

*(If participant asks you to NOT record)* Are you comfortable if I save the transcript of the session? *(If not, take good notes!)*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: 
  - **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?** **Yes** / No
 
  - **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners as long as we remove any information that can be used to identify you?** **Yes** / No

*Moderator: In the bottom toolbar of the Zoom window, click the arrow next to **SHOW CAPTIONS** > **View Full Transcript** > Save (NEED TO DO THIS TO GET TRANSCRIPT)*

*After checking that transcription is working, close the Transcript panel by clicking **Close Full Transcript** in the Show Captions menu.*


## Troubleshooting
- [Avoid **AI Companion**, which is a new option next to ‚ÄúShare‚Äù in the Zoom buttons]

- [If see **unpredictable jumping around** behavior and participant is using a browser other than Chrome, ask them to switch to Chrome (this helped with VoiceOver on an iPhone using Safari)]

- [If having **difficulty moving windows around** or opening the prototype, you could request control of the participant‚Äôs screen and mouse in Zoom: `<Name>‚Äôs screen tab > Request remote control`. Then you can move/resize browser (but not zoom windows/buttons) and type into browser bar. The participant may need to minimize the zoom video view, and drag the zoom buttons to the bottom of the screen so out of the way.]

# Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let‚Äôs start with a few questions...

1. I understand you are a Veteran. Is that right? "correct" 
    - Thanks for confirming that.

# User Tasks

## Task 0: Share screen

I would like you to share your screen with me so that I can see what you do during this session. Before we start, I want to make sure you know that screen share will show me your whole screen, so if you'd like to close any apps or turn off notifications that you don't want me to see, you could do that now.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*
- *STOP TECH TROUBLESHOOTING **< 15 min into session** if want a replacement participant from Perigean b/c not likely to be successful*

We can help guide you through sharing your screen when you're ready if you'd like assistance. Please say what you're doing out loud so that if there are any issues, we'll know what they are.
1. Make sure that the Zoom application has focus
2. Navigate to the screen share button (may need to tap on mobile device to display the menu at the bottom, may have to scroll over to see menu options).
3. Check the "share sound" checkbox (so we can hear their screen reader speaking)--may have to tab a LOT to get to this in the right pane
4. Activate the screen share

**(If video window is covering up phone screen)** It looks like my zoom video is covering up a lot of your screen. Could you please swipe it off? (Screen reader: swipe right until the video window has focus, and then double tap when you hear "Stash preview".)

## Task 00: Open prototype
**for iOS users:** 
Did you previously receive the link and instructions to download the testing version of the mobile app today? (User didn't respond to question, is trying to troubleshoot issue with Zoom and VoiceOver) (Jamie from ADE jumped into help troubleshoot) "Siri turn VoiceOver off." (Jamie shared power button menu shortcut for turning off VO) "Okay, now we got at least that part taken care of." (User appears to be navigating on iPad, screen is no longer sharing, Christine let user know, user reshared screen) "I just gotta adjust...Okay, had to adjust the speed, it jumped up from 55 to 200%" "I looked in the links and didn't see one. I think I might actuall have the app..." (Chrstine dropped link via chat) "I think that might be safer...there we go" (User appears to be navigating through menus, reading T&Cs, and agreeing to statements, prompted to install, asked to reinstall) "I think I installed it a couple of year ago..."  

Y - Were you able to download the app via those instructions? Y - skip down to note for all users " 

N - I can now share the URL: that takes you to download the testing app, How would you prefer to receive the URL? I could dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, email it to you, or (for smartphone only) text it to you.

**Note for all users: You'll be interacting with a demo prototype today.** Since it's a demo, note that none of your actions will affect your own VA information or benefits.


## Task 1: Login to the VA Health and Benefits mobile app
[start on the VA Health and Benefits mobile app version: 2.59.1 (3031) for iOS]

I'd like you to take a look at this screen, and sign in.

[When they get to the homepage:] Any data used throughout this test is not your real data or connected to your VA account in any way. This is a test environment with artifical testing data displayed only. 

**For screen magnifier participants.**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] "What is on your screen now?

Are you seeing the participants screen magnified at all? 

If not, ask the participant to check their settings on their device by navigating to...

1. Settings
2. Accessibility
3. Zoom
4. Show while mirroring toggle on



## Task 2: Start a statement
As we go through the steps in this study, please talk aloud about what you're thinking BEFORE clicking on anything.

Today I'd like you to pretend that you need to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself using the VA Health & Benefits Mobile App. 

### Question for testing participant:

- Before we start, what do you expect this process to be like? "there'll be a menu..gives me options to submit stuff..goes to someone who will recieve it, accept it, or you know, processing and all that..." 
  

Thank you for sharing that, You may begin the task to submit a statement in support of a new disability claim for yourself. (User is navigating through app, toggling up and down between sections, appears to be stuck in a loop on the claims history page) "Not sure how to get an active..." (Christine prompts, user navigates to claims DP) "...I don't see anything to submit a new one, it just goes to the active one." (User is looping through the claims history page again) "I can't figure out where to submit, create a new one...Claims, claims history, claims letters...Nope go eat (talking to puppy), nope go eat...yeah I don't know how to apply for a claim because there's already an extra one." 

*Allow the user to navigate to and through the form on their own without guiding them through the happy path. 

### If the user gets lost...

On a path that isn't fully built out and is stuck, you can **offer the 'Apple' button** at the top to jump them to the forms section of the app.


### Watch for:
- How the user gets to forms. Do they click anything other than "Go to Forms"? Y/N 

 - If Y, where do they go instead?

- Does the user mentions any confusion on where to go to start a new statement. Y/N

 - If Y, what do they find confusing?

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Did the user understand the 'Submit a statement in support of a claim' introductory screen? **Y**/N 

 - Did the user comment on this screen? "It says I don't have any active forms and then 'Start a statement'..." "Okay, I'm having a {something}...I was trying to get this...I don't know where I am...okay, what should I be doing now?" (adjusted accessibiility setting throughout, prompted to press continue to get to web form) "it's not letting me get any lower than I am now" (USWDS focus is pinned on profile, OS VO focus is jumping around the page) "I tried one finger, I tried two fingers...it's not going below what's on the screen" (Jamie tried to help here, user appears to be navigatring again and adjusting settings, turned off their facing-video for a second) "This thing is possessed...I was tyring to bring up the thing to turn off VoiceOver again but that wasn't working..." (Prompted to try again from the app, navigates to TestFlight, through GH page) "I did the three finger thing again but it didn't..." (User is scrolling through notifications section and various iOS native menus and features...user gets stuck on second bullet again, but is able to continue, navigates to next page) 

- What option did the user select on the 'What would you like to do here?' screen? "{inaudible}" "I have new evidence for an open claim..." (Clicks through to next page, clicks blue arrow "Upload...", interface gets stuck on loading screen) "Be glad you can't hear this...everytime it does that spin it just repeat the same thing" (User is stuck on loading screen) "I don't know this test...is this going to show up?" "Previous page" (Navigates back to radio button list, clicks same option as first time) "Download form link, or upload evidence...oh this is for an open claim, okay this is still for gathering evidence" "Okay it doesn't have to start a new claim, so I'll just click on this..." (Selects last option in radio button) 

  - Did the user share any confusion about the options provided?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the form from your [assistive tech/device]? "So far, stressful...I don't know why it's having all these issues...navigation is a little tougher...I don't know if you can start a cliam when yo have a claim submitted already..." 

- How confident do you feel that you're in the right place to submit your statement? "I am not at all confident...I think I'm in the 'help me', I can't find what I need and..." 

- Before you start the form itself, what do you expect this form completion process to be like? "Hopefuilly it'll be simple, straight forward...like in a typical form, I'm hoping it'll be simple to navigate." 


## Task 3: Fill out the form [never back out or reload the page]
As you go through this form I'll ask that you please fill it out using fake details so you don't share your personal information with me. 

**For screen magnifier participants:**
[Confirm you're seeing what they are seeing by asking them] First, I'd like to confirm "What is on your screen now? 

Thank you.

You may continue on with the form.

### Watch for:
- Does the user encounter any errors when entering the data into the form fields? **Y**/N

 - If Y, what field do they encounter errors on? Date of birth

 - What triggered the error specifically? Validation error on missing year info in Date of birth

 - If Y, what specific challenges did they experience?

 - How did the user troubleshoot these challenges?

- Does the user express thoughts of frustration while completing the form? Y/N

 - If Y, what did they experience when expressing the frustration?


## Task 4: (After SSN before 'Continue') take a break in filling out the form
At this point, I'm going to have you pretend that you need to step away from the form for an extended period of time, you can leave the form now and go back to the homepage of the mobile app. 


### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen? "I guess I would click the 'VA'..." (User trying to figure out how to get 'home', user saved application) "Alright do you want me to go to the home..." (User opens expos√©, clicks back into VA app) "I don't find any links saying to go to home...usually you'd click on VA and it would send you to the homepage, I don't see any links saying 'Home'..." (User continue to try navigating) "I click done maybe, or is that going to take me out of the whole thing?" "Finally...I'm at the VA home" 

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- What does the user do to leave the form?

- Does the user express doubt that their work will be saved? Y/N


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience navigating to the homepage of the app from the partially completed form [screen reader/assistive tech/device]? "Nightmare...not nightmare, but very difficult, there was no home button, because it's test flight I don't know what that meant so I was hestiant on clicking that...it seemed harder than it should've been" 

- How confident do you feel that your work will be saved? "That part I feel confident" 



## Task 5: Continue completing the started form and submit
Now, pretend you are ready to come back to your previous form. 

Please locate your previous form and continue on. "Alright it says I don't have any active forms" (It looks like the prototype broke, missing in progress forms UI) "Alright so I guess I didn't save it or I don't know how to get back to it...it says 'you don't have any active forms'..." "I would take a deep breath and click start a statement and try again, if it's not in here I have to start again...maybe it'll pop up." "So do I go back to that same thing, 'It's not listed here'?" "Alright" (user fills out form again) "Alright this is a far as we got before..." (User triggers SSN error) "It's not accepting that social security number" (Jamie steps in to help resolve error "123456789" doesn't work) "Good to know" (User continues form) "Okay now it's saying I'm not connected to the internet...then I didn't see your camera on..." "It keeps saying it's not able to connecct to the VA" (Jamie launched error by accident, Matt is restarting the codespace, all information is lost, Christine asks if user wants to continue, user navigates to GH portal) "I mean it's at least it's the blue that easy to find...It's like deja vu" (User fill out form again, hits same validation error with date field and year, continues through each section without any issues, no errors, get to statement page) "Okay" (User writes statement, continues, doesn't open expandable section for before signing and submitting form, successfully submits). 


### Watch for:

- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user understand that they are continuing with the same form they started at the beginning of the session? Y/**N** (They're not in the same form from earlier.) 

 - If no, what do they mention that is confusing?

- Is the user able to complete the started form? Y/**N**

 - If no, what prohibited them from submitting the initial form? Missing UI 


### Observation points for screen reader users:

- Does the participant navigate linearly or jump between sections? Linear  
  
- How do they orient themselves when they lose focus? Loop through pages 
  
- Do they use heading navigation, landmarks, or other AT-specific features?
  

### Questions for screen magnifier users:

- Are you able to percieve the full form field labels and any error messages?
  
- Do you need to scroll horizontally to see all content?


### Questions for testing participant: 

- How was your experience filling out the form from the mobile app using your [assistive tech/device]? "The last time was so much better, the first three times it was difficult...when you're on website and programs and the technology does't work the way it should...then all the sudden it worked...the last time it went decent, I kind of wish we had the option to just speak...so I could've just spoke it and not typed it, it's quicker" 

- Were there any fields where your assistive technology didn't work as expected? "Page would move a little, so I'd click it once and then twice and the page moved a little...the positions of your finger sometimes you're off a little...otherwise it seemed to work well when it worked...there was no 'submit a new form'...you can't put in more than one claim at a time so...{it would've been nice to have options}." 

- What worked well for you? "breathing techniques, staying calm...everything that could go wrong seems to go wrong...if I have to use two fingers for a command but it somehow turn my fingers a little then it opens up the rotary...it can be a little bit stressful at times...you get used to it...all you can do it remain calm" (Mentioned tech issue with codespace, "no internet") "There was no 'home' at the bottom...There was no quick escape...there are no options like that..." "It seems to be working well"  

- What was unclear for you? "Like how to do the forms and stuff...when I click a box everytime I do that it read the entire, but you still have to click on the words underneath...and when you're not sure what you need to do...I was hitting blue stuff and I was like..."Somethings going to happen, it's somekind of link...so it's a link, I was thinking these are things that might be able to help me...but there's also help at the bottom at all times and there's like no chatbot or anything...even if they had a chatbot that would be nice...you ask 'trying to submit a new form...' that would be good" 

- How does this compare to filling out forms on VA.gov or other websites? "I don't have a keyboard connected to my iPad so I have to finger type every letter" "On my computer I can speak it or type it and that's easier" "That does help sometimes speech-to-text..." (user noted issues with confiential info and speech to text, like a timer, that might cause issues) 

- What would make this process feel familiar to you? "The type of form layout, like the way it was...like on a keyboard I can use the tab and switch straight through, too bad there wasn't a way to do that...To make it more familiar, I'm not sure. I don't typically do forms on the iPad, I have a 75" monitor so I don't need VoiceOver...which is awesome...I can sit 5 feet away and feel like the typical person" 

- If you had to take breaks, where would there be natural stopping points? "They should have that option on the bottom at all times, like 'save and pause'...a lot of the time when you do that online those are options...after you put in all your personal information...at the end of that is a good place to pause, important stuff in there, save it...that would be a good spot, I would have that option on each page..."  

 
## Task 6: View submitted form
Now that you have completed the form, please go back to the app.


### Questions for testing participant: 
- Based on what you see now, how do you know the form was submitted? "It says...Today's date...In progress..." 

- What does this status mean to you? "It means it was submitted and it'll end up getting a line and...sent to where it's supposed to go and wait for somebody to open it and check it...typically it'll show you the process...tell you this process and as you're going through...it can be up to six months for them to process the claim" "It's nice that on the app it shows you your progress, where you're at" 

- If you needed to reference this form submission in a phone call with VA, what information would you look for? "Um...Form number is great, when it was submitted...you can't click it, it doesn't give you a case number but that you're SSN typically...that's the only think you can do, give them your SSN and form number and..." 

- What would you expect to see if you needed to check on your submission later? "See claim number and option to submit more evidence...if I could click on this maybe it would give me the option to update or add more information...so it you remember something you can attach it to this claim..."

- How would you expect to be notified of updates to this form? "Email." "I believe there is an option for a telephone call...I always recieve email...oh no, I never recieve‚ÄîI just have to go into the app and check...it never did give notifications, it would be great if it did..." 

### Watch for:
- In this step, what did the participant expect to happen?

 - Did they mention any previous experience or confusion?

- Does the user express confidence that they have completed and submitted their form?

 - If no, what is confusing to them and why?

- Does the user understand the status of the form?

 - If not, what do confusion do they express when interpretting the form status?


### Deleting the testing app:
Now that we have completed the study today I'm going to assist you with deleting the VA testing app from your device. 

**iOS users:** 
If you navigate to your device home screen, and engage the menu screen of the VA testing app we used today select 'Delete app'. Remove from device.

**Android users:***

1. We now need to ensure you turn off the developer options we turned on for the test from the "Google Play Store".
2. Navigate back to ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
3. Select ‚Äúuninstall‚Äù
4. Go back to the main phone home screen, lower menu bar select square in the middle.
5. Swipe up to remove Google Play Store window
6. Now go back to the main screen, open the ‚ÄúGoogle Play Store‚Äù
7. Click on your name in the top right 
8. Settings > General > Click on the ‚ÄúDeveloper options‚Äù > Toggle off ‚ÄúInternal app sharing‚Äù
9. Go to settings on phone > scroll to bottom > click on developer options > Toggle on top for on/off > Toggle off (it will obscure the screen because of screen share)
10. Go back one, there should be no developer mode.
11. Reinstall the VA app

(hint: to switch browser windows the user can select the three lines III in the bottom left corner of their lower nav. menu)

## Thank You and Closing - 3 minutes

- How was this process overall for you? "Adventerous...we had basically a lot of technical issues...the process seemed...like a typical process, just basics...simple enough." 

- Was there anything you would change about this process? "The home access, make that more accessible or an AI or chatbot like thing...sometime you only need like a 'how do I do this...'..." 

- What parts required the most concentration? "Listening to the forms, there's a lot of information...The titles, the headings, you just go from heading to heading..." 

- Do you feel you would like to complete forms using the mobile app in the future? Why or why not? "I've done it with the BVA, they have someone who can do it with me...they know how to word everything, how to put it down...simplier to get assistace, especially with a claim...you don't always know exactly what you need." "Some things it's better to let a professional do than yourself" 


**Are you still okay if we use any video or audio clips from this session?** 
- *(**yes** / no)*
- *(If participant says yes)* Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want shared in a video clip? (Skipped question) 

**We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today**. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide. 

If you know any other Veterans or family members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
