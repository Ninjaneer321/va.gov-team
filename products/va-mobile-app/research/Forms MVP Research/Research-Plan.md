	# Research Plan for [VA Flagship Mobile Team, VAHB Mobile App, June, 2025]

## Background 🏗️
Briefly describe the background of your product.
	
The VA Mobile App team recently resolved SSO issues that had previously prevented Veterans from accessing VA.gov within a web view while maintaining their authenticated state. 

This technical improvement creates a new opportunity to integrate the Forms feature into the mobile app, functionality that is not currently available in the mobile experience. 

As part of the MVP, the app introduces the form 4138, a widely used form, in the mobile app so Veterans can: 
1. Complete VA forms in a secure web view from a mobile device; and
2. Check status of these forms in the mobile app


### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

This research supports the following OCTO priorities: 

- VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

- OCTO positively influences VA's ability to deliver software products and services faster, safer, and with higher quality.

> **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.


### [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

The research covers broad spectrum of VA services, and applies at the following stages.
- Starting Up
- Taking Care of Myself
- Reinventing Myself
- Putting Down Roots
- Retiring
- Aging


## Research Goals 🥅	
The key objective of this study is to evaluate the usability of completing a VA form in a webview from the VA Health and Benefits app. 
Additionally, the research aims to uncover the following:
1. Understand if Veterans can find and interact with forms from the app.
2. Identify if Veterans can fill out a form from the app on their own.
3. Identify any usability issues Veterans may experience when interacting with forms on the mobile app.

  
### Outcome
The results of the study will help us determine if Veterans are able to interact with forms from the mobile app and to identify any pain points. This will inform future form development on the app.


### Research questions

1. Are Veterans able to locate forms within the VA app?

2. Are Veterans able to fill out a form from the app on their own?

3. Are Veterans able to continue started forms from within the app?

4. How do Veterans expect once the form is submitted?


### Hypotheses

1. Most Veterans will be able to find forms from within the app easily.
2. Most Veterans will be able to complete a form on the app through a web-view without major usability issues.
3. Most Veterans will be able to access and continue a started form through the mobile app.
4. Veterans will expect to see immediate confirmation upon a form submission.

## Methodology  🛠️

This study will use remote moderated usability testing to evaluate different form-related flows. Participants will complete tasks while sharing their screen via Zoom on their mobile device.
During the usability testing following flows will be observed:
- Submitting a new Form 4138 through the in-app webview
- Continuing an in-progress form from the mobile app

Task success will be measured using the Single Ease Question (SEQ), a task-level metric that captures how easy or difficult participants perceived each task to be. 
This allows the researcher to explore additional feedback during the testing session.

## Research materials 📔

> [!NOTE]
> **Your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.**

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment 🎯	

### Recruitment approach
We would like Pergean's support in recruiting eligibile participants for the study. 

### Recruitment criteria
- Must have interacted with the mobile app at lease once
- Must be non-AT participants
- 3 to 4 Veterans from rural areas
- 3 to 4 Veterans over the age of 55

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:

- `Veterans:` **[8]**
- `Caregivers:` **[0]**
- `Dependents:` **[0]**
- `Total:` **[8]**

### Screening Question
We are interested in talking to Veterans that use the app in various frequencies.

1. How often do you use the VA Health and Benefits app?
- Daily
- A few times a week
- A few times a month
- Less than once a month
- I'm not sure
- I don't use the app

If option 'f' was selected, the following optional question should be included: 
"Thanks for letting us know. Can you share bit about why you don't use the VA Health and Benefits app?"

## Timeline 🗓️
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[Enter dates and times MM/DD HH:MM]**

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: **60 minutes**
- `Maximum Sessions per day: **4 sessions**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
>
> **Place time slots between `hash marks` when in edit mode.**

- `[MM/DD, Day, TT:TT AM/PM-TT:TT AM/PM] EST`
