# Forms MVP Usability Study Notes
Testing flow: Submitting a statement in support of a claim, from the VA Health & Benefits app.
Session dates: 8/12-8/15

## P1: 

### Per designer:

Forms UXR Session 081225 0700 PT

iOS / Internet Explorer (said this verbatim, maybe they weren’t sure about their actual default browser—could be it’s Safari?).

Hesitated when asked about filling out forms on VA, wasn’t sure about time he had done this before.

Prototype isn’t correct, wasn’t built to spec (mismatch w/ Figma)

We won’t know if the new navigation button we wanted to test is usable or desirable from this study.

WebView date in form—Error state launches before user has attempted to fill in all fields, this is incorrect—shouldn’t lead to a fail state before we we’ve allowed users to try to succeed.

Couldn’t find “Done” link to dismiss the WebView, needed prompting from moderator to continue.

Should we make confirmation numbers and status both available in the app? So users don’t have to go to WebView when troubleshooting or providing the number to someone else?

“It’s in the mail, going to a place” = Vet’s “In progress” mental model.

Mimic’d “easy” question back to us as feedback, did we slip in a leading question in by accident?

I thought it was interesting that dismissing the WebView was a struggle, I wouldn't have guess that.

### Per engineer:

Finding the “Done” or “Close” button wad difficult - I feel as though this is going to be a trend.

IE response was interesting, they could have meant Micosoft Edge and not IE - you can use Edge on the phone.

Most pauses were just figuring out how to close the webview (closing it to fill out later and closing it cause you have submitted the form).
