## Learnings from Q4 2025

---

## At-a-Glance

**VA Mobile App Analysis | Q4 2025**

### Veteran satisfaction remains consistently high, with over 75% positive ratings.

Users continue to describe the app as easy to use, convenient, and reliable. Positive reviews frequently highlight the app's ability to centralize VA health and benefits tools in one place — making it a major improvement over earlier VA digital experiences. Prescriptions remain the highest-rated feature with consistent praise for ease of refills.

### Login and authentication continue to be the most reported pain point.

Across all three months of Q4, login issues remained the most frequently cited frustration. Veterans report biometric failures, credential lockouts, sign-in loops, and challenges with ID.me and Login.gov. In November, login received an average feature rating of 2.86 — the lowest of any feature tracked. This aligns with findings from Q1–Q3.

### Missing appointment details and document accessibility emerge as growing concerns.

While appointment access is a valued feature, Veterans increasingly report frustration with incomplete appointment information — missing provider names, department details, and room numbers. Additionally, Veterans in October and December reported being unable to access claims letters or payment histories for certain years, signaling potential backend data-loading issues.

## Data Snapshot

**VA Mobile App Analysis | Q4 2025**

### Ratings Distribution (October–November 2025)

_Note: December 2025 data did not include a ratings distribution breakdown. The figures below represent October and November combined (803 total responses)._

| Rating | # of Ratings | % of Ratings |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | 516 | 64.3% |
| 4 | 88 | 11.0% |
| 3 | 64 | 8.0% |
| 2 | 49 | 6.1% |
| 1 | 86 | 10.7% |

**Positive (4–5 stars):** 604 ratings (75.2%)
**Neutral (3 stars):** 64 ratings (8.0%)
**Negative (1–2 stars):** 135 ratings (16.8%)

### Key Results

Veteran satisfaction scores remain consistent with Q3 (75.5% positive) and continue the positive trend observed throughout FY25. The ratio of negative ratings (~17%) also remains stable, indicating that while the app broadly works well for the majority, a persistent subset of users encounter blocking issues — most commonly related to sign-in.

## Positive Sentiments

**VA Mobile App Analysis | Q4 2025**

### Over 75% of Reviews Praised the Mobile App for Ease of Use, Simplicity, and Convenience

Veterans who gave the app a positive rating (4 or 5 stars) consistently praise the app as valuable because of its simplicity and ease of use. Many Veterans note that the app centralizes critical VA tools — prescriptions, messaging, appointments, claims, and letters — in one place that is easier to use than the website.

The reviews from October through December 2025 show that the following elements of the app are highly valued by Veterans:

- **Prescriptions:** Continues to be the highest-rated feature. Veterans praise how easy it is to view and refill medications from their phones. November data showed prescriptions with a 4.55 average rating.
- **Navigation:** Most navigation-related comments remain positive, with Veterans noting intuitive design and easy access to information from the home screen.
- **Messaging:** Secure messaging is widely used and appreciated. Veterans value the efficiency of communicating with their care team without calling or visiting in person.
- **Consolidated Access:** Many Veterans appreciate having appointments, claims, prescriptions, and benefits information all accessible from a single app.

> "The app is wonderful. Easy to use and easy to navigate." — Veteran

> "Simply easy to use." — Veteran

> "Has the most needed things without the extra stuff. One-stop app for refills, messages, and appointment information. I like it." — Veteran

> "Whoever developed and maintains this app deserves to be paid more." — Veteran

## Negative Sentiments

**VA Mobile App Analysis | Q4 2025**

### Approximately 17% of Reviews Reported Frustrations — Primarily Linked to Login, Missing Information, and App Errors

Veterans who rated the app 3-stars or less shared several recurring challenges during Q4. These challenges are consistent with those identified in Q1–Q3:

- **Sign-in Issues (~50+ mentions across Q4):** Veterans continue to struggle with login — biometric failures, credential lockouts, sign-in loops, and confusion around ID.me/Login.gov. Login received the lowest feature rating in November (2.86 avg) and remained a dominant theme in December reviews.
- **Missing or Incomplete Appointment Details (~25+ mentions):** Veterans report that appointment entries lack provider name, department, room number, and reason for visit. This was flagged across all three months and is one of the most consistent themes across Q4.
- **Letters and Documents Inaccessible (~15+ mentions):** Veterans could not find claims decision letters, or found that payment history only loaded for certain years. December reviews also noted incorrect dates on printed disability letters.
- **Messaging Difficulties (~10+ mentions):** Some Veterans could not find their providers in the messaging recipient list or struggled to locate the messaging feature within the app. Others requested the ability to delete old messages.
- **App Errors and Glitches:** A small but impactful subset of users reported the app "no longer working" after updates, including crashes and extended loading times.

> "Way too difficult signing in." — Veteran

> "The appointment details should include the department and name of the doctor… Just having a date and time is very vague and unacceptable." — Veteran

> "I can't find my Claim decision letter." — Veteran

> "No longer works properly, keeps giving errors. Useless." — Veteran

**VA Mobile App Analysis | Q4 2025**

### Priorities Carried Forward from Q3 Roadmap

Per the Q3 research roadmap, the following were planned for Q1 FY26 (January–March 2026):
