# Defining the Most Important Metrics for the VAHB Mobile App

## What story are we trying to tell through the data?
The data can tell 2 stories: A story about the user’s experience **(experiential metrics)** and a story about the platform’s health **(platform metrics)**.

# Experiential metrics

**Experiential metrics** capture the quality of the user’s experience — how well the product helps people achieve their goals, how easy it is to use. They can provide insight into how users experience the app, including navigation patterns, common tasks, and points of friction. Experiential metrics can be measured through **user tasks** and **non-tasks**.

### User Tasks
**User Tasks** are goal-oriented actions that a user initiates with intent to complete a specific objective. Examples:
* Logging in 
* Sending a secure message
* Updating contact information
* Requesting a prescription refill

**Characteristics:**
* Requires user effort and decision-making
* Has a clear beginning and end
* Can typically be labeled as “completed” or “not completed”

We have organized user tasks by user flow. 14 key flows have been identified in the attached [spreadsheet](URL).

### Non-tasks
**Non-tasks** are passive, informational, or exploratory interactions not necessarily tied to a concrete goal. Examples:
* Viewing a push notification
* Browsing the home screen
* Viewing disability rating
* Viewing claim status 

**Characteristics:**
* May not have a defined end state
* Doesn’t always result in a transaction or submission
* Often serves to inform, guide, or prompt future actions

| Type | What to measure | Metrics | Notes | 
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **User Tasks** | Task success and efficiency | - Task completion rate<br>- Time on task<br>- Error rate<br>- Drop-off rate<br>- Retry attempts | Collect in-app analytics on key flows (e.g. Rx refill, viewing appointments) 14 key flows have been identified in the attached spreadsheet|
| **Non-tasks** | User engagement and awareness | - Views<br> - Click-through rate (CTR)<br>- Dwell time <br>- Notification open rate | Focus on passive or content-related interactions. Can serve as leading indicators of task initiation. |

|      | Accessing the App and Logging In |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **User goal**      | *"I need convenient access to view and manage my VA health benefits on-the-go."* |
| **What should we measure?** | Successful login, the first time<br> *"I was easily able to login the first time."* |
| **Helpful metrics**| - Login success rate<br> - Time to login<br> - Recovery rate<br>- Most common logout reasons (e.g. due to connectivity issues, app updates)<br>- Most common login failure reasons<br>- Active users<br>- New users<br>- Logins started event count<br>- Logins completed event count<br>- Login completed webview steps event count<br>- Logins canceled login event count<br>- Authenticated users<br>- Higher frequency reporting intervals than monthly (e.g. real-time data for login success or time to login)<br>- Qualitative trends in login issues from Feedback Hub channels<br>- Future: Login survey |
| **Unhelpful metrics** | - Measuring login success on a monthly basis. Consider higher frequency reporting intervals than monthly (e.g. weekly for login success or time to login) |

# Platform metrics

**Platform metrics** center around the performance, stability, and operational health of the underlying platform or system that delivers the experience. They are **system-centered** and measured from the technical perspective. 
- Reflect uptime, speed, scalability, and reliability
- Usually quantitative and diagnostic

## How should we define "the overall health" of the Mobile Platform? 
Overall platform health can be measured by the following factors:
- Speed
- Availability
- Reliability
- Consistency
- User satisfaction 
- Adoption
- Retention

The following tables define each measurement factor and provides helpful metrics to track, related user experiences, and how it can inform decision-making.
