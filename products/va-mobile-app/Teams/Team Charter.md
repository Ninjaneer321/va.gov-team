## How we work

### Communications

#### Slack DSVA “#va-mobile-app”:

This is the main means of communication with the VA Mobile App Core Team. We aim to keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

Additional public channels include:
#va-mobile-app-design
#va-mobile-app-engineering

#### GitHub

- Product and research documentation are on[ VA.gov repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app).
- Codebase and issues are on separate [VA mobile repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app).
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, link the slack thread or copy information into GitHub ticket. 

See [Team Norms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/Teams/Team%20Norms.md) for more details on team communications.

#### Estimation

We use fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to account for the level of effort, complexity, and amount of unknowns in our work. Here is our guide:

##

| Points | Complexity | Meaning                                                                                      |
| ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | xxsmall    | Trival change - Up to 2 hours (time mostly in submitting the work)                           |
| 2      | xsmall     | Small change - Up to 4 hours (More validation is required)                                   |
| 3      | small      | Routine addon/none new - 1 to 2 days (small work/high domain knowledge/1 or no moving parts) |
| 5      | medium     | Routine addon/none new - 2 to 3 days (medium work/1-2 moving parts)                          |
| 8      | large      | New work/High Complexity - 3 to 5 days (over 2 moving parts)                                 |
| 13     | xlarge     | Too big/Risky, should be broken down - 1 to 2 weeks                                          |
