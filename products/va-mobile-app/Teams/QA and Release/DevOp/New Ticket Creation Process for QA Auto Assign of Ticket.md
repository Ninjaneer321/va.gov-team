## New Process for Ticket Creation: Ensuring Auto-Assignment to QA

To streamline the workflow and ensure that tickets are automatically assigned to QA after they are marked as testable or ready for QA, it is essential to follow the new process for ticket creation. This guide outlines the steps required to ensure the correct labels are applied to tickets.

## Purpose
The auto-assignment to QA relies on specific labels being present on the ticket. To facilitate this process and avoid manual intervention, both the team label and the "FE-With QA" label must be present on the ticket.

## Steps for Ticket Creation
- Create a New Ticket

When creating a new ticket, fill in the necessary details such as title, description, and any other required fields.
- Add the Team Label

- Select the appropriate team label that corresponds to the team responsible for the ticket. This could be any predefined label that identifies the team (e.g., "Health", "Global", "design-system").
- Add the "FE-With QA" Label

In addition to the team label, ensure to add the "FE-With QA" label to the ticket. This label signifies that the ticket will undergo QA once it is marked as testable or ready for QA.
- Save the Ticket

After adding both labels, save the ticket. The system will now recognize that both conditions are met for the auto-assignment to QA to occur.
## Example
Creating a Ticket for the Global Team
- Title: Implement New Login Feature
- Description: Detailed description of the new login feature.
- Labels:
   Team Label:global
   QA Label: FE-With QA
- Save the Ticket
By ensuring that both the "global" and "FE-With QA" labels are present on the ticket, the system will automatically assign it to QA once it is marked as testable or ready for QA.

## Importance of Correct Labeling
Correct labeling is crucial for the following reasons:

- Automates Workflow: Ensures that the ticket is automatically assigned to QA without manual intervention, saving time and reducing errors.
- Maintains Consistency: Provides a consistent process for all teams, making it easier to manage and track tickets.
- Improves Efficiency: Streamlines the process, allowing QA to receive tickets promptly and begin testing without delays.
  
## Summary
To ensure the auto-assignment to QA works as intended, always add both the team label and the "FE-With QA" label to the ticket. This simple yet critical step will help maintain an efficient and automated workflow, ensuring that tickets move smoothly through the development and QA process.
