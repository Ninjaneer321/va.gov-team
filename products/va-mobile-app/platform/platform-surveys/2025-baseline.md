## Platform Survey - 2025 Baseline

### Methodology
- survey was designed to help us understand how well we're meeting the needs of teams building features on the VAHB app and to establish baseline metrics
- survey was anonymous and open to
  - VA and contract team members
  - all practices (design/research, engineering, and product)
  - all teams, including Core Mobile, MFS, Feature teams building on the app, and Feature teams collaborating with Core Mobile or MFS to build features
- participants were recruited through Slack messages in general mobile and feature team specific channels, and in direct messages to the VA Product Owners and contract Product Managers of the various teams
