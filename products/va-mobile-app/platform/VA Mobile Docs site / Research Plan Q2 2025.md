## Background

The VA Mobile Docs site is the main source of written guidance and documentation for how to interact with the Mobile Platform and build features for the Mobile App. The current VA Mobile Docs site was initially created as operational documentation for the platform mobile team and evolved to also assist teams across the VA in developing for mobile in collaboration with the VA mobile team. Its last update occurred about 3 years ago and currently does not include up to date guidance for the Mobile Platform. Additionally, there is guidance to move any related design system elements of the site over to the VA design system itself. 

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

Objective: OCTO teammates are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact.

> - **Key Result 1:** Team members reporting more than a reasonable amount of stress is 5 points lower for each quarter in 2025 than it was in the corresponding quarter in 2024.
> - **Key Result 2:** Every OCTO Portfolio identifies 2 or more strategic decisions per quarter that would benefit the larger OCTO team, and documents them publicly in a shared location.
> - **Key Result 3:** 75% or more team members are confident they have the knowledge needed to make effective decisions.

Objective: OCTO positively influences VA's ability to deliver software products and services faster, safer, and with higher quality.

> - **Key Result 1:** OCTO has delivered at least 10 impactful artifacts or learning activities (e.g., trainings, guides, COP meetings) focused on improving delivery practices that achieve an NPS score of 30 or higher from the target OIT delivery staff.
> - **Key Result 2:** OCTO has helped resolve/support at least 10 significant engineering issues or products outside our portfolio.
> - **Key Result 3:** Five or more non-OCTO teams have used SPRUCE to deliver high quality software.

## Research Goals 🥅	

### Goals

1. **[Identify how the VA Mobile Docs site can be improved to better serve all teams.]**

2. **[Determine when we can link experience teams to VADS and when we should give guidance.]**

3. **[EXP teams are able to access the docs site and find answers to their questions.]** 
  
### Outcome
After this research the mobile platform team will have evidence-based direction for improvements to the VA Mobile Docs with clear ways to measure success based on the following success criteria.

1. EXP Team satisfaction in relation to Docs Site is positive.
2. EXP Teams show an increase in use of Docs Site.


### Research questions

1. **[Who is using the VA Mobile docs site today?]**

2. **[How frequently are they interacting with the site?]**

3. **[Do they need to go elsewhere to find information to build for mobile?]**

4. **[What questions do they have after visiting the VA mobile docs site?]**

5. **[How does the content on the VA Mobile docs site serve the needs of the different users (engineering, UX design/researchers, business, etc.)?]**

6. **[How satisfied are experience team members with the current VA mobile docs site?]**


### Hypotheses

We understand that the current VA Mobile Docs site is outdated and not fully aligned with the evolving needs of various experience teams. We anticipate our research to help us identify user satisfaction with the site in its current state, as well as provide insight into what experience team users need from the site to guide the redesign. Our hypothesis assumes that by updating and tailoring the documentation on the site to include current best practices and user-specific guidance while also improving overall site navigation that user satisfaction and the frequency of site usage will increase.

  
## Methodology  🛠️
	
User Interviews: to gather qualitative insights on user experiences, pain points, and opportunities to improve the VA Mobile Docs site.
