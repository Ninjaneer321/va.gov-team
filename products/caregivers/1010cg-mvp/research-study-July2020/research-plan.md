# Research Plan for [Caregiver, 10-10CG, June 22, 2022]

## Goals

This study is being conducted by the VSA Caregiver team.
The VA’s Caregiver program enables caregivers and Veterans to receive benefit payments from VA. To date, the Caregiver program has focused on post-911 Veterans. The Mission Act calls for the expansion of this program to all eras of Veterans and an IT system to be built in order to support the expansion of the program.
The internal system (CARMA) requires the manual input of paper applications (form 1010-CG). When the Caregiver program expands, the paper process will not scale.
The Caregiver team has developed an MVP to move the 1010-CG online. The form has been coded (in staging), and we plan on testing the form with users before the form goes live on VA.gov. 

**The goals of this usability study are to:**

- Document and prioritize any outstanding usability issues that might come up when caregivers and Veterans fill out the online 1010-CG

- Help the program team understand veteran and caregiver priorities when it comes to potential new features

- Determine whether the caregiver or Veteran have a clear and realistic understanding of requirements and expectations once form is submitted (next steps). 

- Provide the Caregiver program team with recommendations for moving forward. 

**The research questions we want to address are:**

- What is the desirability of new features? 

- Are users able to navigate through the form easily and without hiccups?

- Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (content/components)? 

- Do users understand how to fill in each field?

- Do applicants understand requirements and are next steps transparent? 

- What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form?

**Our hypothesis**

Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:

- Clearly understanding when they’re entering veteran information versus caregiver information

- Understanding what a secondary caregiver is, and if they should add one 

- Understanding what happens (nexts steps) after submission

## Method	

**Directed interviews**

**A task-based usability study** will be conducted remotely with Zoom. A remote moderator will begin with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototype. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.  

We will be testing with a coded form in staging. 

  
## Participants and Recruitment	

We would like to work with Perigeon to recruit remote users.  We are looking for:

7 Caregivers
- if possible, some who have heard of these benefits and are either already enrolled or in the process of applying or considering applying
- If possible, include 1-2 secondary caregivers

7 Veterans **who have caregivers** 
- mix of pre-911 and post-911 Veterans
- Include a mix of Veterans with a disability rating of 80% or higher
- Include a mix of Veterans who live and do not live with caregivers

## When

- We would like to run a pilot session with Perigeon and one of our team members  
 This should include Jonathan and Shawna and the observers as well (emails below)
- Sessions will take place starting July 

- Sessions should last ~45 minutes

- Specific time slots:

   - For January 16th, please schedule sessions between noon - 5pm Eastern time 

   - For the rest of the days, please schedule sessions between 9am - 5pm Eastern time

- Moderator: Jonathan Nelson (jonathan.nelson@adhocteam.us) 

- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator): Jonathan Nelson (jonathan.nelson@adhocteam.us) and Shawna Hein (shawna@adhocteam.us, 530 277 4925)

- Participant recruiting & screening: Perigeon

- Project point of contact: Jonathan Nelson (jonathan.nelson@adhocteam.us) and Shawna Hein (shawna@adhocteam.us, 530 277 4925)
