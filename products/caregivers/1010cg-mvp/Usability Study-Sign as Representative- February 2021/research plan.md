# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, February 2020

## Background

This study is being conducted by the VSA Caregiver team.	

The Caregiver team launched the digitized 10-10CG form October 1, 2020. Currently, the team is adding functionality that allows a Veteran’s legal representative to be identified and documentation (e.g. power of attorney) to be optionally uploaded. Designs have also been updated to surface information around Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregivers.
 
Designs have been created to support the additional functionality of identifying a legal representative. The team hopes to test the understandability, usability, and ease of use of the two representative workflow options and if the suggested changes improve the understanding of Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregivers.

## Goals

The goals of this user research study are to determine: 

- The usability differences between two representative workflow options.
- If the cognitive understanding of Primary Family Caregiver versus Secondary Family Caregivers improved.

### Research questions

The research questions we want to address are: 

- Does one of the representative workflow options perform better than the other with regards to understandability, usability, and use of use?
- Are users confused by any particular aspect of the representative workflow?
- Does the current representative workflow stop users from completing the form?
- Do the changes to the Primary Family Caregiver versus Secondary Family Caregivers display improve or hinder understanding?
- Would a user upload a document from their mobile phone or only from a desktop computer?


Our hypothesis: 

- Testing the two representative workflows will result in a clear choice between the options due to better understandability, usability and user preference.

- Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
  - the terminology/content might be confusing within the representative workflow
  - the representative workflow might stop users (especially caregivers who are not legal representatives) from completing the form
  - Knowing if a Veteran or caregiver should select the Primary Family Caregiver or Secondary Family Caregiver workflow 

## Methodology 

A task-based comparison/usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow the team to share high-fidelity wireframe prototypes (desktop and mobile) to answer our research questions and confirm/deny our hypothesis.


## Participants and Recruitment

We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 13 fulfilled sessions.  

We are looking for 13 participants, a mix of Veterans and caregivers.

**Must have for participants**

All participants must be yes to one of the following questions:

- Are you a caregiver to a Veteran?  (must recruit at least 6)

or

- Are you a Veteran who has a caregiver? (must recruit at least 2)

Answer must be yes for 5 participants: 

- Are you a Veteran’s legal representative? 
  - If confused, provide this explanation: A representative is a person who, under applicable law, has authority to act on behalf of the Veteran or who is legally vested with the responsibility or care of the Veteran. 

**Good to have for participants**

- At least 2 participants with a disability rating with a disability rating of 70% or greater and identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. 
- 50% women, 50% men.
- 50% people who identify as an ethnicity/race other Caucasian.
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55.
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area


**Recruitment requirements**
 
- Half (6) must have a mobile device and be willing to be complete the test on said device
- Half of the mobile test participants (3) taking the test on an iOS mobile device
- Half of the mobile test participants (3) taking the test on an Android mobile device
- Half (6) must have a laptop/desktop and be willing to be complete the test on said laptop/desktop
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom.


## Timeline 

**Desired Timeline: Feb. 16 - 19, 2021**

Session length: 1 hour 

**Please do not schedule back to back sessions**
