# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Digitization of the 10-10CG Form, January 2020
 	
## Goals	
This study is being conducted by the VSA Caregiver team.	

The VA’s Caregiver program enables caregivers and Veterans to receive benefit payments from VA. To date, the Caregiver program has focused on post-911 Veterans. The Mission Act calls for the expansion of this program to all eras of Veterans and an IT system to be built in order to support the expansion of the program.

The internal system (CARMA) requires the manual input of paper applications (form 1010-CG). When the Caregiver program expands, the paper process will not scale.  

The Caregiver team is developing an MVP to move the 1010-CG online.  Initial designs have been created and will be coded (probably in staging). We plan on testing these initial designs to make sure we're on the right track prior to pushing to production.

**The goals of this usability study are to:**
- Determine whether or not our MVP prototype of the 10-10CG form is usable and easy to navigate for Veterans and caregivers 
- Determine whether That the caregiver/Veteran have a clear/realistic understanding of requirements and expectations once form is submitted (next steps). 

**The research questions we want to address are:**
- Where is the best place to have this form in the IA?  Where would users want to find it?
- Are users able to navigate through the form easily and without hiccups?
- Is information displayed in a clear and understandable manner (text/components)? 
- Do users understand how to fill in each field?
- Do users have a sense of where they are in the site and within user path?
- Do applicants understand requirements and are next steps transparent? 
- What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form?
- What do users want to happen after submitting the form?

**Our hypothesis**
Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- Clearly understanding when they’re entering veteran information versus caregiver information
- Understanding whether or not the caregiver actually qualifies for this benefit
- Understanding what a secondary caregiver is, and if they should care about that
	
## Method	
A task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom. A remote moderator will begin with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototype. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.  

We will be testing with a coded form in staging or a clickable InVision prototype if the coded form is not ready.

## Participants and Recruitment	

We would like to work with Perigeon to recruit remote users.  We are looking for:

7 Caregivers
- if possible, some who have heard of these benefits and are either already enrolled or in the process of applying or considering applying
- If possible, include 1-2 secondary caregivers

7 Veterans **who have caregivers** 
- mix of pre-911 and post-911 Veterans
- Include a mix of Veterans with a disability rating of 80% or higher
- Include a mix of Veterans who live and do not live with caregivers

## When? 
- We would like to run a pilot session with Perigeon and one of our team members, Justin Linn (jlinn@governmentcio.com) as a pilot participant on January 15th at 1:30pm Eastern.  This should include Jonathan and Shawna and the observers as well (emails below)
- Sessions will take place starting January 16th - 17th and January 20-21st.
- Sessions should last ~45 minutes
- Specific time slots:
   - For January 16th, please schedule sessions between noon - 5pm Eastern time 
   - For the rest of the days, please schedule sessions between 9am - 5pm Eastern time
