# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, April 2021

## Background

This study is being conducted by the VSA Caregiver team.	

The Caregiver team launched the digitized 10-10CG form October 1, 2020. Currently, the team is adding functionality that allows a Veteran’s legal representative to be identified and documentation (e.g. power of attorney) to be optionally uploaded. 
 
Initial designs were created and tested, with some usability issues found. This study is to test a revised design of the sign as representative flow, to validate that the improvements we made will work for our users.

## Goals

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Validate the usability of the updated representative workflow.
- Test the usability of the "upload a document" content and understand what types of documents the user would upload.
- Determine if the cognitive understanding of Primary Family Caregiver versus Secondary Family Caregivers is improved.

### Research questions

The research questions we want to address are: 

- Are users confused by any particular aspect of the representative workflow?
- Does the current representative workflow stop users from completing the form?
- Do the changes to the Primary Family Caregiver versus Secondary Family Caregivers display improve or hinder understanding?
- What types of documents does the user plan to upload?


Our hypothesis: 
- Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
  - The three answer Yes/Yes/No radio options may be confusing to folks
  - People might still not be sure what document to upload


## Methodology 

A task-based usability study will be conducted in staging, remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. 


## Participants and Recruitment

We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 6-7 **fulfilled sessions**. Therefore, we request that 10 sessions be scheduled.  

**Must have for participants**

All participants must be yes to one of the following questions:

- Are you a caregiver to a Veteran?  (must recruit at least 4)

or

- Are you a Veteran who has a caregiver? (must recruit at least 2)

Answer must be yes for 2 participants: 

- Are you a Veteran’s legal representative? 
  - If confused, provide this explanation: A representative is a person who, under applicable law, has authority to act on behalf of the Veteran or who is legally vested with the responsibility or care of the Veteran. Being next of kin or being married to the veteran does not automatically constitute legal representation.

**Good to have for participants**

- At least 2 participants with a disability rating with a disability rating of 70% or greater and identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities 
- At least 1 participant that uses a screen reader
- 50% women, 50% men
- 50% people who identify as an ethnicity/race other Caucasian
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area


**Recruitment requirements**
 
- All must have a laptop/desktop and be willing to be complete the test on said laptop/desktop
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom.


## Timeline 

**Desired Timeline: April 12 - 13th, 2021**

Session length: 45 minutes 

Please leave 15 minutes in between each session.

Notetaking: Please designate someone from Perigeon to take notes
