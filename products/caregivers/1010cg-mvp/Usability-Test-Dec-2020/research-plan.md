# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Primary Caregiver/Secondary flow for the 10-10CG form, December 2020

## Background

This study is being conducted by the VSA Caregiver team.	

The Caregiver team launched the digitized 10-10CG form October 1, 2020. The team is adding the functionality that allows Veterans and caregivers to apply to the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers with either a Primary Family Caregiver, Secondary Family Caregiver(s), or both a Primary and Secondary Family Caregiver(s). 

The designs have been created and coded to address this requirement. A usability test with Veterans and caregivers is needed to determine if these changes are understandable and the form is easy to use. 

## Goals

The goals of this usability study are to: 

Determine whether or not the updated designs of the 10-10CG form are usable,  understandable, and easy navigate for Veterans and caregivers.

### Research questions


The research questions we want to address are: 

- Are users able to achieve their goal of either applying with a: 
	- Primary Family Caregiver
	- Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregiver(s)
	- Secondary Family Caregiver(s) only

- Is there any confusion caused by the content or verbage in regards to the Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregiver workflows?

- Will confusion be caused in any way by the addition of the Primary Family Caregiver question 


Our hypothesis: 

- Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:

	- The addition of the Primary Family Caregiver question may cause confusion
	
	- Knowing if a Veteran or caregiver should “add” a Primary Family Caregiver vs Secondary Family Caregiver 

## Method

A task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom. A remote moderator will begin with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototype. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.  

We will be testing with a coded form in staging. 

- We will ask Veterans to navigate to https://staging.va.gov/family-member-benefits/comprehensive-assistance-for-family-caregivers/ (a link provided in the Zoom chat) and have participants share their screen with us via Zoom.


- Use case 1: Someone to navigate through the form that’s just applying with a primary caregiver. 

- Use case 2: Someone that’s applying with a primary and a secondary caregiver

- Use case 3: Someone that’s applying  with only a secondary caregiver


## Participants and Recruitment

We would like to work with Perigean to Recruit for 12 fulfilled sessions.  

We are looking for 12 folks, a mix of veterans and caregivers.

**Must have for participants**

- Are you a Veteran who has a caregiver? 

Or 

- Are you a caregiver to a Veteran?  

Answer must be yes for 4 participants: 

- Are you currently enrolled in The Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers and are interested in adding another caregiver to your benefits? 

**Good to have for participants**

- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55.
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)

**Recruitment requirements**
 
 All (12) must have a laptop/desktop and be willing to be complete the test on said laptop/desktop
Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom.
