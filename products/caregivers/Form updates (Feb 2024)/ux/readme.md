### Summary
- Updates to the online CG form to a) align with the paper form updates, CARMA processing fields and schema update; and b) align with the latest VADS pattern and component guidance.


### Design Decisions
- Alignment with [DS Social Security Pattern](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/social-security-number)



#### Content Notes
- Will not be updating phone number to "mobile" and "home" labels but will be keeping "primary" and "alternate" due to the application process of staff needing to call the primary number

#### Future Notes

**Relationship to Veteran question**
Content standards are to avoid gendered language whenever possible. We discussed updating with the business and the work to update and align their database fields are not an initiative at this time but they did mention it being on their radar to align with VA-wide standards.

- Have options to select (and in CARMA) and in content be gender neutral.
- Example being: not son or daughter but child, not mother or father but parent.
- Move to own page, one question per page

**Birth sex / gender question**
