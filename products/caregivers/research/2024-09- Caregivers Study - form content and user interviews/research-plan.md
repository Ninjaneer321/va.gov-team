# Research Plan for Health Enrollment, 10-10CG, September 2024

## Background
It's been a few years since a comprehensive research study has been done on the Application for Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers Program (10-10CG). Since then, we've made changes to the form including [updates to facility selection](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Improve%20Facility%20Selection/Improve%20Facility%20Selection%20-%20Initiative%20Brief.md) and [content to match paper form updates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/caregivers/Form%20updates%20(Feb%202024)), but haven't been able to test those updates with users. We'd like to conduct a study to determine if the 10-10CG is providing helpful and relevant content to the caregivers in the most applicable location - before or during the online application, and if the recent changes have improved usability and clarity of content.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports [OCTO's goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md) to make our digital experiences the best way to access VA health care and benefits by ensuring that the process of adding and changing caregivers can be done easily and seamlessly online.

### Veteran Journey
The 10-10CG form can fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) any time between starting up and dying, as a Veteran could be designating a caregiver right after separating from the military due to disabilities from service or could need a caregiver later in life.


## Research Goals	
1. Learn more about caregiver clarification content needs within the form (vs before/outside of).
2. Learn more about the overall experience of multiple people completing one form.
3. Evaluate the usability of the search functionality for locations.

### Outcome
Based on our findings, we will suggest content updates and work with CAIA to improve clarification of the caregiver designation/change process. We will also determine if any changes are needed for the facility selection process, especially for assistive tech users.

### Research questions
1. Learn more about caregiver clarification content needs within the form (vs before/outside of).
   - What knowledge of the caregiver program do Veterans and caregivers typically have before filling out the 10-10CG?
   - How do caregivers, both primary and secondary, perceive the existing form content with regards to understanding eligibility and benefits, and where would additional clarification be helpful?
   - Do users struggle with completing any fields in particular? We'll be especially paying attention to how users react to the new "County" field and social security number requirements.
   - Is there a need or desire for applicants to have an authenticated experience that prefills personal information?

3. Learn more about the overall experience of multiple people completing one form.
	- Who typically completes the form online? Are Veterans and their caregivers signing the form together?
  	- For those who are enrolled, did they sign as a legal representative and what was that experience like?
  
4. Evaluate the usability of the search functionality for locations.
	- Can sighted and assistive tech users easily use the search input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
  	- Can users easily navigate a long list of search results?
   	- Can users easily do a second search or new search from the search results page?
   	- Is the new facility selection pattern easy for the participant to understand why they are selecting a facility and how it impacts the caregiver application process?
   	- How do users react to their facility selection on the confirmation page?


### Hypothesis
- We assume there is missing helpful information for caregiver applicants around what they are eligible for and what benefits they get. We think this study will inform content changes we should make as a result to increase clarity of the caregiver program within the form.
- We assume there are a variety of dyad applicant combos and those groups most often have pain points around the personal information and signing handoff process. We anticipate it might be easier if each applicant could complete their own personal information and sign independently.
- Based on what we know about the caregiver journey, we assume that all applicants have multiple other VA touch points and forms completed which gives them a general understanding of the caregiver program and benefits before completing the 10-10CG.

## Methodology	
We will conduct remote moderated usability studies via Zoom using the current production form once facility updates are ready on the 10-10CG.
**Need to confirm with team if CG facility updates will be ready soon so we can test usability in this study. Backup plan would be to use a prototype for facility updates and get feedback on content but this wouldn't allow us to test with AT users or test usability of facility search.**

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this study is recently appointed caregivers and Veterans with high disability ratings who need some assistance from others for daily activities (and therefore may have a caregiver appointed or are eligible to have one).

We will split this study into two cohorts:

- Cohort 1 (10-15 participants): Caregivers recently enrolled in the caregiver program (as recent as possible), with or without their Veteran pair
	- We'll ask for approximate date of caregiver enrollment in the screener questions to narrow it down to the newest caregivers and to show the breakdown in reporting afterwards.
- Cohort 2 (10-15 participants): Veterans with a disability rating of over 70% who need some assistance to complete daily activities and/or need someone to live with them for help. We will require at least two completed sessions with assistive tech users for cohort 2.

Since we have restrictive criteria for this study and a limited pool of caregivers and severely disabled Veterans to recruit, we'll request that Perigean gather participants who meet the primary criteria first and then aim for maximum variability in all other recruiting factors within the group of applicants who qualify for the study.

### Recruitment criteria
Total participants: 20-30

Cohort 1: 10-15 participants (minimum of 10, maximum of 15 if Perigean is able to recruit that many particiants meeting our criteria)

Cohort 2: Same numbers as Cohort 1

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

**Cohort 1: Caregivers**
- Must identify role as "caregiver"
- We'd mainly like to recruit newer caregivers (enrolled in the past year or so) so we'd like Perigean to gather dates of caregiver enrollment and choose the newest caregivers they get responses from.

Screener questions:
1. "Are you enrolled as a caregiver in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC)?" (Answer should be yes to qualify for cohort 1.)
2. "Approximately when did you enroll in the VA caregiver program?" (Date picker with month and year) **Please choose the most recently appointed caregivers according to responses from this question.**

**Cohort 2: Veterans with high disability ratings who need some assistance from others**
- Must identify role as Veteran
- Must have a disability rating of 70% or higher
- Must require some assistance from other to complete daily activities
- Recruit four assistive tech users - at least two AT sessions are needed for this study to be complete

Screener questions:
1. "Does your disability require you to need help or assistance from someone else to complete daily activities?" (Answer should be yes to qualify for cohort 2.)
2. "Do you need to use screen reader technology to use the internet, such as VoiceOver on an iPhone, TalkBack on an Android device, or JAWS on a computer?" (answer should be yes to qualify as an assistive tech user for cohort 2.)
	- If yes, ask the following question as well: "Please list the name of the screen reader technology you will use during the session." (Free text field for response) This doesn't qualify or disqualify and is meant for researchers' awareness and to encourage people to join using the assistive technology they reported in the screener.


**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- Diversity across age groups
- Diversity across racial identities
- Diversity across education levels
- Diversity across sexual orientation
- Diversity across gender identity
- Diversity across rural and major metropolitan areas
