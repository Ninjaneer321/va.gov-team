# Research Plan for Health Enrollment, 10-10CG, September 2024

## Background
It's been a few years since a comprehensive research study has been done on the Application for Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers Program (10-10CG). Since then, we've made changes to the form including [updates to facility selection](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Improve%20Facility%20Selection/Improve%20Facility%20Selection%20-%20Initiative%20Brief.md) and [content to match paper form updates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/caregivers/Form%20updates%20(Feb%202024)), but haven't been able to test those updates with users. We'd like to conduct a study to determine if the 10-10CG is providing helpful and relevant content to the caregivers in the most applicable location - before or during the online application, and if the recent changes have improved usability and clarity of content.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports [OCTO's goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md) to make our digital experiences the best way to access VA health care and benefits by ensuring that the process of adding and changing caregivers can be done easily and seamlessly online.

### Veteran Journey
The 10-10CG form can fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) any time between starting up and dying, as a Veteran could be designating a caregiver right after separating from the military due to disabilities from service or could need a caregiver later in life.


## Research Goals	
1. Learn more about caregiver clarification content needs within the form (vs before/outside of).
2. Learn more about the overall experience of multiple people completing one form.
3. Evaluate the usability of the search functionality for locations.

### Outcome
Based on our findings, we will suggest content updates and work with CAIA to improve clarification of the caregiver designation/change process. We will also determine if any changes are needed for the facility selection process, especially for assistive tech users.

### Research questions
1. Learn more about caregiver clarification content needs within the form (vs before/outside of).
   - What knowledge of the caregiver program do Veterans and caregivers typically have before filling out the 10-10CG?
   - How do caregivers, both primary and secondary, perceive the existing form content with regards to understanding eligibility and benefits, and where would additional clarification be helpful?
   - Is there a need or desire for applicants to have an authenticated experience that prefills personal information?

3. Learn more about the overall experience of multiple people completing one form.
	- Who typically completes the form online? Are Veterans and their caregivers signing the form together?
  	- For those who are enrolled, did they sign as a legal representative and what was that experience like?
  
4. Evaluate the usability of the search functionality for locations.
	- Can sighted and assistive tech users easily use the search input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
  	- Can users easily navigate a long list of search results?
   	- Can users easily do a second search or new search from the search results page?
   	- Is the new facility selection pattern easy for the participant to understand why they are selecting a facility and how it impacts the caregiver application process?
   	- How do users react to their facility selection on the confirmation page?


### Hypothesis
- We assume there is missing helpful information for caregiver applicants around what they are eligible for and what benefits they get. We think this study will inform content changes we should make as a result to increase clarity of the caregiver program within the form.
- We assume there are a variety of dyad applicant combos and those groups most often have pain points around the personal information and signing handoff process. We anticipate it might be easier if each applicant could complete their own personal information and sign independently.
- Based on what we know about the caregiver journey, we assume that all applicants have multiple other VA touch points and forms completed which gives them a general understanding of the caregiver program and benefits before completing the 10-10CG.

## Methodology	
We will conduct remote moderated usability studies via Zoom using the current production form once facility updates are ready on the 10-10CG.

We will split this study into two cohorts:

- Cohort 1: Caregivers currently enrolled in the caregiver program, with or without their Veteran pair
	- Ask when they enrolled to show the breakdown in reporting but don't limit to new caregivers
 	- Ask for some recently appointed caregivers
- Cohort 2: Veterans with a disability rating of over 70% who need some assistance to complete daily activities and/or need someone to live with them for help
- Need to get assistive tech users for both
- 10-15 people each cohort

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this study is recently appointed caregivers, Veterans who have caregivers appointed, and 


Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
