## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Jessica/Angela] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, some things I want to mention:

Today we're going to talk about the application for the **Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers**. We have some questions for you about this and then we would like you to share your screen and go through using the online form in our test site. We will use our demo site so you won't be actually submitting an application today. 
 


- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem; just let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ and Caregivers' experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Interview Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the caregiver program online form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions about your [caregiver/Veteran] application experience.

    - If no: [Skip ahead to not enrolled interview questions]



##### If yes, Questions:

## First Task: [Introduction page] - 5 minutes

- Thank you for sharing that background. Now let's change gears a bit.
- I'm going to share a link to our staging site with you in the chat and when you're ready have you share your screen in Zoom with me.

- This is our staging site for testing purposes so you don't have to worry about the information that you enter going anywhere. Feel free to use fake information for sensitive items such as your social or birth date that you don't want to share {and I will provide you some information to enter.}
- As you go through the form please remember to think aloud. We want to hear about any reactions you're having.

- How would you prefer to search for VA facilities?
- Why do you think facility choice is part of the caregiver application process?
- Let's imagine you want to change the facility you have selected - maybe because you're moving soon - by doing a new search. Can you walk me through how you would accomplish that?

- Would you sit down and complete this form together?
- Would you prefer to have help completing this from an accredited representative or someone else from the VA? Why or why not?

- [Does the participant seem confused or express that anything on this page is unclear?]
- [Does the participant proceed to the upload page or initially answer the Veteran would sign?]


## Task: [Review + Submit] - 5 minutes

- Please look over this page and tell me about your initial impressions or expectations.
- If you saw something you entered by mistake, show me how you would go about correcting that.

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans and for Caregivers too.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
