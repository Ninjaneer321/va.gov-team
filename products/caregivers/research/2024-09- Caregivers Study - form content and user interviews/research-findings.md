## Research Goals
1. Learn more about a caregiver's understanding of the PCAFC program before filling out the 10-10CG to determine if recent content updates have improved comprehension of the program and if additional content changes would be helpful at this stage in the caregiver journey.
2. Learn more about the overall experience of multiple people completing one form.
3. Evaluate the usability of the new facility search functionality and confirmation screen content.


## Research Questions
* Learn more about a caregiver's understanding of the PCAFC program before filling out the 10-10CG to determine if recent content updates have improved comprehension of the program and if additional content changes would be helpful at this stage in the caregiver journey.
    * What knowledge of the caregiver program do Veterans and caregivers typically have before filling out the 10-10CG?
    * How do caregivers, both primary and secondary, perceive the existing form content with regards to understanding eligibility and benefits, and where would additional clarification be helpful?
    * Do users struggle with completing any fields in particular? We'll be especially paying attention to how users react to the new "County" field and social security number requirements.
    * Is there a need or desire for applicants to have an authenticated experience that pre-fills personal information?

* Learn more about the overall experience of multiple people completing one form.
    * Who typically completes the form online? Are Veterans and their caregivers signing the form together?
    * For those who are enrolled, did they sign as a legal representative and what was that experience like?
    * Are there places in the form where users get confused by the content switching point of view between the Veteran and various caregiver roles and/or who "you" refers to in the form questions?
    * Do users correctly notice when labels for form fields are asking for a specific person's information?
   
* Evaluate the usability of the new facility search functionality and confirmation screen content.
    * Can sighted and assistive tech users easily use the search input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
    * Can users easily navigate a long list of search results?
    * Can users easily do a second search or new search from the search results page?
    * Is the new facility selection pattern easy for the participant to understand why they are selecting a facility and how it impacts the caregiver application process?
    * How do users react to their facility selection on the confirmation page?

## Methodology 
We conducted remote moderated usability studies via Zoom from October 1 - 18, 2014 using the VA.gov staging environment for the 10-10CG starting at the form introduction page. This enabled us to test the form without any risk of applications being submitted in production, test with accessible technology users, and test updates to the facility selection step that were not yet in production.

We recruited 2 cohorts of participants:

* Caregivers - Cohort 1 (completed 13 of 22 scheduled sessions)
* Veterans - Cohort 2 (completed 7 of 12 scheduled sessions and 1 external pilot participant)


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**Hypothesis 1:** We assume there is missing helpful information for caregiver applicants around what they are eligible for and what benefits they get. We think this study will inform content changes we should make as a result to increase clarity of the caregiver program within the form.

* Definitely True
* A key finding was that over half of participants called out wanting to know if they were eligible and for what exactly before they would complete the form. 
* Participants wanted more information pertaining to the difference between secondary and primary caregiver benefits. There was repeated confusion about what a secondary caregiver is and what the benefits are of being one.

**Hypothesis 2:** We assume there are a variety of dyad applicant combos and those groups most often have pain points around the personal information and signing handoff process. We anticipate it might be easier if each applicant could complete their own personal information and sign independently.

* Likely True
* A key finding was that Veterans and Caregivers had mixed comfortability about signing for others if they were not there in person. This varied by personal preference and applicant combos. 
* 9 out of 13 Caregivers and 3 out of 8 Veterans were comfortable signing the form for people not physically present
* 4 out of 13 Caregivers and 5 out of 8 Veterans were not comfortable or unsure of signing for people not physically present
* We found that Caregivers were more comfortable and prepared to complete the form themselves than Veterans.
    * 7 of 13 Caregivers said they would have all the necessary information for the Veteran and secondary caregivers on-hand.
    * 7 Caregivers and 2 Veterans expressed that they would pause to contact the people they were signing the form for or wait until they could be present, and 2 participants specifically mentioned wanting to save the form and come back to it.
    * 7 of 8 Veterans would want at least 1 other caregiver present/in person to submit the application.

**Hypothesis 3:** Based on what we know about the caregiver journey, we assume that all applicants have multiple other VA touch points and forms completed which gives them a general understanding of the caregiver program and benefits before completing the 10-10CG.

* Likely False
* The majority of participants found information about the caregiver program before applying on VA.gov, through word of mouth from other Veterans and Caregivers, and through their medical providers. VA.gov is the primary place people are looking for a comprehensive description of the program and eligibility criteria.

**Hypothesis 4:** We assume that the county field in the address will create pause and some confusion with participants based on business feedback of applications having a version of USA (country) entered. 

* Maybe True
* There was some pause/confusion around the field and why it was being asked, but overall most participants entered a county correctly. There was new hint text and validation in place before this study went live, and business data has suggested that those changes have reduced the frequency of the issue on the processing end. 
* 11 of 13 Caregivers entered a county correctly
* 2 of 13 Caregivers entered USA initially (one with "United state" variation got through, one corrected after error)
* 7 of 8 Veterans entered correctly/easily 
* 1 of 8 Veterans initially entered USA and received a validation error



## Key Findings

1. Veterans and Caregivers want more clarity on eligibility and benefits before applying.
2. Veterans and Caregivers had mixed comfortability with and ease of signing the form.
3. Users said content was “just enough” but called out items that needed more clarification.
4. The facility search functionality was difficult / confusing for some users.
5. Veterans and Caregivers differ on facilities confirmation page content clarity.

**Finding 1: Veterans and Caregivers want more clarity on eligibility and benefits before applying.**

Labels: TREND: Content 

Both Veterans and Caregivers expressed confusion and frustration with determining exactly what the caregiver program entails, understanding their eligibility status before applying, and wanting more clarity on the benefits of the program.

Out of 21 total participants:

* 11 participants said they would want to know or would check if they are eligible for the program before completing the form.
* 10 participants expressed confusion about the caregiver program and what it entails in general.
* The majority of participants found information about the caregiver program before applying on VA.gov, through word of mouth from other Veterans and Caregivers, and through their medical providers. The website is the primary place people are looking for a comprehensive description of the program and eligibility criteria.

> _P21: "I would want to know right away if I qualify or not - whether to start the form or not."_ <br>

> _P3: "I don't understand the two different types of programs. There's the paid side and the unpaid side (the general, basic program I'm a part of). I wanted to apply for the stipend side. When I was denied (the stipend) I was confused about it. The only thing I could say about applying is trying to understand EXACTLY what I'm applying for, and make it clear there's two sides to the program."_ <br>

> _P12: "I tell you, they keep that Caregivers program a big secret. Anyone you ask they say 'go see this person, go see that person.'"_ <br>
