- [Info from Carnetta Scruggs re: signatures](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/caregivers/discovery/research/signatures-vha)

     - Not really that helpful, but a little background on using a checkbox.  It used to be a thing on VA to check the box, then have the person authenticate again to verify it was them.  This is no longer a thing on VA.
