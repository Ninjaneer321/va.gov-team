### UX Decisions - 10-10CG

| Date | Decision Maker(s) | Description of Decision | Rationale |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| 1/28/2025 | Angela Agosto, Lois Lewis, Heather Justice | We will back off on our recommendations to provide more information about eligibility and benefits for PCAFC on VA.gov for now. | Our CG stakeholders have firmly stated that they are not interested in providing any additional info about eligibility since this can change over time. They also do not want to provide any additional info about the process because it can vary depending on each specific case. We decided to stop pushing on these recommendations so as to not cause any rifts with our stakeholders and to be respectful that they know the business better than us and have their reasons for not wanting to make these changes. |
