# Identifying top questions in Ask VA using VA TryOpenAI
Last updated by @beckyphung: March 10, 2025 

This doc describes using VA TryOpenAI to identify top VA customer support questions submitted through Ask VA. VA TryOpenAI is a pilot VA-internal generative AI chat.
 
**Key takeaways**
-	**Quicker results**: This was a lot faster than manual tagging.
-	**Less trustworthy**: We don’t know how the LLM determined the results. I followed up with questions and checked the original dataset if an answer seemed inaccurate. 
-	**Limited data input**: I originally tried to input a full day’s worth of questions, but it stopped generating a response when I did this. 
-	**Overall**: This process can be more useful for smaller datasets. You should take steps to double-check results as much as you can.

## Potential use case
### Add links that answer top questions to VA.gov support pages
-	**Problem**: We can only categorize questions by the Category, Topic, and Subtopic submitters choose for each question. See the Power BI report that shows this. People also may spend days waiting for a response rather than getting the answer directly from VA.gov
-	**Opportunity**: By identify specific top questions, we can identify top VA.gov content pages that answer those questions. Then we can add links to those content pages on places where people seek customer support. Pages could include the Ask VA landing page or VA.gov Contact us page.
 
### Update content on VA.gov pages and digital tools 
-	**Problem**: Content on VA.gov pages or digital tools might not always easily answer people’s questions. 
-	**Opportunity**: If we can determine common recurring questions, we can organize content more effectively and help people find answers quicker. 

## Dataset details
- Date: 3/5/2025
- Rows of data/Questions submitted: 1000
- Character count: 316618

This is only a subset of data from 3/5/2025. The chatbot stopped generating a response when I tried to input questions from the entire day (2023 questions/582109 characters).

I also very minimally cleaned the data. This included removing line breaks and added a number to the start of each question. In retrospect, I could have appended the original inquiry number to each question. The inquiry number contains 17 characters and would have added more length to the question though.

## Prompt
Identify the top 5 questions people ask VA based on this dataset of questions people have sent to VA in the following format. The Question ID is the number in front of the question (ex: 1.).
 
1. [Top question formatted as a question]
- Estimated number of questions: [Number of questions]
- [Example question] [Question ID]

## Top questions
These were the top questions people asked: 
- When will I receive my benefits or payments?
- How can I check the status of my application or claim?
- How do I update my information (e.g., name, address, direct deposit)?
- How do I get a copy of my Certificate of Eligibility (COE)?
- What are the benefits and eligibility criteria for dependents?
   -  Note: I don't trust this last theme around dependents as much because the example questions don't match the top-level question.

## Connecting top questions to VA.gov pages
I’m omitting the last theme because some of the example questions didn’t match the theme. So I don’t trust it as much.

## Other takeaways
### Stopped generating answer when asking for too much in the prompt.
-	Original prompts included: 
   - “Provide a complete list of question IDs that apply to each top question.”
   - “Provide 3 example questions exactly as provided from the dataset for each top question and their corresponding ID. Do not change these example questions in any way. Also provide an estimate of the number of questions that apply to each top question.”
### Provide a response, but didn’t include everything in the prompt
- Original prompt: 
   - “Identify the top 5 questions people ask VA based on this dataset of questions people have sent to VA. Format the top 5 questions as a question. Each question starts with a Question ID (ex: 366.). Provide 3 example questions for each top question and their corresponding Question ID. Also provide an estimate of the number of questions that apply to each top question. Order the top questions from most frequently asked to least frequently asked”
