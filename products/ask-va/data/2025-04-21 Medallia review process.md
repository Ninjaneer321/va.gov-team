# Medallia review process

Last updated by @tygindraux: April 21, 2025

This document describes how we plan to review Medallia feedback to improve Ask VA. It will evolve as we streamline processes and iron out details between teams.

## Types of feedback

We collect qualitative unmoderated feedback from submitters and staff who use Ask VA.

These different types of feedbacka are often referred to as:

- VSignals: Feedback from Veterans or other submitters who use Ask VA
- ESignals: Feedback from staff who answer inquiries and support the delivery of Ask VA

VSignals and ESignals are both powered by Medallia.

## During launch

### Frequency

During launch, we will review feedback daily. We will focus on VSignals feedback.

### Process

1. Becky will export VSignals feedback to Excel daily.
2. Towards the   end of each day, Becky and Tyler will review asynchronously and highlight any notable items from the daily export. (Becky will also monitor in real-time to report any urgent issues.)
3. Becky and/or Tyler will post any notable feedback on the #ask-va-integration Slack channel, including any relevant details, suggested action items, questions and tag relevant team members/
4. Relevant team members will discuss the issue in a Slack thread. Once we agree on any action item(s), we will tag Ariel to create a ticket.
5. After a ticket is created, we will add a link to the ticket in the Excel feedback sheet, so we track how we're responding to notable feedback.

## After launch

### Frequency

After launch, we will continue to monitor feedback near-daily. Once feedback starts to stabilize, we will move to reviewing every 2 weeks. Eventually, we expect to review feedback monthly.

### Process

We need to define our exact process, but we think that:

- VA.gov team will be responsible for monitoring, reviewing and sharing insights from VSignals.
- CRM team will be responsible for monitoring, reviewing and sharing insights from ESignals.
- Both teams will share and learn from the partner team's findings.
- We will focus on sharing a high-level summary between teams, but all team members should have access to the Excel sheet where the data has been exported.
- We need to consider who is responsible for sharing feedback with business lines, how often and in what format. We think that business lines could benefit from a high-level summary of feedback from both submitters and other staff. They should know who to contact for more details, if they want them, but the focus will be high-level, actionable feedback.
