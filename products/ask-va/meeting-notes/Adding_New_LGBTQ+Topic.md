## Meeting notes from our talk with Lexi from the LGBTQ+ health program
- Meeting: 7/10/2024
- Attendees: Lexi Matza, Becky Phung, Chris Clemmons, CeeCee O'Connor, Terri Hollar, Megan Sidde, Jaime Rocha, Tamara Kanterman

## Current contact option for the office:
- Email address that is made available to Veterans on the website and from Care Coordinators.
- 9 staff members currently manage responses. Approximately a few a week, volume does change based on launches and other activities.

## Questions:
* What question could an LGBTQ+ health program agent answer that another agent couldn't answer? 
  - They answer questions around policy impacts as well as questions about gender affirming care. They also handle patient complaints.
* What is the goal in utilizing Ask VA?
  - Currently it is difficult to track and report back on inquiries.
  - The shared distro list isn't an efficient manner to communicate with the Veterans.

## Next steps:
- Regroup after launching Ask VA on the VA.gov platform (Jan 2025)
