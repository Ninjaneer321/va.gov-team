# Ask VA variation points
Last updated by @beckyphung: September 24, 2024

This document shows the different points at which the Ask VA form and dashboard changes. Our team is using this document to ensure we have adequate test coverage before we launch the redesigned Ask VA front-end on VA.gov in January 2025. 

We're drafting test scripts based on this document. They'll either be automated or manual, depending on what we can automate before launch.
