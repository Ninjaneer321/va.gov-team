# Follow-up email to send after a question is closed

Ask VA VA.gov Team

Last updated by @tygindraux: January 30, 2025

## About this document
We will send a follow-up email to every submitter after a question is marked as ‘Solved’ (or ‘Replied’) by an agent. This will allow us to capture inquiry specific feedback after the last step in a user’s journey. 

We can use this feedback to learn whether replies from VA are helping submitters complete the tasks they set out to do.

There is more information about this initiative in [Phase 2: Initiatives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Phase%202%3A%20Initiatives.md).

## Email content

Note: This content has not been reviewed by the VA.gov content team yet.

> Dear [Submitter First Name],
>
> Thank you for contacting the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.
>
> We recently replied to your question. We would like to learn about your experience using Ask VA. Please reply to this email and let us know:
>
> - How was your experience contacting VA?
> - Did our reply help answer your question?
>

Note: I’m not sure whether we plan to include a link to a feedback survey? Or, if we plan to ask people to respond directly to this email? I also don’t know how open-ended we’d like to leave these questions and/or if we want to prioritize just asking whether our reply helped answer the question.

## Implementation approach

Note: This will be completed by product with support from engineering and the CRM team. We should build on any exploration we’ve already done related to VA Notify
