## Background

## Proposed approach

### Recommend a shorter list of categories, topics and subtopics based on a question

## Next steps

These steps focus on design work. We may add to or amend these next steps as we move forward.

|Focus|Task|Ticket|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`Categories` `Links`|Move question to the start of the form and consider any implications||
|`Categories`|Design updated category, topic and subtopic pages that recommend 1 or more option||
|`Categories`|Update confirmation page to confirm receiving team based on routing queue||
|`Links`|Determine the right moment(s) to offer helpful links||
|`Links`|Design page or component to offer helpful links or continue with form||
|`Categories` `Links`|Design and place alert that lets people know that a suggestion is based on other similar questions||

- Include descriptions on category, topic and subtopic radio buttons
- Include additional information component that lets people know what a category, topic and subtopic determine
