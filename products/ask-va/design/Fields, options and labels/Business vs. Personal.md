## Business vs. Personal
This doc explains when inquiries are categorized as Business or Personal. AKA when the Level of Authentication field = Business or Personal.

## Rules
### For questions for the “Education benefits and work study” category
1. When a user selects Education benefits and work studay category 
2. and answers "What is your relationship to the Veteran?" by selecting "I'm connected to the Veteran through my work (for example, as a SCO, or fiduciary)
3. Then the question will always be categorized as "general question" on the CRM inquiry record.

### For all other questions
- For Who is your question about?
  - Select Someone else
  - Do not select “It’s a general question” for non-Education questions. Because then, the relationship question will not appear.
- For What is your relationship to the Veteran?, select: 
  - I'm connected to the Veteran through my work (for example, as a School Certifying Official or fiduciary)
