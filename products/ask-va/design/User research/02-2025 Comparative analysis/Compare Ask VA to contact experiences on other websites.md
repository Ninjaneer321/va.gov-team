# Compare Ask VA to contact experiences on other websites

Ask VA VA.gov Team

Last updated by @tygindraux: February 12, 2025

## Purpose

### Research goals

- Review how other websites provide help before asking someone to submit an inquiry
- Review how many fields are included on other websites' contact forms
- Review how other websites ask for information that lets them categorize or route an inquiry
- Review how being signed in (or not) changes the experience of contacting another organization online

### Outcome

This will help us articulate the things we like or donâ€™t like and which direction to go with Ask VA. It will feed into product vision exercises we plan to do with partners.

### Methodology

1. Identify websites to compare.
2. Review the contact experience on the website.
3. Compare to Ask VA.

## Analysis

I reviewed the following contact experiences:
- [GOV.UK/Contact](https://www.gov.uk/contact)
- [Government of Canada Contact Us](https://www.canada.ca/en/contact.html)
- [National Grid Contact Form](https://www.nationalgridus.com/NY-Home/Contact-Us/)
- [USAJOBS.gov Help Center](https://help.usajobs.gov/how-to)
- [Con Edison Contact Us](https://www.coned.com/en/contact-us)
- [RNID Contact Us](https://rnid.org.uk/about-us/contact-rnid/)
- [Atlassian Contact Form](https://www.atlassian.com/company/contact)
- [Grammarly Contact Us](https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new#/)

After reviewing each website, I re-imagined Ask VA as if it worked like ___ contact experience.

### GOV.UK/Contact

If Ask VA worked like GOV.UK/Contact, then:

- VA.gov would have specific contact pages set up for each service. These would be different to hub or information pages.
- For example, there would be a contact page for education benefits and work study and a contact page for life insurance.
- The life insurance contact page would have links to information or tasks followed by contact information.
- People would be directed to get in touch via phone, mail, chatbot or complete a task online. Whenever possible, they would be directed to complete tasks.
- The only contact form we may have would be a form to contact VA.gov about website issues. You wouldn't need to sign in to use it. There would be 3 fields and you would have the option to receive a reply or not. You would not receive a reference number and it wouldn't be clear how long it takes to receive a reply.
- Some services may have their own contact tool which looks like a form, but it's not something you submit. For example, if NCA had a contact tool, the first question would ask, "How can we help you today?" with around 7 options. Your answer would direct you to a follow-up question or eventually a contact page for NCA that also includes tasks.
- Whether you are authenticated or not, your contact experience would be the same. However, you do need to sign in to complete certain tasks, like file taxes.

### Government of Canada Contact Us

If Ask VA worked like Government of Canada, then:

- VA.gov would have specific contact pages set up for each service. These would be different to hub or information pages.

- People would be directed to get in touch via phone, mail, chatbot or complete a task online. Whenever possible, they would be directed to complete tasks.
- There would also be an option to 'get general help' either 'by telephone' or 'by email.' If you choose by email, you fill out and submit a contact form.
- The contact form (Ask VA) includes 10 fields, 7 are required and 3 are optional. It has 9 categories with 1-6 topics in each category.
- Sometimes a category don't contain a topic and instead gives you a link to book an appointment, for example. The goal is to get you to complete a task, whenever possible.
- After you submit your question, you receive a reference number. You should receive a phone call within 2 business days.
- Whether you are authenticated or not, your contact experience would be the same. However, you do need to sign in to complete certain tasks, like booking some appointments.

- The form includes 8 fields. It asks you to choose a category from 9 options. There are 0-7 topics within 2 of the categories.
- After you submit your question, you  receive a reference number. You will receive a response via email.

### USAJOBS.gov Help Center

If Ask VA worked like USAJOBS.gov, then:

- Benefits and other information pages on VA.gov would link to Ask VA.
- If you choose to contact VA.gov instead of find information or complete a task online, you will fill out a form (Ask VA) to request assistance by phone or email.
- The form includes 5 fields, 4 are required and 1 is optional (telephone). There is no categorization, in other words, you don't choose a category or topic.
- After you submit your question, you don't receive a reference number but it does tell you a ticket has been created. You should receive a response in 1 business day.

### RNID Contact us

If Ask VA worked like RNID, then:

- VA.gov's Contact us page would first encourage you to use other tools to complete tasks online, before contacting VA.
- The Contact us page would be categorized by channel. Ask us a question (Ask VA) would be described as an online form and deprioritized on the contact page.
- The contact form includes 5 fields: 4 required, 1 optional. It is optional, but the contact form let's you choose from 13 topics.
- You don't receive a reference number if you submit a contact form, this is different to a ticketing system. You will receive an email within 1 to 5 working days.

- As you go through the form, you would be given an automated solution before you submit a request. You could still choose to submit the request if their solution didn't help.
- Depending on what your question is about, the solution may direct you to complete a task online, like read an FAQ or book an appointment.
- If you choose to submit the request, you don't receive a reference number. It's unclear how long it will take to hear back over email.
