# Compare Ask VA to contact experiences on other websites

Ask VA VA.gov Team

Last updated by @tygindraux: February 12, 2025

## Purpose

### Research goals

- Review how other websites provide help before asking someone to submit an inquiry
- Review how many fields are included on other websites' contact forms
- Review how other websites ask for information that lets them categorize or route an inquiry
- Review how being signed in (or not) changes the experience of contacting another organization online

### Outcome

This will help us articulate the things we like or donâ€™t like and which direction to go with Ask VA. It will feed into product vision exercises we plan to do with partners.

### Methodology

1. Identify websites to compare.
2. Review the contact experience on the website.
3. Compare to Ask VA.

## Analysis

I reviewed the following contact experiences:
- [GOV.UK/Contact](https://www.gov.uk/contact)
- [Government of Canada Contact Us](https://www.canada.ca/en/contact.html)
- [USAJOBS.gov Help Center](https://help.usajobs.gov/how-to)
- [Con Edison Contact Us](https://www.coned.com/en/contact-us)
- [National Grid Contact Form](https://www.nationalgridus.com/NY-Home/Contact-Us/)
- [RNID Contact Us](https://rnid.org.uk/about-us/contact-rnid/)
- [Atlassian Contact Form](https://www.atlassian.com/company/contact)
- [Grammarly Contact Us](https://support.grammarly.com/hc/en-us/requests/new#/)

### If Ask VA worked like GOV.UK/Contact

- VA.gov would have specific contact pages set up for each service. These would be different to hub or information pages.
- For example, there would be a contact page for education benefits and work study and a contact page for life insurance.
- The life insurance contact page would have links to information or tasks followed by contact information.
- People would be directed to get in touch via phone, mail, chatbot or complete a task online. Whenever possible, they would be directed to complete tasks.
- The only contact form we may have would be a form to contact VA.gov about website issues. You wouldn't need to sign in to use it. There would be 3 fields and you would have the option to receive a reply or not. You would not receive a reference number and it wouldn't be clear how long it takes to receive a reply.
- Some services may have their own contact tool which looks like a form, but it's not something you submit. For example, if NCA had a contact tool, the first question would ask, "How can we help you today?" with around 7 options. Your answer would direct you to a follow-up question or eventually a contact page for NCA that also includes tasks.
- Whether you are authenticated or not, your contact experience would be the same. However, you do need to sign in to complete certain tasks, like file taxes.
