## Purpose

### Research goals

- Review how support channels are described and distinguished from one another
- Review how teams measure the success of each support channel (where possible)
- Review the steps required to receive help from each support channel

### Outcome

This will help us articulate when people should use Ask VA instead of another support channel. And consider whether we need to design better seams between Ask VA and other channels. It will feed into product vision exercises we plan to do with partners.

### Methodology

1. Identify channels to compare.
2. Review support experience of each channel.
3. Compare to Ask VA.

## Analysis

I reviewed the following support channels:

- [My HealtheVet Secure Messaging (MHV SM)](https://www.va.gov/health-care/secure-messaging/)
- [VA chatbot](https://www.va.gov/contact-us/virtual-agent/)
- [My HealtheVet (MHV) contact form](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/contact-mhv)
- [VET-HOME Inquiry](https://vethome.va.gov/inquiry/)
- MyVA411 main information line
- VA benefits hotline
- VA health benefits hotline
- GI Bill hotline
- National Call Center for Homeless Veterans
- My HealtheVet help desk

I reviewed each channel and took notes in [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1738276336649/31f5cc8b2eb56f67173d0318e5e38bda887b53bd). (Note: You may not have access to this Mural board.) 

### My HealtheVet Secure Messaging (MHV SM)

**Purpose.** My HealtheVet Secure Messaging (MHV) is described as a way to "communicate privately online with your VA health care team." It's for non-urgent health-related questions. And takes up to 3 business days to receive a reply. You can use MHV SM to do things like request VA referrals, test results and prescriptions, manage VA health appointments, and get health care updates. If you have other questions, that MHV SM can't help with, they direct you to FAQs or the MHV help desk (phone number) or MHV contact form. There is no link to Ask VA.

**Metrics.** From a glance, this team measures engagement rates and bounce rates with the goal of increasing Veterans' involvement in managing their health care and adoption of SM.

**Steps.** You can use MHV SM, if you're enrolled in VA health care, are registered as a patient at a VA health facility and your provider has agreed to communicate with your through SM. After you sign in, you can write messages, save drafts, review your sent messages and keep a record of your conversations. You send a message by filling out a 'form' on one page. You choose a team, then a category (from a list of 6 options). Then you fill in a subject, question and attach a document (optional).

### VA chatbot

**Purpose.** VA chatbot is a "resource to help you quickly find information about VA benefits and services. You won't communicate with an actual representative." You can use the VA chatbot to get information about VA benefits and services. However, it's only trained to answer general question about a few topics, like health care, sign in and prescriptions. They have taken content and re-written it in a conversational format, which is resource-intensive. So, this is part of the reason you can only ask about a few subjects right now. If you can't get help through chatbot, then you're encouraged to call a VA phone number, use Ask VA or explore other content online.

**Metrics.** From a glance, this team measures engagement rates, satisfaction rates, perceived requirements and content requests. The goal is to decrease time Veterans spend waiting and make it easier for them to self-serve, and decrease call center volume.

**Steps.** You shouldn't share "any personal information, such as your name, address or anything else that can be used to identify you." To start, it gives you examples of questions you can ask, like, 'What's the PACT Act?' or, 'What is my claim status?' Then, it tries to answer your question and shares a link to more information. Or, if it can't help, it asks you rephrase your question and choose from a list of  options. After it attempts to answer your question, it asks, 'Did that answer your question' and you can choose 'Yes' or 'No.'

### My HealtheVet (MHV) contact form

**Purpose.** My HealtheVet contact form is for when 'you need help, want to alert us to a concern, share information about a feature, or tell us how we're doing.' Your question should be 'related to the My HealtheVet website.' Before you use the contact form, it suggests answers to common questions. Then it says, 'If you need additional help, send us details using the Contact Us form.' This form is for non-urgent questions. Their goal is to reply within a day, or up to 3 business days. 

**Steps.** The form is on one page and includes 9 required fields, 4 optional fields and 2 conditional fields. You choose a topic, first, from a list of 8 options, including 'Other.' Then, you choose a category from a static list of 5 options, regardless of your topic. You receive an inquiry number after you submit the form and your response will be via email or phone, depending on what you choose.

### VET-HOME Inquiry

**Purpose.** VET-HOME's contact form is a way 'to schedule an environmental health registry evaluation or contact VET-HOME coordinators about other environmental exposure related inquiries.' If you choose certain topics at the start of the form, it will redirect you to information on VA.gov instead.

**Steps.** The form is on one page and includes 9 required fields, 11 optional fields and multiple conditional fields. First, you choose a topic from a list of 7 options. Depending on which topic you choose, you may need to give additional information. Depending on how you identify yourself, you may need to fill in additional or different fields. For example, if you're a VSO, it asks for your organization. After you submit the form, you receive a confirmation message. They respond within 5 business days. If you need a faster response, they suggest that you call or use the live chat on vethome.va.gov.

### Phone numbers

I reviewed the description for 6 different VA phone lines:

- **MyVA411 main information line** is for Veterans and their support networks to contact VA using a 'main, toll-free number.' It will connect to a specific department or office or a VA cal center agent.
- **VA benefits hotline** can help with finding out the status of a claim or appeal, updating your direct deposit information, requesting a letter, reporting a death or getting answers to other questions about VA benefits.
- **VA health benefits hotline** can help with enrolling in VA health care under TERA, paying a bill, asking about Community Care billing, enrolling in CHAMPVA or getting answers to other questions about VA health  care benefits.
- **GI Bill hotline** is for finding out how to verify your enrollment, updating your direct deposit information, checking payment information, or getting answers to other questions about VA education benefits and claims.
- **National Call Center for Homeless Veterans** is for 'Homeless Veterans to talk privately with a trained VA representative for free.' They connect people with programs, services and community resources and provide support.
- **My HealtheVet help desk** is for 'technical support for managing your health care online with My HealtheVet.'
