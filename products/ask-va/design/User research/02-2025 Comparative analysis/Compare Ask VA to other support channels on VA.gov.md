## Purpose

### Research goals

TBC
TBC

- Review how other websites provide help before asking someone to submit an inquiry
- Review how many fields are included on other websites' contact forms
- Review how other websites ask for information that lets them categorize or route an inquiry
- Review how being signed in (or not) changes the experience of contacting another organization online

### Outcome

TBC

This will help us articulate the things we like or donâ€™t like and which direction to go with Ask VA. It will feed into product vision exercises we plan to do with partners.

### Methodology

TBC

1. Identify websites to compare.
2. Review the contact experience on the website.
3. Compare to Ask VA.

## Analysis

I reviewed the following contact experiences:

- My HealtheVet Secure Messaging (MHV SM)
- TBC
- TBC

I reviewed each channel and took notes in [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1738276336649/31f5cc8b2eb56f67173d0318e5e38bda887b53bd). (Note: You may not have access to this Mural board.) After reviewing each website, I re-imagined Ask VA as if it worked like ___ contact experience.
