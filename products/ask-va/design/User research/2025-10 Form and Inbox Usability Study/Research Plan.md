# Form \+ Inbox Research Plan 

**Ask VA, Form \+ Inbox Usability Testing**

**Date**: October, 14, 2025

**Contacts**: Elena B. Naids, Danielle Oppendike

# Background

Ask VA is comprised of a contact form and inbox where Veterans, family members, and other submitters can get answers to any VA question and submit documentation. Ask VA is available to both authenticated and unauthenticated users. The frontend integrates with a backend customer relationship management (CRM) application that routes questions to the appropriate VA team. Multiple VA teams can access and use the CRM.

In May 2025 the product was moved onto the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) platform. With this update, several aspects of the product changed. Feedback since the launch leads us to believe that these changes are causing some significant challenges for our users that require a holistic evaluation.

[Product Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Product%20outline.md)

## âœ… OCTO-DE Priorities

`Objective 1: VAâ€™s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`

`Objective 2: OCTOâ€™s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

## âœ… Veteran Journey

* `Joining`  
* `Serving`  
* `Getting Out`  
* `Starting Up`  
* `Taking Care of Myself`  
* `Reinventing Myself`  
* `Putting Down Roots`  
* `Retiring`  
* `Aging`  
* `Dying`

## âœ… Research Goals

### Goals

`1.` Understand different submittersâ€™ needs from the Ask VA form and inbox. 

`2.` Identify opportunities to simplify the form and inbox and better meet submitter needs. 

`3.` Benchmark submittersâ€™ satisfaction and ease of use with the current Ask VA experience for continuous measurement and improvement.

### Outcome

---

This research will create a benchmark both quantitatively and qualitatively. Providing a baseline satisfaction and ease of use metric that we can strive to improve on over time. It will also be the evidence-based foundation our team needs to effectively make design decisions that will enhance the Ask VA form and inbox experiences. 

---

### Research questions

**`1.` What are submittersâ€™ expectations with the UI, the process, and the service when using Ask VA?**  

**`2.`What are the biggest problem areas in the form for Veteran submitters? For other types of submitters?** 

**`3.`What are the biggest problem areas on the inbox for Veteran submitters? For other types of submitters?** 

**`4.`How would submitters rate their experience with Ask VA?** 

### Hypotheses

---

Veteran submitters (and their families) expect a simple contact form allowing them to ask any question. 

Veteran submitters (and their families) donâ€™t understand the internal routing processes to get their question to the right person.  

The Ask VA form and inbox donâ€™t fit other submitter typesâ€™ processes and mental models very well.

## âœ… Methodology

**Research method:** Usability testing  
**Moderation style:** Moderated \- facilitator led  
**Location:** Remote over Zoom  
**Timeframe:** 60 minute?

## âœ… Research materials

**For moderated usability tests:**

- [Conversation guide](..)

## ðŸš§ Recruitment

[Recruitment checker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v2dqO3mydkqyJ4sGxRHluZIRj9Nnt3BBVWk1-PurgRY/edit?gid=1184124663#gid=1184124663)

### Recruitment approach

Veterans 

- Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**  
    
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question. Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? \[answer should be yes to qualify.\]  
    
- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.  
    
- Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.  
    
- Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:

\[\!NOTE\] Your total number should equal **1.5x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 10 ideal completed sessions, request 15 total participants)*

- `Veterans:` **\[n\]**  
- `School officials/work study supervisors:` **4**  
- `Total:` **\[n\]**  
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **12**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)

*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?*

- `[Place primary criteria here between hash marks when in edit mode]`  
- `primary criteria`  
- `primary criteria`

## ðŸš§ Timeline
