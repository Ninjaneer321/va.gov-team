## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Compare whether it’s more effective to describe percentage complete or not describe progress at all
* Review whether submitters understand when to sign in or not
* Review whether submitters are clear on when to use Ask VA and how to start

## Research questions

Compare whether it’s more effective to describe percentage complete or not describe progress at all:
* Do submitters notice the progress indicator?
* Is this progress indicator effective in describing how far along you are and how much is left?
* Do submitters notice when there's no progress indicator?
* In both scenarios, are submitters missing information (sections, chapters, etc.) to orient them?

Review whether submitters understand when to sign in or not:
* Is it clear when you need to sign in and why?
* If submitters decide not to sign in, why?
* If submitters are interrupted to sign in, do they understand why and what to do?
* Is it clear why information is pre-filled in the form?

Review whether submitters are clear on when to use Ask VA and how to start:
* Can submitters successfully start a new question from the authenticated dashboard?
* Do submitters understand not to use Ask VA in an emergency?
* Do submitters understand what to do in an emergency (instead of using Ask VA)?
* Do submitters notice any overlap between Ask VA and other VA tools?

## Methodology 

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity. We will present a scenario where the submitter has a question about their **education benefits**.

In half of the sessions, participants will use a prototype that includes a **new** progress indicator. In the other half, participants will use a prototype that **does not include** any progress indicator. We will compare both approaches.

We will let submitters **choose whether to sign in or not without guidance**. If they don't choose to sign in up front, they'll be prompted by a modal or alert to sign in after they choose their category and topic. In this scenario, they will need to sign in to continue. We will pre-fill certain parts of the form with mock data.

These are the main components and/or pages, we're testing:
- Progress bar
- Homepage (Unauthenticated)
- Dashboard without cards
- Sign in interruption

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Participants won't notice or point out the progress indicator without prompting.|Definitely False|Many participants noticed and pointed out the progress bar from the first page in the form, without prompting.|
|Participants won't notice or point out the lack of a progress indicator without prompting.|Likely False|2 of 3 participants who didn't see the progress indicator mentioned that something showing your progress would have helped.|
|Percentage will be enough information to motivate participants that they're making progress.|Likely True|At the beginning, percentage was daunting but later on, it was motivating. It helped people, at least, know they were progressing.|
|Participants will be able to start a new question from the authenticated dashboard without issue.|Definitely True|All participants were able to start a new question from the dashboard.|
|Participants will understand not to use Ask VA in emergencies.|Definitely True|Many participants noticed and appreciated content about emergencies. It's clear Ask VA is for non-urgent questions.|
|If participants don't understand that they need to sign in at first, it will be clear once they're prompted to sign in.|Definitely True|Even though some participants chose not to sign in at first, they could tell the VA may ask them to. They weren't surprised by the modal.|

## Key findings

1. It's not clear what you can ask about and how to start asking, until after you sign in.
2. People are motivated to sign in for a more personalized response, not necessarily because it's more secure.
3. Although the percentage is daunting at first, it's later motivating and helps you know when you're done.
4. School information fields are interpreted inconsistently without more details.
5. It's clear why information is pre-filled, but there's uncertainty about what's impacted if you edit pre-fill.
6. Most people notice their progress being saved and expect to find their unfinished question in their dashboard.

## Additional insights

- Overall, the process was simple enough that people consistently get themselves through each question.
- People could find the category and topic in this scenario, despite mention of the number of options to choose from.
- 'I'm the Veteran' is a very clear choice, but it may not be the case if you're also in a business role.
- 'Reason you contacted us' is consistently redundant, confusing and unrelated.
- People want to review their question on the review page, not just their personal information.
- It's expected that the form start at 0% and end at 100% upon submission.
- The difference between My HealtheVet Secure Messaging and Ask VA is more clear after you finish.
- Being able to ask about all different subjects in one place, may be Ask VA's unique selling point.
- When people aren't sure what to expect from Ask VA, they hope for a way to ask their question in free-text and receive an immediate response. They describe tools similar to chatbots, or "interactive FAQ's."
- One person's experience was shaped by their feeling that VA websites  come off unfriendly and monotone.
