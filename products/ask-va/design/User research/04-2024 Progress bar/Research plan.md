## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when they’re separating up until aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Compare whether it’s more effective to describe percentage complete or not describe progress at all
* Review whether submitters are clear on when to use Ask VA and how to start
* Review whether submitters understand when to sign in or not

### Outcome

This research will help us determine if and how we need to improve the design and content of Ask VA. It will also inform our research objectives for the next round of research.

### Research questions

Compare whether it’s more effective to describe percentage complete or not describe progress at all
* Do submitters notice the progress bar? Alternatively, do they notice when it's missing?
* Is the new progress bar effective and necessary?

Review whether submitters are clear on when to use Ask VA and how to start
* Can submitters successfully start a new question from the authenticated dashboard?
* Do submitters understand not to use Ask VA in emergencies?

Review whether submitters understand when to sign in or not
* Is it clear when you need to sign in and why?
* If submitters are interrupted to sign in, do they understand why and what to do?

### Hypotheses

[Need to write].

## Methodology

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use a Figma prototype with limited interactivity.

We will test the following steps:
* Unauthenticated home page
* (Option to) Sign in
* Start a question from your dashboard
* Category and topic
* (If they didn't already) Please sign in alert
* Who is your question about
* Your relationship to the Veteran
* School information (personal)
* Your question
* Tell us about yourself
* Your contact information
* Reason you contacted us
* Review and submit
* Confirmation page

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We will work with Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research.
