## Background

Ask VA (AVA) lets Veterans, their family members and other submitters ask VA a question. In 2024, VA received over 500,000 questions through Ask VA. Ask VA includes a form, where submitters share their question with VA, and, a dashboard, where submitters review past questions, read replies from VA and reply back.

After launching on VA.gov, we will focus on making quick, responsive improvements to the product while also bringing partners along on the journey. Our [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Product%20outline.md) includes more details about Ask VA and [Phase 2 initiatives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Phase%202%3A%20Initiatives.md) describes our focus from January to March 2025.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when theyâ€™re separating through aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are:

* understand how submitters expect to interact with and benefit from automation when sending a question to VA
* understand which automation features make it easier, faster or more accurate for Veterans to send a question to VA

### Outcome

This research will help us determine how we should use automation to support the submitter experience of Ask VA. 

We will develop a clear recommendation for which feature(s) to carry forward and prioritize building.

### Research questions

Please note: I will add additional, specific research questions, once we finalize which 3 concepts we will test.

Understand how submitters expect to interact with and benefit from automation when sending a question to VA:
* Do submitters recognize when something is automated? How does this change their experience?
* What are submitters key hopes and fears when it comes to automation?
* Which part of the process of submitting a question could benefit the most from automation?
* Are there other ways, besides these concepts, that submitters expect Ask VA to be automated?

Understand which automation features make it easier, faster or more accurate for Veterans to send a question to VA:
* How does this concept make it easier or more difficult for Veterans to send their question to VA?
* How does this concept make it faster or slower for Veterans to send their question to VA?
* How does this concept make Veterans likely to send a more or less accurate question to VA?
* Which issues do we foresee with implementing this concept based on submitter's experiences during testing?

### Hypotheses

Please note: I will add hypotheses, once we finalize which 3 concepts we will test.

1. TBD
2. TBD
3. TBD

## Methodology

This will be a moderated study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity and test on mobile only.

We will present 3 concepts (in varying orders) to submitters who will use and react to them:

Please note: I will update this, once we finalize which 3 concepts we will test.

1. **Recommend a topic based on a category and question:** Submitter chooses a category and inputs a question, system recommends a topic to the submitter, submitter edits their topic or continues with recommendation.
2. **Ask for a more detailed question to determine category and topic:** Submitter inputs a question, system alerts them to add more information so it can figure out where to send their question, system recommends a category and topic, submitter can edit their question or continue with recommendation.
3. **Question helps narrow down the list of categories:** Submitter inputs a question, system uses question to narrow down the list of categories, submitter chooses a category, submitter chooses a topic.
4. **Provide helpful links before someone decides whether to continue asking a question:** Submitter inputs a question, system uses question to provide helpful links to other information on VA.gov that may answer their question, submitter can choose to navigate away from asking a question or to continue by selecting their category.
