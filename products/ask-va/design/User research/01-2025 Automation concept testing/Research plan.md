## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when they’re separating through aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* TBD
* TBD

### Outcome

This research will help us determine if and how we may use automation to support the submitter experience of Ask VA.

### Research questions

TBD
* TBD
* TBD

### Hypotheses

1. TBD
2. TBD

## Methodology

This will be a moderated study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity.

We will present 3 concepts (in varying orders) to submitters who will use and react to them. 

The 3 concepts are:

1. TBD
2. TBD
3. TBD

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will work with Perigean to recruit Veterans.

### Recruitment criteria

We will recruit 8 Veterans for a total of 5-6 completed sessions.

For more details about our criteria, refer to our [Recruitment ticket](add link).

|# of participants|Criteria|
|:--|:--|
|Exactly 8|Are Veterans|
|Exactly 8|Have contacted VA online or over the phone in the past year|
|Exactly 8|Have signed in to VA.gov in the past year|
|Exactly 4|Are willing to join from a mobile device|
|Exactly 4|Are willing to join from a desktop device|
|At least 4|Have a cognitive disability or consideration|
|At least 4|Are over 55 years old|
|At least 2|Identify Asian or Hispanic*|
|At least 2|Identify as Black or Native|
|At least 2|Are rural|
|At least 2|Don't have a degree|
|At least 1|Identify as a gender other than male|
|At least 1|Identify as LGBTQ+|

*We're aiming to fill gaps in our previous studies. We've specifically called out Asian or Hispanic demographics because we haven't been able to recruit participants from these demographics in our last two studies. We want to ensure we recruit these underserved Veterans.

### Screener questions

1. Have you contacted the VA online or over the phone in the past year? [Yes, no: Must answer Yes to qualify]
2. Have you used Ask VA before? Share link to [Ask VA](https://ask.va.gov/). [Yes, no: Their answer won't have any impact on whether they qualify]
3. Have you signed in to VA.gov in the past year? [Yes, no: Must answer Yes to qualify]
4. Are you able to join the Zoom session from a smartphone such as a Samsung Galaxy or iPhone? Any kind of smartphone will work as long as it connects to the internet. [Yes, no: Exactly half of participants must answer Yes to qualify]
5. Are you able to join the Zoom session from a desktop or laptop computer? Any kind of desktop or laptop will work as long as it connects to the internet.  [Yes, no: Exactly half of participants must answer Yes to qualify]
6. Do you find it difficult to remember or learn new things, focus on a task, or make decisions? We ask this question because we want to make sure that our tools work for people who live with challenges like these.  [Yes, no: At least half of participants must answer Yes to qualify]

## Pilot sessions

Perigean does **not** need to set up our pilot sessions. Tyler will schedule and add participants herself.

### Pilot

- Pilot participant: TBD
- Date and time of pilot session: TBD

## Research sessions

- Length of sessions: 1 hour
- Buffer between sessions: 30 minutes
- Maximum sessions per day: 4 sessions

### Availability

We will provide 16 time slots, with the aim to book 8 sessions.

If possible, we'd like to prioritize filling earlier sessions in the schedule, first.

These time slots are for Perigean. We will schedule sessions with business submitters ourselves, separately.

**We’d also like to request that Perigean calls each participant to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them. Please include the session time in each participant's respective time zone (from their address).**

|Date|Timeslots (EST)|
|:--|:--|
|Monday, X|9-10am, 10:30am-11:30am, 2-3pm, 3:30-4:30pm|
