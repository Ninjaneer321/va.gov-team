## Background

Ask VA (AVA) lets Veterans, their family members and other submitters ask VA a question. In 2024, VA received over 500,000 questions through Ask VA. Ask VA includes a form, where submitters share their question with VA, and, a dashboard, where submitters review past questions, read replies from VA and reply back.

After launching on VA.gov, we will focus on making quick, responsive improvements to the product while also bringing partners along on the journey. Our [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Product%20outline.md) includes more details about Ask VA and [Phase 2 initiatives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Phase%202%3A%20Initiatives.md) describes our focus from January to March 2025.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when theyâ€™re separating through aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are:

* understand how submitters expect to interact with and benefit from automation when sending a question to VA
* understand whether certain automation features make it easier, faster or more intuitive for Veterans to send a question through Ask VA

### Outcome

This research will help us determine how we should use automation to support the submitter experience of Ask VA. 

We will develop a clear recommendation for which feature(s) to carry forward and prioritize building.

### Research questions

Understand how submitters expect to interact with and benefit from automation when sending a question to VA:
* Do submitters recognize when something is automated? How does this change their experience?
* What are submitters key hopes and fears when it comes to automation?
* Which part of the process of submitting a question could benefit the most from automation?
* Are there other ways, besides these concepts, that submitters expect Ask VA to be automated?

Understand whether certain automation features make it easier, faster or more intuitive for Veterans to send a question through Ask VA
* How does this concept make it easier or more difficult for Veterans to ask their question?
* How does this concept make it faster or slower for Veterans to ask their question?
* How does this concept make it more or less intuitive for Veterans to ask their question?
* Which issues do we foresee with implementing this concept based on submitter's experiences?

### Hypotheses

1. TBD
2. TBD
3. TBD

## Methodology

This will be a moderated study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity.

We will present 3 concepts (in varying orders) to submitters who will use and react to them. 

The 3 concepts are:

1. TBD
2. TBD
3. TBD

### Research materials
