# About this research

## Study
[2025-01 Ask VA: Automation concept testing #TBD](add link)

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) lets Veterans, their family members and other submitters ask VA a question. In 2024, VA received over 500,000 questions through Ask VA. Ask VA includes a form, where submitters share their question with VA, and a dashboard, where submitters review past questions, read replies from VA and reply back.

After launching on VA.gov, we will focus on making quick, responsive improvements to the product while also bringing partners along on the journey. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Product%20outline.md) includes more details.
