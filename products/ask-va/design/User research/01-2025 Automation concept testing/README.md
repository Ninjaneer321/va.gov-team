# About this research

## Study
[2025-01 Ask VA: Automation concept testing #TBD](add link)

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) lets Veterans, their family members and other submitters ask VA a question. Last year, VA received over 400,000 questions through Ask VA. Ask VA includes a form, where submitters share their question with VA, and, a dashboard, where submitters review past questions, read replies from VA and reply back.

Weâ€™re currently moving Ask VA to VA.gov. It needs to be mobile friendly, accessible and simpler to ask a question. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/product/Product%20outline.md) includes more details.
