## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when they’re separating up until aging.

## Research goals

The key goal of this study is to:

* Identify any barriers that could prevent Veterans who use screen readers or magnification from asking a question through Ask VA

### Outcome

This research will help us document and prioritize any bugs or usability issues before we launch on VA.gov.

### Research questions

* Are any headers, labels or links lacking description or clarity?
* Can Veterans interact with all elements using only their keyboards?
* Are Veterans still oriented and able to use the form when magnified?
* Is it clear that information is pre-filled? Is it clear how to update pre-filled information?
* Can Veterans understand their progress through the form without visual cues?
* Should the progress bar heading be the first element in focus within the form?
* Are there any inconsistencies during the journey that present confusion?
* Do Veterans who use screen readers or magnification feel they can ask a question without the support of another person?
* Does Ask VA need to change or evolve to offer an equitable experience? If so, how?

### Hypotheses

1. Veterans will find headers, labels and links are descriptive and clear.
2. Veterans will be able to interact with all elements using only their keyboards.
3. Veterans will be oriented and still able to use the form when magnified.
4. Veterans using a screen reader or magnification will understand that information has been pre-filled from 'their' account and know how to update it.
5. Veterans will understand their progress in the form with or without visual cues.
6. Sign in will be a barrier for some Veterans using a screen reader or magnification.

## Methodology

We will run a moderated usability study remotely on Zoom. We will test in staging using test user accounts.

After each user, we will reset test user account passwords following [this guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/76960).

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We will work with Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research.

We request that Perigean:
- shares a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey for this study, so we can review it before it goes out to participants
- emails each participant after they've been recruited (copy content provided)
- calls each participant to remind them about the session, one day in advance.

#### Email to send each participant after recruitment, prior to their session

```
Thank you for participating in our upcoming study. Before we meet we’d like you to answer a few questions please.

How would you prefer to receive a link to the prototype during the session? By email, text or through Zoom?

On the call, we’ll have an accessibility specialist with us. Are there any other accommodations that would be helpful during your session?

We look forward to meeting with you soon.
```
