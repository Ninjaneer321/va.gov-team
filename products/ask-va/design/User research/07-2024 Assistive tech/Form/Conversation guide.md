## Intro (5 minutes)

> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`.

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tyler]. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact VA online if they have a question.

**What I hope to do today** is get a sense of how we can make this process better.

**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration that you've had with contacting VA in the past. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustration in case there's things we can improve in the future.

Before we get started, I just want to confirm a few things.

- Do you use a `SCREEN READER` `ALTERNATIVE NAVIGATION TOOL` `SCREEN MAGNIFIER` to access websites or applications?
- Which tool are you going to be using today?

> If they're not using assistive tech, politely end the session.

Okay great. Moving along, we have a few people who are here to observe this session. One person is an accessibility specialist, who will support you and I during this conversation. And my other teammates would like to join to listen in, learn and take notes.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to observe?**

- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. This is `PARTICIPANT`.

Let's go around and say hello, starting with `ACCESSIBILITY SPECIALIST'S NAME`, our accessibility specialist.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session could take up to an hour and a half.** I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure the description is clear.
- **I’m going to share a prototype with you today.** This is like a test version of VA.gov. I'm going to have you sign in to a test account. This means, that we'll be using pretend information today. So the prototype won't have any of your actual data, like your name or Social security number.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- Last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm up (5 minutes)

It seems like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with the VA and our online services.

- I'm curious, how long have you been a Veteran?
- Have you ever contacted the VA online or over the phone?
  - `IF NO`
    - Why might you contact the VA?
    - If you were going to contact the VA, would you prefer to call, go online or get in touch another way?
  - `IF YES`
    - Can you tell me about a time when you contacted the VA?
    - How do you usually contact the VA? Why?
    - How was the support you received?
- Have you ever heard of Ask VA?

Okay, great. Thanks for sharing that with me. It's helpful to know a little bit about how you've contacted the VA in past.

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- Why do they choose to contact VA (instead of going elsewhere or doing another task)?
- How do they decide which channel to use when they contact the VA?
- Are they familiar with Ask VA?

</details>

## Set up (10 minutes)

Next, we're going to set up the prototype I mentioned.

- Are you on your desktop or mobile device?

Okay, great. I'm going to send you a link to the test website. I'm also going to share a username and password with you.

- [If we don't already know what they prefer] Would you prefer that I email you the link, text, or send it in the chat on Zoom?

> Send link to staging, username and password.

I'm going to give you a couple minutes to open your `email, text or Zoom chat`. 

- Can you let me know once you've opened the link to the test website?

> Participant confirms link is open.

Great. Next, I'd like you to share your screen on Zoom.

- Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?
  - `IF YES` Great. Can you please share your screen?
  - `IF NO` I’ll walk you through how to do that…

> Screen sharing starts.

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen with the test website.
