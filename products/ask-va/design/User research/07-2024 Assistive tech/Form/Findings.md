## Research goals

The key goal of this study is to:

* Identify any barriers that could prevent Veterans who use assistive technology from asking a question through Ask VA

## Research questions

* Are any headers, labels or links lacking description or clarity?
* Can Veterans interact with all elements using only their keyboards?
* Are click targets, hover states and labels of controls always available and clear?
* Are Veterans still oriented and able to use the form when magnified?
* Is it clear that information is pre-filled? Is it clear how to update pre-filled information?
* Can Veterans understand their progress through the form without visual cues?
* Should the progress bar heading be the first element in focus within the form?
* Are there any inconsistencies during the journey that present confusion?
* Do Veterans who use assistive technology feel they can ask a question without the support of another person?
* Does Ask VA need to change or evolve to offer an equitable experience? If so, how?

## Methodology 

We will run a moderated usability study remotely on Zoom. We will mock the sign in process, so participants don't have to sign in but we can test the authenticated experience.

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Veterans will think headers, labels and links are descriptive and clear.|Mostly True|Most headers, labels and links were descriptive and clear. But, there was some confusion between next and continue, to provide one example.|
|Veterans will be able to interact with all elements using only their keyboards or other devices.|True|Veterans were able to interact with all elements using their assistive technology.|
|Veterans will be oriented and still able to use the form when magnified.|Mostly True|Mostly, Veterans did not face any issues due to magnification. However, one person clicked continue instead of search due to magnification.|
|Veterans will understand that information has been pre-filled from 'their' account and know how to update it.|Sometimes True|Veterans were slightly confused by prefilled contact information, but this is also due to testing with mock data. We also didn't include a prefill alert, letting them know the information has been filled in already. People were sometimes not sure whether a field was filled already or not.|
|Veterans will understand their progress in the form with or without visual cues.|Mostly True|The visual aspect of the progress bar didn't provide any more description as to where you are in the form, so screen reader users had a very similar experience with the progress bar. There were mixed feelins on whether it was necessary but it didn't deter or confuse nearly anyone.|
|Sign in will be a barrier for some Veterans using a screen reader or magnification.|Not Enough Information|We mocked sign in for testing.|

## Key findings

1. Most Veterans can easily complete the form without help, but struggle to imagine using Ask VA over another tool.
2. The progress bar can be useful as a consistent anchor on each page.
3. People seek a specific category and topic, and they would find it easier to choose from shorter lists.
4. Some people click continue instead of search or next (page of results) instead of continue.
5. Veterans consistently misinterpret the military postal code checkbox and the additional info doesn't help clarify.
6. It's not always clear to screen reader users when information is prefilled in the form.
7. The review and submit page is repetitive, particularly for screen reader users.

## Additional insights

- There's a known bug where updates on the review page are triggering success messages on multiple, unrelated fields.
- Error messages are triggering early on radio buttons when using keyboard navigation.
- Focus behavior for groups should be consistent, and it should be clear when something is a group of radio buttons or checkboxes.
- It may not be clear to people that when they want to read the reply, they should sign back into VA.gov.

We are currently writing recommendations.

## Underserved groups we haven’t talked to 

We have completed the [VA Recruitment Checker for marginalized Veteran groups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit#gid=1221033726).

We only had 1 no show so we exceeded our target of 6 participants. We aimed to fill gaps in our previous studies. So, we specifically called out Asian or Hispanic demographics when we recruited, because we haven't been able to recruit participants from these demographics in our last two studies. Still, we did not recruit any Asian participants. Also, this study did not recruit for other than honorable, immigrant origin, expat or AT users.
