## Research goals

The key goal of this study is to:

* Identify any barriers that could prevent Veterans who use assistive technology from reviewing past questions, reading a reply from VA or replying to VA through Ask VA

## Research questions

* Are any headers, labels or links lacking description or clarity?
* Can Veterans interact with all elements using only their keyboards?
* Are click targets, hover states and labels of controls always available and clear?
* Are Veterans still oriented and able to use the dashboard when magnified?
* Are there any inconsistencies during the journey that present confusion?
* Do Veterans who use assistive technology feel they can read a reply from VA or reply to VA without the support of another person?
* Does Ask VA need to change or evolve to offer an equitable experience? If so, how?
* Are statuses clear, do they require more description? If so, just for screen reader users or for everyone?
* Do accordions adding unnecessary complexity? Would plain text be better for the conversation?

## Methodology 

We ran a moderated usability study remotely on Zoom. We mocked the sign in process, so participants didn't have to sign in but we did test the authenticated experience.

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Veterans will think headers, labels and links are descriptive and clear.|Mostly True|Most headers, labels and links were descriptive and clear. But, there was confusion understanding which elements sit within a card, what 'Reopened' means, and the conversation accordions could be labelled more clearly.|
|Veterans will be able to interact with all elements using only their keyboards or other devices.|True|Veterans were able to interact with all elements using their assistive technology, apart from one Veteran who navigated visually and expected their mouse to activate VoiceOver upon hover, which did not work.|
|Veterans will be oriented and still able to use the dashboard when magnified.|True|There was very little difference noted with magnification.|
|Veteran's who use screen readers will find it difficult to know how many cards are under the "Your question" section, including when they filter by category and/or status.|True|Veterans did not understand which elements sit within a card, which made it difficult to know how many cards were present when using a screen reader. Whether with filters or not.|
|Veterans will not have difficulty navigating between pages of cards on the dashboard with their assistive technology.|True|There wasn't difficulty with navigating, it was more related to not knowing when a card ends and a new one begins.|
|Veterans will find it difficult to understand what each status means without more description, regardless of which assistive technology they use.|Mostly False|Most statuses were very clear, apart from 'Reopened' which Veterans associate with claims not conversations.|

## Additional insights

- Skimming cards by submission date is simple for sighted users.
- There's an issue with content continuing after the ellipsis in the cards.
- Magnification users felt they would rely on magnification most to read the 'collapse all' or 'expand all' button and the reference number.
- Many people misunderstand the reply from VA or aren't satisfied by it.
- It's straightforward for people to send a reply back to VA using different assistive technology.
- People need reassurance that Ask VA is secure before sharing personal information and/or files online.
- It should be clear if Ask VA is not the best tool or contact method to use.
- Veterans prefer to get in touch with a specific department or person directly, rather than a catch all.
- One person, who navigates visually with a screen reader, expected VoiceOver to work with their cursor but it did not.

## Recommendations

- Grouping the dashboard cards in an LI element will make it easier to distinguish between questions.
- Consider shortening the text on 'check details' so it doesn't take as long to hear 'link.'
- Remove sorting menu and default to always newest to oldest.
- Add description of how many cards are on the dashboard, which changes when filtering.
- Move filter by status to first, and filter by category next.
- Change first, bold text on accordions to sender and second, unbolded text to date and time.
- Default all accordions closed in conversation.
- Add accordion border and consider adding more spacing to message within according.
- When a question is reopened, it goes back to in progress until it changes to replied again.
- Fix bug that anchors you to the footer when you click to next page.
- Fix issue with content continuing after ellipsis in the cards.

## Underserved groups we haven’t talked to 

We have completed the [VA Recruitment Checker for Equality]([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?gid=1967698004#gid=1967698004](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?gid=294039656#gid=294039656)).

This study focused on AT, as do these notes. We had 4 sessions cancelled for various reasons and 2 no-shows. We scheduled 3 additional sessions. This was partly due to lack of clarity about who is included in each cohort on Perigean's part. In the end, we exceeded our target of 6 and finished with 9 complete sessions. More importantly, we hit our cohort quotas, with:
- Screen reader users: 5 of 3* complete sessions
- Alternative navigation users: 3 of 2** complete sessions
- Magnification users: 1 of 1 complete session

*1 person navigated visually with their mouse
**2 people only use Dragon for dictation not for navigation
