## Attendees

## Summary
### Key takeaways
- We don't need to collect birth sex.
- We do need to access gender identity data for reporting. We need to understand how often people are using Ask VA, categorized by different gender identity.
- We don't need gender identity data to properly address people because we have pronouns and preferred name already.
### Other discussion points
- Data accuracy is a VA-wide challenge.
- Birth sex (only) won't fulfill reporting needs.
- We don't want to have siloed data.
- We don't want to add burden to Ask VA staff who answer questions.
- MPI is the authoritative source for sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) traits.
