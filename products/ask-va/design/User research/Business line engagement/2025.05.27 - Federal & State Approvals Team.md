## Appendix

### Unabridged meeting notes

- They do not need submitters to authenticate.
- Most of the inquiries received are relatively homogenous. Majority of their questions are, "Is my program approved at __ school or training facility?"
- They also answer questions about enrollment manager issues.
- They do need to know specifics, like, if they're the beneficiary or if they're asking about a payment.
- They received 88 questions over the weekend, for example, wanting to know if the program is approved at [this] foreign school.
- Questions currently get routed to VA education benefits' regional mailboxes.
- Their work all falls under the umbrella of Education benefits.
- Education benefits doesn't currently have a queue relating to foreign programs or federal facilities.
- If they're asking about a benefit payment or eligibility, it should route elsewhere.
- There is a distinction between federal and foreign, but not down to state or school of residence. We don't need to collect state or school of residence, or school facility, or country.
- We need 1 queue for Federal and State approvals.
- SCOs could ask them about enrollment manager, tuition amounts, 'When can I certify this person?', training programs
- Example of the most common question they receive:
  
  > Good evening,
  >
  > I am writing to see if the following program is approved for use of the Post 9-11 GI Bill:
  >
  > School Name: Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin
  > Address: Kaiserswerther Str. 16-18, 14195 Berlin, Germany
  > Program: North American Studies - Master's Program
- We need to discuss options eg. replies allowed, reply window, attachments allowed, contact options they support
