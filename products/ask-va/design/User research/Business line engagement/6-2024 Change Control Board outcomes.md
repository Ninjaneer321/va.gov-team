# Outcomes from Change Control Board on June 11, 2024

## Background

We presented at the CRM team's Change Control Board meeting on June 11, 2024. The Change Control board is made up of business lines who are stakeholders for Ask VA (AVA).

We presented two fields that we can remove to enhance the submitter experience:
- `Reason you're contacting us`
- `Gender`

The Change Control Board reviews the slides and votes anonymously in their own time.

## Outcomes

The Change Control Board voted to remove both fields:
- `Reason you're contacting us`
- `Gender`
