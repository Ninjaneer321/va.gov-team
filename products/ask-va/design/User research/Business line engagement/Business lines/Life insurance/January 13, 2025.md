# January 13, 2025: Life insurance topic issues

*Ask VA VA.gov Team*

## Attendees

- Ask VA VA.gov: Becky Phung, Tyler Gindraux
- CRM: Chris Clemens, Tamara Kanterman, Shelby Carl
- Life Insurance: Joseph Melvin, Adam Woolf

## Key takeaways

- We lean towards removing these topics and would like to confirm with Jeremy Haas of Web Operations:
   - Signing in to VA life insurance portal (under Sign in)
   - Accessing policy online (under Life insurance)
   - Life insurance website issues (under Life insurance)
- To mitigate issues we're seeing with the "Other" topic, we'd like to review the health insurance topics. Right now, life insurance is the only category and topics that include the word 'insurance' and our assumption is this is why life insurance is getting CHAMPVA related inquiries that are meant for VHA.
- We aren't able to make these changes right now. We will have to release on VA.gov with the current topic lists, but we should look at re-routing once we're live on VA.gov and assess whether this is still an issue. We can action changes on VA.gov.

## Notes

### Topic: Signing in to VA life insurance portal

- Becky: Our suggestion is to route this to VA Web Operations
- Joe: That makes the most sense, because the call center can only do so much with the Veteran. And most of the re-routes are because they aren’t life insurance specific, they just can’t log in to VA.gov. They might not even have a VA Life policy.
- Joe: Exactly where you said it could go, is where it should go. (Eg. Route to VACO VA.gov Web Operations).
- Joe: On occasion, the life insurance team could help with issues with log in to Pay.gov, for example. We do all that. But sometimes it’s not those questions.
- Natalie: We could just remove this topic?
- Tyler: I agree with removal. Web Operations can re-route to Life insurance when necessary.
- Chris: Let’s check with Jeremy Haas about this. If we remove the life insurance topic, they may receive some things related to life insurance.
- Tyler: There are also two topics under life insurance related to sign in. For example, ‘Accessing policy online’ and ‘Insurance website issues.’
- Joe: Most of the time, we need to sit there and tell them for ID.me you need to call, etc. We will give them the Pay.gov link.
- Joe: Don’t have IT support in life insurance. Refer them elsewhere.
- Joe: I’m the policy services rep. Anything dealing with first time, if they have an SDVI policy, if they already have a VA Life policy. I can see what’s going on, what their question is, etc. Most of the time I am taking away access for them, go in and manually send their policy out to them, and then re-grant access. I do that a couple times a week.
- Joe: Our new life insurance policy is for people who did not apply the first time. [Etc.]
- Joe: We do Pay.gov, but we have our own portal that we help with too.
- Tyler: Do people ask questions about pay.gov and/or your life insurance portal using these topics? Or do they submit a question under the topic that their policy is related to?
- Joe: You're right, they most often use VA Life right now. Not the IT topics.
- Becky: Our options are to route to Web Operations. Or to remove this topic. This is what we lean towards. We should confirm with Jeremy Haas.

### Topic: Other

- Joe: We get things for CHAMPVA and VHA. Not just life.
- Joe: We talked about this with CHAMPVA last month, I didn’t even know it went through VHA. We never looked at it being related to VHA.
- Joe: I handle most ‘Other.’
- Joe: Sometimes I will give 222 VETS to start with VHA for these questions, rather than re-routing.
- Becky: One thing we can do is add a topic that will route to VHA HAC CHAMPVA. People could incorrectly select this.
- Tyler/Becky: We can monitor whether or how re-routing is impacted when we go live on VA.gov.
- Tyler: We can review health care topics to see where “insurance” could help.
- Chris: There’s no mention of insurance anywhere else except as “life insurance.” They might not even know the acronym for the program, but they know it’s insurance.
- Tyler: We could think about borrowing some language from this VA.gov content page, when we review health care topics: https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/va-health-care-and-other-insurance/
- Joe: We’re the only one that includes the word insurance. And I guess that’s why we’re getting those questions, even though we know that one is VHA. We even get questions about auto and everything else
