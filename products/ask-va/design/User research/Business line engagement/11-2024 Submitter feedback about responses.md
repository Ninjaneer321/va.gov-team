# Submitter feedback about responses

Last updated by @tygindraux on November 1, 2024

## Background

We regularly do user research with submitters to understand their experiences using Ask VA. During research, we've received feedback about what submitters expect from VA's responses through Ask VA. The purpose of this document is to share this feedback with Ask VA business lines.

In these research studies, we used actual responses that have been sent to submitters through Ask VA in the past. The responses were anonymized and any minor changes we made maintained the integrity of the original response. Rather than sharing the specific responses we tested, we've generalized this feedback so it can be useful to all business lines.

## Feedback

1. Veterans anticipate that inquiries marked as solved by VA will not actually feel solved for submitters. Even before they read a reply from VA, Veterans expect to be frustrated.

2. Veterans always need a next step. Even if they've asked about a benefit or service that they're ineligible for, they expect to receive information or advice about other options.

> "[It's typical] VA, like, no, you don't qualify for that, and that's the end of it. They say it's solved and, well, I still have my issue. What else? What other things are available? What other resources are available to me?"

> "This is for family members of service members. Veterans, kind of, blah blah blah. Okay. So in other words, no, you don't get nothing."

3. Veterans are likely to misunderstand the meaning of VA's response. If anything is left to interpretation, they risk understanding it incorrectly or getting confused.

4. Veterans are frustrated by responses that seem "obviously copy and pasted" or canned. If responses are not specific and personal, people prefer to use instant, automated tools. This includes business submitters, who often turn to Ask VA for more complex questions, expecting more specific answers.

> "This was a canned answer and I'm [frustrated with] him, her, they or the computer that generated it."

5. Veterans are generally unfamiliar with terminology and jargon internal to VA. This applies to acronyms and department names or structures.

> "It's telling you what alphabet suit group is responding."
