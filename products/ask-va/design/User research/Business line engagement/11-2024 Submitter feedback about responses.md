# Submitter feedback about responses

Last updated by @tygindraux on November 1, 2024

## Background

We regularly do user research with submitters to understand their experiences using Ask VA. We've received feedback about what submitters expect from VA's responses through Ask VA. The purpose of this document is to share this with Ask VA business lines.

In these research studies, we used actual responses that have been sent to submitters through Ask VA in the past. The responses were anonymized and any minor changes we made maintained the integrity of the original response.

## Feedback

Finding 5: There's an expectation that inquiries marked as solved by VA will not actually feel solved for Veterans.
Labels: PRDT: AVA, AUD: Veterans, DSC: Card

People understand that 'Solved' means there's a reply from VA.

But, Veterans have low expectations something marked as 'Solved' will actually feel solved to them. Even before they read the reply, they anticipate frustration.

Fittingly, VA's reply was often misunderstood, 'too long' or 'obviously copy and pasted.'

If responses are not specific and personal, people prefer to use instant, automated tools. This includes business submitters, who turn to Ask VA for more complex questions, expecting more specific answers.

"I'm assuming the 'Solved' [means] your issue was resolved, or whatever question you had was answered."

"[It's typical] VA, like, no, you don't qualify for that, and that's the end of it. They say it's solved and, well, I still have my issue. What else? What other things are available? What other resources are available to me?"

"It's telling you what alphabet suit group is responding. That this is for family members of service members. Veterans kind of blah blah blah. Okay. So in other words, no, you don't get nothing."

"The status that says 'Solved.' Does that mean that they've provided me an answer to the question I asked or that whatever I'm mailing to them has been solved?"
