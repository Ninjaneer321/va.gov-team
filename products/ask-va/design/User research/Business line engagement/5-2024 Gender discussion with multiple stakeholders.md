# May 1, 2024:  Gender discussion with multiple stakeholders  
_Ask VA VA.gov Team_

## Summary
- Recommendation from the Ask VA VA.gov team: Removing the gender question from the AVA form. However, we get birth sex (not gender identity) data from MPI currently. 
- Top concerns:
   - Misgendering: If we only get birth sex and not gender identity, there's a greater risk Ask VA agents misgender submitters. Some ideas to alleviate this include using gender neutral honorifics like Veteran [Name], getting gender identity data from MPI, 
   - Updating gender identity: There's an option to update gender identity in the profile on VA.gov right now.
   - Collecting gender identity: Should Ask VA be used to collect gender identity information if the profile on VA.gov already does this?
   - Using gender identity: The CWV needs this data to understand the populations by gender that they help through Ask VA. We shouldn't collect data we don't use.
