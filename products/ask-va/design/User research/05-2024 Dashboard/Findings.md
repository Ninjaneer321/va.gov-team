## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Understand how submitters find a question in their dashboard
* Understand what submitters need to learn when they review their question's details

## Research questions

Understand how submitters find a question in their dashboard:
* Which labels or details are useful in identifying a specific question? For example, category, reference number, or date.
* Do people expect to be able to 'search' their dashboard?
* Can people find the question they're looking for?
* How does this differ if you have a few or a lot of questions in your dashboard? And/or, if you're a business submitter?
* Do the statuses and icons make sense in this context?
* Can people find the link to review the details of their inquiry?
* What do people expect to happen when they click 'Check details'?

Understand what submitters need to learn when they review their question's details:
* Can submitters successfully navigate to their question details?
* What do people notice first when they review their question details?
* Which labels or details are useful when people check their question details?
* Do people scroll down to check the reply from VA, and can they find it?
* Do submitters understand how or if they can reply back to VA?
* If they can't reply to VA, what would submitters do if they have an issue or follow-up question?

## Methodology 

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity.

We will present a scenario where the submitter has already asked VA a question and is ready to check if they have a reply.

These are the main features we're testing:
- Find a question in your dashboard (Authenticated)
- Review question's details (Authenticated)

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|People will generally understand the content within the cards without labels, like, 'Date submitted.'|Definitely True||
|People may confuse the date submitted (H3, primary date) with the date last updated (secondary date) especially with date sorting.|Somewhat True||
|Certain statuses and icons will be difficult to understand without more description.|Likely False||
|It will be hard to identify which questions have a reply from VA.|Definitely False||
|People will expect to be able to search in their dashboard using keywords in the question or category.|Definitely True||
|People may only use the sorting feature when they have many cards.|Definitely True||
|It will be straightforward to find the link to check details, but some people will think they can click on the entire card or that it will open additional details on the same page.|Likely False||
|On the details page, people will scroll past details to look for a reply from VA.|Definitely True||
|The sequence of the page will feel unintuitive, with people scrolling around to read VA's reply, their question and their reply to VA.|Definitely True||
|People who can't respond to VA will call or submit a new question if they have a follow up question or issue.|Likely True||

## Key findings

1. People use last updated date and status to find items that have a reply or should have a reply soon.
2. Question and category provide keywords that help people skim and identify particular items.
3. Education business submitters organize their inquiries by student name.
4. It can be confusing deciphering between new and in progress, but reopened and solved are well understood.
5. There's an expectation that inquiries marked as solved by VA will not actually feel solved for Veterans.
6. It's more intuitive to read and save a conversation that's in chronological order.

## Details of findings 

### Finding 1: People use last updated date and status to find items that have a reply or should have a reply soon.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

Tracking dates is important because people expect delays from VA and, for business submitters, need to ensure compliance.

However, multiple similar dates can be confusing.

People primarily focus on 'last updated' date and status to determine if a question has been answered or when to expect a reply.

### Finding 2: Question and category provide keywords that help people skim and identify particular items.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

People would prefer to search for items using category labels or keywords.

Also, skimming questions written verbatim helps in identifying items.

This is particularly useful when someone is trying to recall a past question. For example, to re-read the response from VA or to check whether they've already asked before they submit a new question.

### Finding 3: Education business submitters organize their inquiries by student name.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

Education business users use student names to match Ask VA questions to their paper or digital case folder.

Some business submitters use the reference number to distinguish between and recall items. Most people, however, don't use the reference number much. It may only become useful if they need to call VA to follow up.

### Finding 4: It can be confusing deciphering between new and in progress, but reopened and solved are well understood.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

Veterans use the claims process to understand Ask VA statuses. This mental model is reference often and helps people know what to expect.

'In progress' is generally understood as, "they're working on it."

But, 'New' is hard to distinguish from 'In progress.' In some cases, people think 'New' means they have a new reply.

'Reopened' is well understood and it gives people peace of mind knowing their question can be opened again.

### Finding 5: There's an expectation that inquiries marked as solved by VA will not actually feel solved for Veterans.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

People understand that 'Solved' means there's a reply from VA.

But, Veterans have low expectations something marked as 'Solved' will actually feel solved to them. Even before they read the reply, they anticipate frustration.

Fittingly, VA's reply was often misunderstood, 'too long' or 'obviously copy and pasted.'

If responses are not specific and personal, people prefer to use instant, automated tools. This includes business submitters, who turn to Ask VA for more complex questions, expecting more specific answers.

### Finding 6: It's more intuitive to read and save a conversation that's in chronological order.

_Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: AVA`_

The order of the question details page surprised and frustrated people, who expect to read the VA's reply before they choose whether to reply back.

It's easier for people to read a conversation in chronological order, similar to an email chain.

Also, business submitters need to print the conversation for their files. They currently use workarounds, like creating a Word document, to save the conversation in an easy to read format.

Many people aren't sure how to print without a print button.

## Additional insights

- Most people immediately understand that this was where they can find their previous questions.
- It's easy for people to find the 'Ask a new question' call-to-action.
- How to sort using dropdown list is well understood.
- Check details link is well understood.
- How to send a reply is well understood.
- People can return to their dashboard after submitting a reply.
- When business tab is first, it's saves an extra click and helps hide personal questions.
- Knowing how long it takes to receive a reply helps people understand Ask VA.
- Veterans will look for Ask VA in the app or under Contact Us.
- Those familiar with VA.gov, expect  questions to show up in My VA.

## Recommendations

1. Make it easier to compare last date updated with date submitted.
2. Help people find items based on category (now) or keyword search (in the future).
3. Remove 'New' status and start with 'In progress' to lessen confusion.
4. Change 'Solved' status to 'Closed' or 'Replied' to clarify intent.
5. Recommend plain language overhaul of responses from VA.
6. Move 'Your question' to 'Your conversation' and 'Send a reply' to the last item on the page.
7. Add print button to question details page.
8. Reiterate that a question has been 'Reopened' on the reply confirmation page.
9. Add 7 day turnaround time to subtitle on unauthenticated and auth homepages.

## Next steps

## Further research needed

We are planning additional research on the dashboard with assistive technology users in August-September 2024. We'll reassess changes we've made to the user experience at that point, and also understand how they work for people who use assistive technology.

## Underserved groups we haven’t talked to 

We have completed the [VA Recruitment Checker for marginalized Veteran groups](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit#gid=1221033726).

We only had 1 no show so we exceeded our target of 6 participants. We aimed to fill gaps in our previous studies. So, we specifically called out Asian or Hispanic demographics when we recruited, because we haven't been able to recruit participants from these demographics in our last two studies. Still, we did not recruit any Asian participants. Also, this study did not recruit for other than honorable, immigrant origin, expat or AT users.
