## Intro (5 minutes)

> Start transcript: `LIVE TRANSCRIPT` > `ENABLE`.

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tyler]. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact VA online if they have a question.

**What I hope to do today** is get a sense of how we can make this process better.

**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration that may have led you to contact VA - or even frustration you've had with actually contacting VA - in the past. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustrations in case they're things we can improve in the future.

So before we get started, when Perigean set up this session, they asked if you’re okay with a couple of observers joining us. This helps my team members learn from our conversation as well, and they also help me take notes so we capture everything you share.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to observe?**

- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. Can everyone say hello? This is `PARTICIPANT`.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure writing is clear.
- **I’m going to share a prototype with you today.** This is like a test version of the website, so it may not work exactly how you expect. For example, you’ll be able to click some buttons, but not all of them. Also, if the prototype says something like, "you have a 70% disability rating," that's pretend information. I don't want it to alarm you if you read anything, because it's all just made up for the purpose of this session.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- Last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm up (5 minutes)

It seems like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with the VA and our online services.

- I'm curious, how long have you been a Veteran?
- Have you ever contacted the VA online or over the phone?
  - `IF NO`
    - Why might you contact the VA?
    - If you were going to contact the VA, would you prefer to call, go online or get in touch another way?
  - `IF YES`
    - Can you tell me about a time when you contacted the VA?
    - How do you usually contact the VA? Why?
    - How was the support you received?
    - Have you ever heard of Ask VA or AVA?

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>

- Why do they choose to contact VA (instead of going elsewhere or doing another task)?
- How do they decide which channel to use when they contact the VA?
- Are they familiar with Ask VA?

</details>

## Set up (5 minutes)

Thanks, it’s helpful to learn about your experience with the VA.

Now, we're going to shift gear. And I'd like to share something with you to get your feedback.

In the Zoom chat, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a test version of a website. It might not work perfectly, but this way we can learn what we need to improve before we share it with more Veterans.

> Send link in Zoom chat.

* [VETERAN - Desktop prototype](add link)
* [VETERAN - Mobile prototype](add link)

- Can you open the link in the chat?
- Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?
  - `IF YES` Great. Can you please share your screen?
  - `IF NO` I’ll walk you through how to do that…

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too.

> Screen: Dashboard

Okay, so before we look at this, I want to explain the scenario.

Ask VA is an online tool that Veterans and can use to ask the VA a question. You can ask questions about all different topics, like health care or housing assistance, for example.

And in this scenario, let's pretend like you're kind of familiar with Ask VA. Last year, you used Ask VA to ask a question about homa loans. And recently, you've submitted 2 more questions to the VA.

And so, take a look at your screen now. We see that we're on Ask VA and we're pretending like you're signed in. This is your account.

- How does that sound? Does everything feel clear at this point?

Okay, great. So now I'm going to ask you some questions about this page. If the scenario is confusing to you, just let me know.

## Dashboard (20 minutes)

So, first off...

- Can you describe this page to me? What are you noticing?

Great. So, let's say you got an email from the VA, letting you know that they replied to your question. You can read your reply once you sign in to Ask VA.

- Without clicking anything yet, can you tell me what you would look for? You want to find the VA's reply to your question.
- How would you find the right question to click on?
- What does the date mean?
- What does this mean, where it says, "Health care"?
- What does 'new' mean?
- What does 'solved' mean?

Okay, so at this point, you want to click on the Solved question.

- Without clicking yet, can you tell me where you would click next?
- What do you expect to happen when you click 'Check details'?

## Question details (20 minutes)

> Screen: Question details

Alright, so now we're on this page.

- First, can you describe this page to me? What are you noticing?
- Is this what you expect to find on this page?
- Is anything missing?

Remembering our scenario...

- What would you do first on this page?
- Can you find the reponse from the VA?

I'll give you a minute to read their reply.

- What are your thoughts, after reading that?
- Is this what you expected?
- If you had a follow question, can you reply to the VA?
- If you couldn't reply back to the VA – let's say it didn't let you reply – what would you do to follow up?

Okay, let's say you wanted to write the VA a reply to follow up.

- Without clicking anything yet, can you describe how you would reply to the VA?

Great. Well, we can't actually type in the prototype today. But let's click on that box where you would type, and we'll pretend like you typed in your reply.

> Screen: Reply drafted

So, now we see your reply has been drafted.

- What would you do next?

Great. Let's go ahead and click send.

> Screen: Reply sent

I'll give you a minute to read this page.

- Can you summarize this page for me?
- Is anything missing from this page?
- How do you get back to the Ask VA homepage from here?

Okay, awesome. Let's go ahead and click 'Return to Ask VA.'

> Screen: Dashboard

- What page are we on now?
- Has anything on this page changed, since you sent your reply to the VA?

## Cool down (5 minutes)

Okay, we’re all finished with the prototype. So you can stop sharing your screen now.

> Stop sharing screen

I’d love to spend a little time reflecting before we finish.

- What did you think of that process? Is there anything you liked?
- Is there anything that could have been easier?
- Let's say you wanted to tell another Veteran about Ask VA. How would you describe it to them?
- If they needed help finding their reply from the VA, what would you tell them?
- Is there anything else you want to share with me, about this process?

<details>
  <summary>Key things to notice</summary>
  
- What did they like and what would they change?
- [Add additional key things to notice]

</details>
   
Well, I think you've answered all of my questions.

Thanks again for sharing your time with me. It’s been so helpful to learn from you.

**Do you have any questions for me?**

Okay, well thank you so much for the time.

Perigean will send you a thank you note with some information that you can pass along to other Veterans if they’d like to participate in future research sessions. 

I hope you have a lovely rest of the day.

## Pause or exit strategies

We can use this strategies to prepare for difficult situations.

### If the participant isn't feeling well

I'm sorry you're [not feeling well]. Do you feel up for continuing? You'll be paid even if we stop early.

> If they choose to continue...

Okay, just let me know if you change your mind.

### If the participant is showing signs of upset or distress

This sounds so hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?

> If they choose to take a break and come back...

Welcome back. I'm interested to hear more about [topic you left off on]. Are you up for continuing or would you prefer we move to the next topic?

### If the participant decides to stop

Thank you for your time today, I completely understand your decision to stop.

> If they seem distressed...

Before you go, the VA Hotline number is 988, it's a confidential helpline, and it's 24/7. It's up to you whether you call.

### If the participant is fine to continue, but you aren't

I hear that you're okay to continue. Before we do, I realized that I need a minute. I'm going to turn off my camera and microphone, and get a glass of water. Is that okay with you? I'll be back in 3 minutes.

> If you're still not able to continue, after you pause...

Thanks for letting me take a break. You didn't do anything wrong, but I'm realizing that I'm not going to be able to continue this session. You will still be paid for the full time. I really appreciate you sharing with me today. Is it okay with you if we stop? Thanks very much.
