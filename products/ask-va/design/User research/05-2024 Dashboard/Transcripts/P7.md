### Warm up

Tyler: Awesome. So I just wanna confirm again, are you comfortable? If I record my screen and audio today.

> P7: Yes.

Tyler: Okay, perfect. So that was a lot of information in a couple of minutes. Do you have questions for me at this point.

4
00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:15.920
> P7: No.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.650
Tyler: Okay.

6
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:28.170
Tyler: awesome. Well, let's get started before we start looking at a prototype. I want to learn just a little bit more about your background and your experience with the Va how long have you been a veteran.

7
00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:33.610
> P7: I joined the the military in 2,007, got out in 2013.

8
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.720
> P7: So since since then.

9
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.590
Tyler: Okay? And how did you start interacting with the Va like, right after you got out of service in 2,013 or just a month.

10
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.920
> P7: It is.

11
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:44.869
Tyler: Few years.

12
00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.440
> P7: I didn't start till 2015.

13
00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:48.430
Tyler: Okay.

14
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.250
> P7: My 1st interactions with the meeting.

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.060
Tyler: Do you remember how you 1st got in touch with the Va.

16
00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:57.029
> P7: I did a Google search.

17
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.009
> P7: basically. Yes.

18
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.000
Tyler: Yeah.

19
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.095
> P7: And then I got I got I got some info from from old

20
00:01:07.185 --> 00:01:07.820
> P7: colleagues

21
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:13.898
> P7: and then, like they basically went to the big Va. Hospital here in my town, my city, Las Vegas.

22
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.320
> P7: And

23
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.584
> P7: yeah, it wasn't good experience at 1.st 2015 at all.

24
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.220
Tyler: Yeah.

25
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.810
Tyler: So it wasn't a good experience going in. No.

26
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.400
> P7: Not.

27
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.890
> P7: Do you want to talk?

28
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.240
Tyler: Call me. Yeah.

29
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.280
> P7: Oh, yeah, everything was just very confusing. Like all their website, they they have.

30
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:46.490
> P7: I don't know, like 5 different websites, and they're all do some different stuff and kinda hard to really find information online. And then when you when I 1st went to the hospital, it was really really hard, just finding where to

31
00:01:46.490 --> 00:02:12.810
> P7: go, ask for like what department, and go check out just to get signed up when I did get when I did find where to go get signed up. The lady was very very rushy, very rude. Kind of seem like she wanted to go to learns telling me I didn't I qualify for va disability when I actually am a Iraq War veteran? So I was at a corrector. I was like, pretty sure, have you? What you've gone to Iraq. You qualify for some Va benefits. She was just like

32
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.729
> P7: kind of dismissing me, and so just even signing up, for the view was just a headache.

33
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.830
Tyler: Yeah.

34
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.590
Tyler: yeah, that sounds really, yeah. That sounds like, not a good experience. Like you said,

35
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.740
> P7: Not at all. Yeah. So yeah, kind of turned me off. And

36
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.059
> P7: I did go to some. Some try to file for disability benefits. And

37
00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.609
> P7: that was just very

38
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.910
> P7: confusing. Also it was just 2,015. They just gave me, like a stack of paperwork to fill out, and

39
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:54.850
> P7: you know, with a whole bunch of information that they wanted, that I did not, you know, have records, for did not remember so I never got that done. I I did end up going to try to seek some therapy, for, like

40
00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:08.240
> P7: some depression. They ended up. Sign me up for a psychiatrist, which back then I did not know the difference, and that that guy, the psychiatrist, is very rude, kinda just assuming that I was there for

41
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.680
> P7: to get some prescription Meds and

42
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:24.330
> P7: and I had it correct. I was like, I'm not here for any minutes, he's like, well, why did come see me? I was like I didn't sign up to see you. They I asked for a therapist. They send me to you, and it was it was very I. I was very irate at a Va. And

43
00:03:24.687 --> 00:03:28.940
> P7: after that I never really went back to the Va. Till, like maybe

44
00:03:29.722 --> 00:03:31.410
> P7: I would say 20,

45
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.790
> P7: 1819. So it took me like 4 years, 5 years to go back to actually

46
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.870
> P7: file for disability. And

47
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.939
> P7: that's after, you know, I found out that my colleagues were that kind of pushing me towards it because

48
00:03:44.303 --> 00:03:56.590
> P7: I'm a realtor, so I can reconnect it with some people, and they kind of told me what you know. They? They started getting some disability, so made some of them push me to go back to the Va. So I finally started doing it back in like 2018 2019, I think.

49
00:03:57.054 --> 00:03:59.779
> P7: And finally, yeah, and that was.

50
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.063
> P7: yeah, brief. You know, history of my Va experience.

51
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.369
Tyler: Yeah, thanks for sharing that with me. That sounds tough, and I think it's a

52
00:04:09.784 --> 00:04:15.479
Tyler: a kind of a common experience for veterans to almost like need to step away from the Va. When they've

53
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:31.130
Tyler: like you said you had like 4 or 5 years in between that 1st interaction. Because obviously, it's a lot of it's a lot of work. And obviously like emotional as well to have to like describe your disability or how you've been impacted. So

54
00:04:31.807 --> 00:04:39.239
Tyler: I'm glad that you are hopefully you know, able to receive care and things like that from the Va. But

55
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.810
Tyler: sorry that it's not simpler.

56
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.419
> P7: Yeah, no, it's okay. It's not good.

57
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:52.599
Tyler: When you contact the Va these days, do you usually like go into the Va, or do you ever call on the phone or go online.

58
00:04:53.083 --> 00:05:07.466
> P7: I usually try to call on the phone. Just find it a little simple. I do have some numbers saved on my phone contacts. So I just kinda just mark. And I just hope the operator kinda relays me to the right you know department.

59
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:09.710
> P7: That's that's usually my

60
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.650
> P7: go to.

61
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.379
Tyler: Are you usually calling the medical center like things to do with healthcare?

62
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.439
> P7: Yeah, yeah.

63
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.679
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Have you ever used something called my healthy vet.

64
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.490
> P7: Yes, I have used my my help here before.

65
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.170
Tyler: Who?

66
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.809
> P7: Remind me. Which one? What?

67
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.829
> P7: What's the purpose of that website?

68
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:41.399
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of different websites. My healthy vet's more focused on healthcare. And I guess I'm asking, because I'm curious. If you've ever messaged your doctor online.

69
00:05:42.146 --> 00:05:45.349
> P7: No, I have not used it for that. I've used it for

70
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.830
> P7: trying to find my records.

71
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.490
Tyler: Okay.

72
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.139
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense.

73
00:05:50.595 --> 00:05:53.700
Tyler: Have you ever heard of something called? Ask BA.

74
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.019
> P7: Ask Fee. I have heard of that one. I don't. I don't think I've used it.

75
00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.860
Tyler: Okay.

76
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:11.240
Tyler: well, that's not a problem. I'm gonna actually show you ask Va, because that's something we're gonna be talking about today. It's not a problem if you haven't heard of it, or used it, or or anything like that. But I'll share my screen really quick.

77
00:06:11.881 --> 00:06:13.390
Tyler: Just so you can see

78
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.920
Tyler: what Sva looks like.

79
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:23.130
Tyler: so this is a tool that veterans and other folks can use to contact the Va online.

80
00:06:23.596 --> 00:06:29.779
Tyler: You can ask questions about like healthcare or housing assistance. A bunch of different topics.

81
00:06:30.754 --> 00:06:37.900
Tyler: So it's essentially like a an online contact form that you've you've probably seen one of those on another website before. Right.

82
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.330
> P7: Yes, yes.

83
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.940
Tyler: Okay.

84
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.770
Tyler: And

85
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:51.729
Tyler: we're gonna pretend like for this session. We're gonna pretend like you're familiar with. Ask Va, so we're gonna say, like you've used ask Va. And a couple of times in the past to ask questions.

86
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.319
Tyler: at this point. Do you have any questions about ask Va or this scenario that we're gonna be in today.

87
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.080
Tyler: Okay.

88
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.919
Tyler: I'll go ahead and stop sharing my screen. So it's just like a basic idea of of kind of what we're thinking about. You've submitted some questions to the Va

89
00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:18.289
Tyler: and now we're gonna shift gears a little bit. I'm gonna send something for you to open on your screen and I'm gonna send that in. Are you on your computer on your phone?

90
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.310
> P7: My computer.

91
00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:19.900
Tyler: Okay.

92
00:07:20.462 --> 00:07:23.189
Tyler: I'm going to send a link in the Zoom chat.

93
00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.460
Tyler: and then, if you can just open that for me and and let me know once it's loaded.

94
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.850
> P7: It's loading.

95
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.740
Tyler: Okay.

96
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:45.580
> P7: Still learning.

97
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.059
> P7: Okay, it's up.

98
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.509
Tyler: Okay, awesome. So now we're gonna share your screen on. Zoom, have you done that recently?

99
00:07:55.228 --> 00:07:56.269
> P7: Yes, I've done it before.

100
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.560
Tyler: Okay, cool. So I'll give you a minute to just share your screen.

101
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.720
> P7: Share

102
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.660
> P7: desktop.

103
00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.530
Tyler: Let me know if you need a hand.

104
00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:58.949
> P7: Saying, I have to quit

105
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:01.050
> P7: zoom to share.

106
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:01.910
Tyler: Okay.

107
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.030
> P7: Like to record this computer screen.

108
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:14.819
Tyler: Yeah, sometimes, if you haven't given zoom permission, you'll have to give it permission. So we have 2 options. One is we can do that if you feel like you want to go change your settings.

109
00:09:15.168 --> 00:09:21.620
Tyler: The other option is, I can share my screen, but you won't be able to click, I'll have to click for you. Do you have a preference.

110
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.101
> P7: I think that'd probably be easier.

111
00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.009
Tyler: Let's do that. I'll open it up on my screen.

112
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.280
Tyler: Alright. So I'm gonna share my screen. Now.

113
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.990
Tyler: can you see that on your side?

114
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.760
> P7: Yes.

115
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:55.729
Tyler: Okay, perfect. So since I'm sharing my screen now, you're gonna have to say things like, Okay, can you please scroll down? Because obviously, I won't know when you when you want to do something. But otherwise this will work perfectly fine. Okay.

116
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:08.929
Tyler: awesome. So we're looking at the screen, and we can see that we're on. Ask Va. And we're pretending like you're signed in. So it says Jordan. Up here in the top right corner. We're gonna pretend like that says your name. And this is your account. Okay?

117
00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.140
Tyler: So

118
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:19.690
Tyler: 1st off, and you can let me know when you want me to scroll I'd love for you to just take a look around and describe what you're noticing on this page.

119
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.980
> P7: China.

120
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.139
> P7: The 1st intent was to try to find out what this page is for. So I see. Ask Va.

121
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.059
> P7: On the top, and then get answers to your questions about Va. Benefits and services.

122
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.220
> P7: So that, and then ask me any question. I guess that's the 1st thing I looked at.

123
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.420
Tyler: awesome. So like, 1st thing, you're trying to do you said is figure out what this page is about which.

124
00:10:49.734 --> 00:10:50.050
> P7: Yeah.

125
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:55.649
Tyler: Was kind of up at the talk. That makes sense. And then you saw this link for asking a new question.

126
00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.610
Tyler: yeah, that's helpful.

127
00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.950
> P7: And like, for now I guess I'd just be curious on what

128
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.189
> P7: what that link does. And then also.

129
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.419
> P7: let's call my attention as these 2 boxes on the bottom.

130
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.970
> P7: Sign a main call to integration.

131
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.010
> P7: says Keynesian.

132
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.130
> P7: disabled. Do my defense get healthcare?

133
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.890
> P7: Yeah, I'm after that little.

134
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.419
> P7: just a little confused on these boxes, you know.

135
00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:32.120
Tyler: Yeah, no, that's that's helpful.

136
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.509
> P7: That's updated order status.

137
00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.139
> P7: Yeah. So everything below.

138
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.942
> P7: I guess, starting from your questions and below is kinda just confusing. Like.

139
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:49.659
> P7: is this just general, does it have to do with me.

140
00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.530
Tyler: Make, sense.

141
00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:59.739
> P7: Training and technical issue. May 2624. How do I access care? Messaging on the Va. Website?

142
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.410
> P7: I like to send a scheme message to my friend, information status new.

143
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:04.750
> P7: That's updated.

144
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.319
> P7: Yes, I don't know

145
00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.199
> P7: really what that sign in and techno issues is.

146
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:22.049
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So the beginning of the page felt clear. You kind of understood what this is about, and then everything kind of down below is a little more confusing. So I'm gonna give a little bit of context.

147
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.459
Tyler: we're gonna pretend, like you've asked the Va. A couple of questions in the past.

148
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.120
> P7: Okay.

149
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.982
Tyler: So these would be the questions you've asked.

150
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.940
Tyler: So knowing that, does that feel more?

151
00:12:36.346 --> 00:12:40.200
Tyler: Straightforward? Or is it still a little bit confusing what these boxes are.

152
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:45.589
> P7: Yeah, if if I'm the one who typed that question as, how do I access secure messaging

153
00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.265
> P7: on the Va website, customer and all that. And then

154
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.600
> P7: I would like to. Yeah, I would. I would probably remember that that I wrote it like that verbatim.

155
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:55.660
Tyler: Right.

156
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.750
> P7: You know, and then status new, last updated.

157
00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:03.369
> P7: and then check details. I guess I would click that to see if they answer my question correct.

158
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:04.420
> P7: and then

159
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:08.109
> P7: and then I guess I would have asked. I'm 70% disabled.

160
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:13.759
> P7: Do my independence get healthcare as well? Thanks. On May 21st 2024,

161
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:19.840
> P7: and then I guess solve means. They answered my question, so I guess I would have already

162
00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.269
> P7: check that and

163
00:13:23.391 --> 00:13:25.379
> P7: can you click on check details?

164
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:44.079
Tyler: I'm gonna hold off one moment before we do that, but we will get there. But that was really helpful. Just like watching you walk through everything. So a notice you're noticing like, if you had typed these questions yourself, it would feel more familiar. And you that probably wouldn't. You wouldn't have had to like be confused. Which makes sense.

165
00:13:44.270 --> 00:13:56.211
Tyler: And then you talked a little bit through, like some of the information like you said you submitted this question on May 21.st you talked about how it's solved. So that probably means that there's a reply.

166
00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:03.350
Tyler: that's really helpful. What does it mean where it says, like sign in and technical issues, healthcare. What's that mean?

167
00:14:04.298 --> 00:14:05.729
> P7: I guess they're they're

168
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.120
> P7: either. Either I

169
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:12.029
> P7: clicked on category like the category of a question, or they categorized it for me.

170
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.210
Tyler: okay?

171
00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:20.799
Tyler: And then if you know, we're in your account. And we're looking at your questions, why is it helpful for you to see

172
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.800
Tyler: that

173
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:23.080
Tyler: category.

174
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:27.854
> P7: I makes it everything, everything more organized and

175
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:30.369
> P7: gives me more

176
00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:32.430
> P7: just clarity on

177
00:14:33.286 --> 00:14:35.470
> P7: what I'm trying to ask.

178
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.640
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense.

179
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:50.809
Tyler: And I'm seeing a couple of different dates, so we mentioned may 21, st you think that's probably the day it was submitted. And then we've got a last updated date. What is that?

180
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.380
Tyler: Probably referring to.

181
00:14:52.380 --> 00:15:01.559
> P7: And probably referring to when either they they asked my question or they answered my question, or maybe I don't know if you're able to go in there and edit it.

182
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:02.150
Tyler: Hmm.

183
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.910
> P7: Chandler.

184
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:04.850
Tyler: Okay.

185
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:05.530
> P7: 7.

186
00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:05.870
Tyler: Yeah.

187
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.601
> P7: Off of off the top, I would assume. That's when they

188
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:12.960
> P7: They either try to reply, give me a reply, or answer my question.

189
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:24.989
Tyler: yeah. And then looking at this, page, there's 3 questions that you've submitted on this page which ones of them, do you think, have a reply from the Va.

190
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:29.720
> P7: think

191
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.180
> P7: 6.

192
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:41.229
> P7: I think so. Maybe new. I'm not sure that means if it's a new question by me, or if they've got a new

193
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.949
> P7: new reply from them, and you reply back from them. So I'm not quite sure

194
00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.690
> P7: with that new, because I guess

195
00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:54.350
> P7: I'm assuming the top. May 2620, 24, is, when I created the the question.

196
00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.470
> P7: Unless it hasn't. I guess I've just been updated. I'm not sure.

197
00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.609
> P7: If that update time is after this the same day.

198
00:16:03.656 --> 00:16:05.709
> P7: So I don't know if it's new means.

199
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:11.470
> P7: If that's a new question that I created, or if that means I've got a new reply from back from the Va.

200
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:13.330
Tyler: Right.

201
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.199
> P7: So obviously solved, I would assume it's been.

202
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.720
> P7: and

203
00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.199
> P7: we've been chatting back and forth. They've been answering my questions and then.

204
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.240
> P7: at thanks.

205
00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:30.040
> P7: I've decided to close it out, and you know it's been. Say that it's been solved. My! My questions been answered right.

206
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:31.110
Tyler: Right?

207
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:41.259
Tyler: Okay, cool. So that's really helpful. New is kind of confusing. It's not really clear if it's like a new reply, or you just submitted it and then solved

208
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:42.320
Tyler: is.

209
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:47.759
Tyler: you're you're thinking it means like we've had a back and forth conversation, and we re rebrig.

210
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.069
> P7: This inclusion? Yeah, exactly.

211
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.319
Tyler: Okay. And you said, resolved just now.

212
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:57.060
> P7: Basically, I feel like, you know, it's done, and it's done with.

213
00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.280
Tyler: Yeah.

214
00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:02.410
Tyler: is there a difference between the words like solved and resolved

215
00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.690
Tyler: in your head?

216
00:17:05.609 --> 00:17:06.400
> P7: not

217
00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.560
> P7: not really.

218
00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:08.399
Tyler: Okay.

219
00:17:09.379 --> 00:17:13.539
Tyler: what about solved versus closed? So does that have any difference.

220
00:17:15.017 --> 00:17:19.409
> P7: Yeah close. I guess. More clear like it's been done. It's done with.

221
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.750
Tyler: and who do you think decides when something's solved?

222
00:17:26.594 --> 00:17:27.746
> P7: I would hope

223
00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.787
> P7: would hope it's me.

224
00:17:32.037 --> 00:17:32.912
> P7: You know.

225
00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:43.840
> P7: yeah. But I'm not. It doesn't believe just seeing solve. I can't really tell if it's me or the Va. Saying it's done.

226
00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.800
Tyler: Yeah.

227
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.170
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense.

228
00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:50.560
Tyler: So

229
00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.589
Tyler: I'm kind of curious. Let's say that like you.

230
00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:11.239
Tyler: you knew that you asked the Va. A long time ago about home loans. But you couldn't remember what they told you. So you signed back in today because you wanted to read their response. So you were back here on this page, and I know you don't have a lot of questions here yet.

231
00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:17.899
Tyler: But let's say there was a couple of more questions. So you're looking through a bunch of questions. You're trying to find this question about home loans.

232
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.099
Tyler: How would you find that? What would you do first.st

233
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.910
> P7: So if I if I wanted to review my question, I I would go on here.

234
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:28.260
> P7: and then

235
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.780
> P7: obviously, I see housing assistance and home loans, so

236
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.640
> P7: I mean I would I would

237
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.710
> P7: look for if I had many questions I would look for, or

238
00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:48.029
> P7: I guess, a small amount, a handful of questions. Maybe I would if I would just look for the housing assistance and home loans. Highlighted right there.

239
00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.349
> P7: The category, and then see if that's the question I'm looking for.

240
00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:55.443
> P7: If I have many questions, I guess I would just go to

241
00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.159
> P7: you know I would.

242
00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:03.389
> P7: For some reason there's no filters up in the top to filter for the category.

243
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.460
> P7: Guess I wouldn't

244
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.457
> P7: be. I would be annoying that there's no filters.

245
00:19:08.456 --> 00:19:14.880
> P7: So I would try to filter by if I knew it was solved or not by status

246
00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:20.250
> P7: last updated. I don't. I don't think I would use that to to find it.

247
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:24.789
> P7: so I guess I would just be annoyed that there's no filter for categories, and then

248
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.629
> P7: like, what's the purpose of having it?

249
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.249
> P7: Yeah, having the category on there, if I can't, you know, search

250
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:34.360
> P7: using the categories, if I had many to score scroll through.

251
00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.400
Tyler: Yeah.

252
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:39.360
> P7: If it's if it's just 3 like this, this is fine. But if there's many, then yeah.

253
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:44.360
Tyler: Yeah, I love that description that was really helpful. So

254
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:56.260
Tyler: it sounds like that category like that. Keyword would be your preference for for how to like find things. And so you noticed that that's not an option up here. It's just last updated, or status

255
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:06.429
Tyler: And what if you had like, let's say, like all of your questions were in the same category like you only asked questions about healthcare.

256
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.510
Tyler: What do you think you would be looking for in that pace

257
00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.300
Tyler: what piece of information would help you find questions.

258
00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.320
> P7: some

259
00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.239
> P7: would be.

260
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:24.770
> P7: So it was all healthcare. And then, yeah, be scrolling, trying to find the question.

261
00:20:25.378 --> 00:20:28.239
> P7: I guess I would. I would probably use the

262
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:31.569
> P7: newest to oldest, or, you know, last updated or

263
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.730
> P7: oldest to newest. Hopefully.

264
00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:38.680
> P7: Okay, that's it. Newest to what is oldest to newest. And then I would just still be scrolling.

265
00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.690
> P7: Then I guess I would try to do a status thing to

266
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.350
> P7: filter, or to

267
00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:46.699
> P7: what is it? Narrow it down a little bit

268
00:20:47.236 --> 00:20:49.770
> P7: new in progress. I'll reopen.

269
00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:56.200
> P7: And I would just be also be hoping like, just like you. If you do on online banking, you can

270
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.770
> P7: look at your transactions and just put like a keyword, and I'll kind of like.

271
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:10.540
> P7: Narrow it down that way. I'll just be kinda annoyed again and be be wondering why the Va. Gets all this money, and I can't put us just simple key search work.

272
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.205
> P7: On their websites.

273
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.690
> P7: I guess I would be annoyed if I had a many questions on all in the same category, and I'd have to scroll.

274
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:19.550
Tyler: Yeah.

275
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:27.410
Tyler: that makes sense. I can see how that would be annoying. And it would probably take a while to kind of look around. And it sounds like what you've

276
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:37.239
Tyler: like identified is, it's missing a way for you to just search some keywords so like. If it was, all your questions are about healthcare, then can I look

277
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.750
Tyler: for that question about my dependence, or whatever.

278
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.020
> P7: Yeah, exactly.

279
00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.829
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense.

280
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.739
> P7: And just, you know.

281
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:50.789
Tyler: Yeah. So so while we have this open, we've got this status. Menu opened.

282
00:21:50.950 --> 00:22:01.500
Tyler: and we can see a couple of statuses in here we already talked about new, and then we talked about solved. But it looks like we've got in progress and reopened. What do you think those statuses mean?

283
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:03.969
> P7: And was near

284
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.080
> P7: progress. So

285
00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.459
> P7: I guess so, just like if I just clicked on the status.

286
00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:11.850
> P7: But I had not known

287
00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.359
> P7: they never use our website before. And click, I would guess new would be like me

288
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.739
> P7: having created a new question and progress would be

289
00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:24.330
> P7: them. Finally replying the 1st reply back, and we're still

290
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.170
> P7: chatting back and forth.

291
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:32.629
> P7: And then solved would be hopefully, any numbers of resolution to the question

292
00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:36.680
> P7: reopen. Maybe I want to

293
00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.552
> P7: go back to that question. Add more.

294
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:43.080
> P7: that I want to ask them about it.

295
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.100
> P7: and maybe

296
00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:51.460
> P7: top. I guess my 1st impression would be May, okay, I'm able to go back to a solved question and somehow

297
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:53.760
> P7: reopen it, and.

298
00:22:54.365 --> 00:22:54.770
Tyler: Oh!

299
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:57.200
> P7: Ask them again more about it.

300
00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.400
Tyler: yeah.

301
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.842
Tyler: that that makes sense to me, that whole. All of the way you described all of those.

302
00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:17.842
Tyler: okay, let's let's go ahead and come back to something you asked earlier, on which was, Can we click on check details? So let's go ahead and check details for this question that you asked on May 21.st

303
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:20.439
Tyler: And before we do that

304
00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.940
Tyler: I'm going to give you like a little bit of a scenario to think about.

305
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:28.500
Tyler: We're here reading this question, thinking, Oh, this was just solved.

306
00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:33.129
Tyler: So you're wanting to know what the Va. Told you like, what? Their reply back was, Okay.

307
00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.930
Tyler: okay? And then let me know what you want me to do when we get to this new page.

308
00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.920
> P7: Sales healthcare sent me

309
00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:59.490
> P7: solve reference number

310
00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.200
> P7: 100. Reply.

311
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.919
> P7: So I see that your question. That's a question I asked

312
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:14.470
> P7: details. Okay, healthcare. Didn't you sent?

313
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.899
> P7: Sent May 21st status solved.

314
00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:25.991
> P7: Send a reply message. So yeah, I'm I'm just confused. What? What? Exactly was solved

315
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:27.970
> P7: Did?

316
00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.569
> P7: I'll see any answer to the question.

317
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.110
> P7: Yeah.

318
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.690
> P7: so

319
00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:37.259
> P7: just yeah.

320
00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.330
> P7: you know, where's where's the answer to the question, you know.

321
00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:44.537
> P7: how is this even solved?

322
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.020
Tyler: Yeah.

323
00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:51.790
Tyler: yeah. So immediately, like, yes, we see it solved. But we're like, why.

324
00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:52.750
> P7: Yeah.

325
00:24:53.282 --> 00:24:55.059
Tyler: Do you want me to scroll down anyone.

326
00:24:56.879 --> 00:24:57.389
> P7: Yes!

327
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.029
Tyler: I'll scroll down a little bit.

328
00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.690
> P7: Okay, replies and conversation. Okay, the conversations right? There.

329
00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:04.370
Tyler: Okay.

330
00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.250
Tyler: So that felt a little bit lost. Right?

331
00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:13.596
> P7: Yeah, yeah, I'd be looking. And then maybe I finally tried to set a scroll. I guess.

332
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.499
> P7: So. Response from Va, okay, that's good. I think

333
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.630
> P7: I know exactly. This is what the Va. Roads, not

334
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.140
> P7: something I wrote.

335
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:27.080
> P7: Although you have a shampoo.

336
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.359
> P7: Burns, please.

337
00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:31.560
> P7: Same time.

338
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:40.940
> P7: I guess I go up from there and scroll back. Can you scroll up again.

339
00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.110
> P7: So I guess I'm assuming

340
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:59.009
> P7: it's just they're they're they want the to put the older questions or the older chats in the bottom and the newers on top right?

341
00:25:59.608 --> 00:26:01.039
> P7: That way. You don't

342
00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.440
> P7: scroll the way to

343
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:12.639
> P7: to look at the newest chats. That's that's why they have the reply stuff before that I can read the chat. I I believe.

344
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:13.560
> P7: So.

345
00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:23.210
> P7: Yeah, if if if I'm just gonna go and review a cold question like

346
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:25.999
> P7: I guess I would prefer the

347
00:26:27.401 --> 00:26:33.550
> P7: not scrolling. It's like, why do I need the reply box first, st like it's been solved like

348
00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:43.429
Tyler: Totally so. It felt like it wasn't meeting your expectations like you're here to look for your reply.

349
00:26:43.972 --> 00:26:44.970
> P7: And then just.

350
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.800
Tyler: Yeah. And then. Now, it's not in that order

351
00:26:51.830 --> 00:27:03.540
Tyler: let's go ahead and look a little bit more, closely at their reply, so the question was that you know in this case your 70 disability rating, and you want to see if your dependents can get healthcare coverage also.

352
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:11.251
Tyler: So I think you've skimmed this reply. But tell me what you're thinking. You can read it more closely. But tell me afterwards,

353
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.590
Tyler: Like what you're thinking about. The Va's response.

354
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:19.759
> P7: Okay. Hello! You have reached an Va. App from exclusively for family members

355
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.010
> P7: of service members, slash veins who are determined

356
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:23.565
> P7: perfect

357
00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.380
> P7: service connected to the same Board

358
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.160
> P7: Office range. So they are being paid.

359
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:31.309
> P7: Send you to. But I don't know.

360
00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:33.700
> P7: Dice or Smith.

361
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.549
> P7: Why not? What does that look

362
00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.660
> P7: reach out to that

363
00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:44.490
> P7: super.

364
00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.759
> P7: Yeah. Can can I go back up to the question again?

365
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:56.490
Tyler: Yeah.

366
00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:03.189
> P7: So I asked, I'm 70%. Do my dependence get healthcare as well? Thanks. And then I scroll down.

367
00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:04.540
> P7: I'll scroll down

368
00:28:05.357 --> 00:28:10.922
> P7: you have the champ. Va shampoo. Va? Yeah. I don't know what Champ Va is.

369
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:16.710
> P7: I guess I went to ask Va. For this question, so I I don't know what Champ Va is, and

370
00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:25.050
> P7: why do I care? Our program is exclusively for family members of service members. Such veterans who are determined, permanent in total

371
00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.749

> P7: care coverage for veterans.

374
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:37.989
> P7: Yeah, that is very

375
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:43.109
> P7: confusions, like a whole paragraph, or like a run on sentence. I don't know, like.

376
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:51.260
> P7: It's just one. You know. Our program is exclusively for family members of service members, slash veterans.

377
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:56.509
> P7: full time members of service members sash who are determined per minute in total

> P7: whose range show they are being paid.

380
00:29:03.492 --> 00:29:07.809
> P7: I would prefer like maybe a colon, and then bullet points on who

381
00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.189
> P7: is eligible instead of this whole big old sentence with commas. And I'm just like.

382
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.940
Tyler: Yeah.

383
00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:18.560
> P7: You know, cause ago, sometimes you read a Ca, you know, comma, and you know they're just listing stuff.

384
00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.100
> P7: or it's like.

385
00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.720
> P7: just maybe more info on whatever they're talking about. So it's just lots of reading.

386
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.240
Tyler: Yeah.

387
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.699
> P7: Trying to decipher what they're trying to say.

388
00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.509
> P7: owner who died service connected or not. Otherwise I'll ever try care.

389
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:38.929
> P7: and then I guess we do not provide care, slash coverage for veterans.

390
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.459
> P7: I'm confused on that, too.

391
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.210
Tyler: Yeah. Chat.

392
00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.650
> P7: Could you navigate for your local Vamc. For assistance?

393
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:53.409
> P7: So the their whole answer is just very confusing. Site, like a Yes or a No.

394
00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:00.200
> P7: you know they're they are. I guess they're giving me kinda like the

395
00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.090
> P7: who is eligible.

396
00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.079
> P7: but they're doing it in like

397
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:10.740
> P7: big ol long sentences instead of just kinda like listing it like simpler way to write it out.

398
00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:11.570
Tyler: Yeah.

399
00:30:11.871 --> 00:30:14.280
> P7: So I'm trying to decipher what they're saying.

400
00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:14.980
Tyler: Yeah.

401
00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:22.040
> P7: And then in the end, like I don't feel like my question was answered, and then, just like we'll reach out to your Vmc. For assistance.

402
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.980
> P7: So right, you must go to.

403
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.406
> P7: Yeah. Complete the submit to address for fax.

404
00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.470
> P7: what am I applying to? To apply? Not sure what

405
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.580
> P7: to apply

406
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.189
> P7: what they're talking about. What

407
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:51.549
> P7: I 1st thought does be like. I wouldn't read the rest of the question like, what are you they trying to say I'm applying to, and then I would kind of go back to the rest. What are they? What they talking to about? What are they talking about? Apply to what? What do they? You know? What do I need apply to? What do they think I need apply to

408
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.400
> P7: for further questions? Call Shannon. Va, okay.

409
00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.210
> P7: it's very confusing. Answer, yeah.

410
00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.330
> P7: I mean.

411
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:10.480
Tyler: I think the number of times that you've had to reread it is kind of is pretty telling, like it's not clear upfront on what they're saying.

412
00:31:11.043 --> 00:31:18.669
Tyler: And like you said, it's not necessarily answering your question. It's kind of like explaining, maybe their program.

413
00:31:19.002 --> 00:31:30.689
Tyler: So that's that's quite confusing. And you talked about ways that like this text could be broken up. So if they do want to explain, okay, here's who's eligible. Then maybe bullet points would make it easier to read and.

414
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:31.380
> P7: Yeah.

415
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:32.160
Tyler: It is a.

416
00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:32.649
> P7: And I would like.

417
00:31:32.987 --> 00:31:34.000
Tyler: With the form.

418
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.700
Tyler: yeah, go ahead. What would you? What do you think you.

419
00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:44.249
> P7: I would like a a separation between like the the answer part near the 1st paragraph, and then the rest was like.

420
00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:44.600
Tyler: Yeah.

421
00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.230
> P7: More like, if you need more help, May. I would maybe like

422
00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:55.230
> P7: maybe, that in like a like, separated by a subtitle like for more help or more info

423
00:31:55.762 --> 00:31:58.090
> P7: visit these links like instead of me

424
00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:04.511
> P7: reading them and see you know, it kinda just feels like, Oh, for more info, for more help go to this.

425
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.110
> P7: you know, and I would like that. Separated from my answer. I think I would.

426
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:11.300
Tyler: Right? Yeah.

427
00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:12.690
Tyler: it's not.

428
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:13.099
> P7: I just do.

429
00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.719
Tyler: Like block of text.

430
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.950
> P7: Yeah, exactly. Just

431
00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.140
> P7: it's just

432
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.540
> P7: when I first, st when you 1st clicked on this, you know the

433
00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:29.420
> P7: more details about this question, and then you scroll down the conversation, and I just saw that big old block I'm just like.

434
00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.839
> P7: Oh, my God! Like.

435
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:37.130
> P7: It's just yeah, I see a whole bunch of links in there and numbers. And

436
00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:39.000
> P7: yeah, just like.

437
00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:39.830
> P7: yeah.

438
00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.279
Tyler: For sure. I think that makes a lot of sense like it. It's not as

439
00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:53.640
Tyler: It's not as maybe personal as it could be in terms of replying to you, and then maybe, if they want to give you extra information.

440
00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:58.490
Tyler: like that could be extra and

441
00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:04.683
Tyler: and I like how you talked about like breaking that into a new section. I think that that all makes sense.

442
00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:16.219
Tyler: let's say you were reading this. And you were like, Okay, I'm still confused, like, I don't really understand. If that means that they're eligible or they're not eligible. So

443
00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:21.729
Tyler: we talked a little bit about this. But there's this option to send the Va. A reply.

444
00:33:23.405 --> 00:33:32.249
Tyler: If you were gonna send a reply to the Va. Like right now, this question says it's solved. Do you think you're able to send a reply to the Va.

445
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:42.849
> P7: Send a reply. It says Solve. And then, since there the the chat box is there for me to send. A reply would assume they're allowing me to send a reply, and then

446
00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:45.119
> P7: then I would send it. But hope.

447
00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:50.520
> P7: you know, just not even knowing if they're gonna reply, cause it says all, so I'm just hoping.

448
00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.240
Tyler: Hmm.

449
00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:56.839
> P7: You know that they they're gonna reply. So I would just I would just try to send the

450
00:33:57.389 --> 00:34:01.280
> P7: we reply, and then just check back later, and then let's see if it worked.

451
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:03.510
> P7: They answer it, not knowing

452
00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:05.290
> P7: if it's going to work.

453
00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:06.340
Tyler: Yeah.

454
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:22.569
Tyler: that makes sense. Kinda hope for the best. But maybe expect expect the worst. Okay, so let's say you were, gonna do that. So you're gonna type in your message here, we can't actually type in this today. But I'm just gonna click in this box. We're gonna pretend, like you typed out a reply.

455
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.099
Tyler: So now we're seeing your reply here.

456
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:30.000
Tyler: and if you wanted to send this to the Va. Can you tell me where you want me to click.

457
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.781
> P7: Okay, I would press. Send

458
00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.020
> P7: Okay, the blue button.

459
00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:39.380
Tyler: Okay, I'll go ahead and click, send, and then I'll give you a minute to read this page.

460
00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:52.710
> P7: Response, and your response should be seen by within 7 days that we need more information as requesting we'll contact you. Okay, kind of straightforward like my response was sent.

461
00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.049
> P7: and I should receive a pie within 7 business days.

462
00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:04.922
> P7: No, it's gonna wonder why it takes so long. But okay.

463
00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:12.803
> P7: well, I'm just gonna go to Google and research the question myself. Cause 7 days is 7 business days, like, Okay.

464
00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:13.820
Tyler: Yeah.

465
00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.530
> P7: By then, I'll just, you know, do

466
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.749
> P7: hopefully find the answer myself. I'll take maybe 1530 min, but

467
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.370
> P7: hopefully I'll find my answer myself by then

468
00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:25.300
> P7: kind of waiting that long.

469
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:26.430
Tyler: Yeah.

470
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:33.550
Tyler: yeah. So kind of maybe weren't expecting it to take as long as it is, it's saying that it will. And

471
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:39.349
Tyler: how like, how are they gonna get back in touch with you after those 7 business days? Is that clear.

472
00:35:40.267 --> 00:35:50.050
> P7: No. So I'm I'm thinking they're just gonna reply on here. I'm gonna have to log in to ask Va. And and like check to see if

473
00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.834
> P7: they've answered the question. I think,

474
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:57.140
> P7: now that you mentioned that it would be nice if

475
00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.260
> P7: if they

476
00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:06.390
> P7: would notify me through email that I got a response to my question or something, you know, or something like that.

477
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.229
> P7: instead of me having to go back log in. And

478
00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:11.059
> P7: you know, because

479
00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.630
> P7: it says they're gonna reply within 7 days. But I don't. And then they're not letting me, if they're

480
00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:22.079
> P7: know if they're gonna notify me that, they replied, and some this is makes me think I'm gonna have to check every day

481
00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:25.980
> P7: to see when my reply has been sent.

482
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:31.009
Tyler: Yeah, that's a great point, like you might know where to find your reply, because you.

483
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.340
> P7: Of just.

484
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:36.529
Tyler: Been in this tool, but you wouldn't know necessarily when to check back.

485
00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.010
> P7: Yeah.

486
00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.460
Tyler: Reply.

487
00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.669
> P7: Do I have to check every day? Do you have to check every you know.

488
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.000
> P7: twice a day, you know. So.

489
00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.160
Tyler: Yeah.

490
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.509
Tyler: for sure. Is there any other information that's missing from this page?

491
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:53.840
Tyler: So that's.

492
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.890
> P7: That's very interesting.

493
00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:07.257
> P7: Not that I can think of.

494
00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:09.640
Tyler: So

495
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:15.629
Tyler: how would you get back to the askba like homepage like where we started from? Here?

496
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.110
> P7: Oh.

497
00:37:17.562 --> 00:37:20.720
> P7: well, well, I guess I would like, since it was a solve question.

498
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:26.760
> P7: I'm still unsure. You know, this is gonna really get to anyone, so maybe

499
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:29.810
> P7: I would like it. Say, like.

500
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:32.090
> P7: you know your quest, your

501
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:35.439
> P7: this question was reopened, or something, you know.

502
00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:40.050
> P7: That way to verify in order to reassure me, like, Okay.

503
00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:41.700
> P7: we know it was solved.

504
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:44.390
> P7: and you just reopened it instead of like.

505
00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:48.830
> P7: is it really? It says, solved, is it really gonna get to anyone like.

506
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:49.990
> P7: yeah.

507
00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:51.800
Tyler: Yeah.

508
00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.220
> P7: So yeah, I'm not sure, like.

509
00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:59.889
> P7: just like we were unsure from before from the page prior this response, and I'm still not

510
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.115
> P7: sure.

511
00:38:02.462 --> 00:38:06.710
Tyler: Yeah, so especially because it's already been solved.

512
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:07.150
> P7: Yeah.

513
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:09.050
Tyler: You need a little bit of reassurance. Yeah.

514
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:22.839
> P7: Yeah, exactly. So. What I would do next is I would go back to that one page where it says, new reopen or solve, and I would check to see did it change that the status change, you know. Maybe like that's what I guess. What is missing is a status change on there.

515
00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:23.940
Tyler: Thanks.

516
00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.070
Tyler: yeah, let's go back and do that. How would we get there.

517
00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:29.360
> P7: Yeah, so I would click on

518
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.340
> P7: the benefit of healthcare. No, about va no

519
00:38:35.145 --> 00:38:43.034
> P7: so my my 1st instance to go up to the tabs. But none of this helps, so that then this home contact us ask questions.

520
00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:44.930
> P7: and I would look at that.

521
00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.790
> P7: plus, I guess I would

522
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.189
> P7: click on. I don't want ask question. Ask Va.

523
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.219
> P7: I guess I would go to home.

524
00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.470
Tyler: Okay.

525
00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:56.970
> P7: On that link right there.

526
00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:57.370
Tyler: Yeah.

527
00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:58.189
> P7: The arrow.

528
00:38:58.190 --> 00:38:58.870
Tyler: Yeah.

529
00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:02.897
Tyler: yeah, up at the top. Here, I see that that makes sense.

530
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.250
Tyler: we're actually gonna click on. Ask BA,

531
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.479
Tyler: which is this one here.

532
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:14.809
Tyler: and I'm curious like, what made you feel like we shouldn't click on. Ask Va. And instead, we should click on home.

533
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.589
Tyler: If you can describe that.

534
00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.316
> P7: Oh, cause that just feels like I'm I'm gonna

535
00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:25.349
> P7: I take it, just feels like it's gonna take me back to the page I was before this one.

536
00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:25.870
Tyler: Hmm,

537
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:32.420
> P7: Because I I kind of feel like question sent is where I'm at right now, as fear would be like

538
00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:33.940
> P7: the last.

539
00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.480
> P7: The last page I was on. That's what it that that makes me feel like.

540
00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:41.619
Tyler: Right? I totally see that that makes sense.

541
00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:43.109
Tyler: Okay, well, let's click.

542
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:44.340
Tyler: Oh, go ahead.

543
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:48.520
> P7: I'm not sure what contact us was, or, Yeah.

544
00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.770
Tyler: But that makes sense. You're going like one step back.

545
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:52.170
> P7: Yeah.

546
00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:56.419
Tyler: Thinking, okay, that's not. That's not the one I want, and it's not contact us. So I guess home.

547
00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:57.320
> P7: Yes.

548
00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:03.099
Tyler: Yeah, cool. Okay? Well, let's click on Sva. And then let's go ahead and have a look around like you said.

549
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:12.470
> P7: Okay. Now I see that my question was reopened.

550
00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.960
> P7: That answers that is reopen. So okay, so I'm like good. It was reopened. So

551
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:24.370
> P7: kind of what gives you more reassurance that they're gonna respond to give me a response back.

552
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.950
Tyler: Yeah.

553
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:32.407
Tyler: that makes sense. So that totally met your kind of like your hope, which was that it would be reopen

554
00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:36.300
Tyler: why has the order of the questions shifted.

555
00:40:37.043 --> 00:40:41.740
> P7: Just shift to be from, I guess last, whatever was updated, the last the.

556
00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:42.705
> P7: Or

557
00:40:43.410 --> 00:40:44.090
> P7: yeah.

558
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:46.750
> P7: And that's

559
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:48.119
> P7: what that's showing me.

560
00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:50.950
Tyler: yeah.

561
00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:53.182
Tyler: that makes sense.

562
00:40:54.080 --> 00:41:00.599
Tyler: we've kind of reached the end of my questions, about these screens is there, anything else you want to share with me while we're still looking at this.

563
00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:04.889
> P7: No, not not off the top of my head.

564
00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.080
Tyler: Okay?

565
00:41:06.433 --> 00:41:09.699
Tyler: Well, we've got a couple of minutes left, so I'll stop sharing my screen.

566
00:41:10.095 --> 00:41:14.759
Tyler: And we can just spend the last couple of minutes kind of like reflecting on what we just did.

567
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:19.330
Tyler: so overall. What do you think of that process?

568
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:29.879
> P7: The process. I mean, so soon as I've I asked my 1st question, and I see it takes 7 days to to answer my questions like, this is not

569
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:31.370
> P7: very use.

570
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:38.000
> P7: Yeah. I'm better off doing Google search for an hour by myself.

571
00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:51.209
> P7: And then if I finally that that asked Va. Would be my last resource. I would phone a friend, you know. I'd I'd probably dial the Va. And try to get an operator, maybe to answer my questions. It would be

572
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:56.800
> P7: 7 days way too long, like, why bother like? If, as in a

573
00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:03.599
> P7: knowing that I have to log into the Va. Just the process of logging in, and how long that takes with

574
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:20.009
> P7: them, constantly asking me to change my my create a new password. You know what I mean, for for first, st the power password so long that I have it written on my notes somewhere. I have to open up my notes, copy and paste my password, hope, hope that they're not asking me to

575
00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:35.870
> P7: create a new password because it's been, I don't know. Like 2 days since my last password user, any of my Google Google authentication go on there, put my Google authentication because I just and then and then they're gonna like, and then they're gonna ask me to put my

576
00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:38.906
> P7: my text PIN authentication. After that

577
00:42:39.540 --> 00:42:42.310
> P7: I did all that. Just ask it quite, you know, just.

578
00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.880
> P7: And fumble through the website again. Ask a question.

579
00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.759
> P7: and then wait 7 days.

580
00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.370
> P7: Right, you know, for the transfer back.

581
00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:51.220
Tyler: Great.

582
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:56.279
> P7: And then not even not even get a email notification that all your answer question was answered. So

583
00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:01.409
> P7: have to breed. Do that, pat that process all over again, just to check to see

584
00:43:01.450 --> 00:43:04.200
> P7: if they answer my question. You know.

585
00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:04.650
Tyler: Right.

586
00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.289
> P7: I'm not. I'm not gonna do all that.

587
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.190
Tyler: Yeah.

588
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:21.009
Tyler: yeah, that does. When you describe it. It does sound pretty long winded. Do you feel like you didn't really know how long it was gonna take like that. It would be like 7 business days until we got to that that kind of last screen.

589
00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:25.399
> P7: No, I didn't. No, I thought it was gonna be more I was hoping maybe

590
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:29.679
> P7: someone sitting on the other end like ready to answer the question. Maybe

591
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:45.229
> P7: take 5 min to answer it, or hopefully, maybe even like AI. Now with, you know, with all chat Gpt how that answers your question. You go on Google now, it's AI, you know. It's just way faster to ask Google at this point, or even chat gpt

592
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:55.049
> P7: like. Or you know if I wasn't I was less technically savvy. I'd just call Fran, or just call the Va. Number. And hopefully they answer my question for me.

593
00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:56.030
Tyler: Yeah.

594
00:43:56.610 --> 00:44:00.149
Tyler: Yeah. So your expectation was like that. You might get

595
00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:12.479
Tyler: either an immediate response or like a couple of minutes later. But but more like, you know, in that session you would have a reply, which is not the case. Yeah. And it sounds like you'd even prefer

596
00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:21.949
Tyler: like, let's say a less personal response like you might Google or use Chat Gbt, or whatever. If it means, you can get your reply sooner right.

597
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:22.900
> P7: Correct.

598
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:23.680
Tyler: Yeah.

599
00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:26.342
Tyler: that totally makes sense.

600
00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:32.670
Tyler: is there anything about the process that you liked like anything you'd want to keep? Or

601
00:44:33.910 --> 00:44:35.709
Tyler: You thought was working.

602
00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.700
> P7: I like. I like the once I knew what the boxes were.

603
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.350
> P7: I like that.

604
00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:44.840
> P7: not sure what it would look like if

605
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:47.090
> P7: I guess.

606
00:44:47.310 --> 00:45:00.319
> P7: Well, I guess when I would 1st log in, and then there'd be no questions answer or boxes, questions asked or boxes, so I would click on, ask a question. I would ask it. Then go back to the home screen. I would see that

607
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.266
> P7: I would assume I see the box pop up with my question. So I like that that it says,

608
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.100
> P7: you know the category. And then

609
00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:21.390
> P7: the question verbatim, how I asked it on there and then, you know. I think the status we covered that that was a little confusing. I would assume you meant that. I just asked. You know

610
00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:24.090
> P7: that I just asked the question, so I would see that.

611
00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:30.840
> P7: And so I I like the the questions were there for me to revisit, and

612
00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:32.050
> P7: you know

613
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.949
> P7: that there were on the homepage as well that, you know.

614
00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:37.930
> P7: and I have to search for the questions I had had asked.

615
00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.039
> P7: Right? I like that part. Yeah.

616
00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.190
Tyler: Yeah. So are you liking like

617
00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.380
Tyler: that? It's kind of it's easy to.

618
00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:44.960
> P7: In, the.

619
00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.790
Tyler: Question, exactly.

620
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:52.560
> P7: Exactly easy. Find them. I don't have to click another link to open another page to see my questions that I have asked.

621
00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:59.900
> P7: Already right on the main screen. So like, ask any question or revisit the old ones like that's that's what I'm there for, you. And I mean.

622
00:46:00.213 --> 00:46:11.190
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And it, you also called out, how you like that it has your question, verbatim easy for you to to read and help you kind of find old questions. Yeah.

623
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:11.870
> P7: Yeah.

624
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.610
Tyler: Awesome.

625
00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:22.680
Tyler: That makes sense. I think you've answered all my questions that was really really helpful. I do want to leave a little bit of time in case you have any questions for me.

626
00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.260
> P7: No.

627
00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.700
Tyler: No? Okay.

628
00:46:27.332 --> 00:46:37.860
Tyler: Well, I know it's your. This is your 1st time taking part in research at the Va we really really appreciate your feedback. We've got loads of notes that we're gonna go back through and

629
00:46:38.139 --> 00:46:56.180
Tyler: I know we've learned a lot in in the hour with you. So I appreciate it. The next step is the folks who set up this research session from Paragien they're gonna send you an email. And it's gonna have a thank you. Note and information, you could pass on to other veterans in case they want to to do this in the future.

630
00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:03.749
Tyler: but yeah, and if you have questions you can reach out to them. I think that's everything else for me, though.

631
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.990
> P7: Okay.

632
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:07.940
Tyler: Awesome. Well, thanks so much for your time.

633
00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:08.870
> P7: Okay, thank, you, yeah.

634
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:09.779
Tyler: Have a good day.

635
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:10.870
Khoa N.: Thank you. Jeff.

636
00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:12.120
e.a.: Thank you. Aye.

637
00:47:12.446 --> 00:47:13.100

Tyler: Bye, thanks.
