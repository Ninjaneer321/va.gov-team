### Warm up

Tyler: I'm gonna start the recording and then I'm just gonna confirm one more time. Just to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P10: I am.

Tyler: Awesome. Do you have any questions for me?

> P10: No.

Tyler: Are those birds on your side?

> P10: Yes, do you need me to shoo them away? Can you hear them?

Tyler: No, no, I was just curious. Yeah, are they outside of your house or you have birds inside?

> P10: No, I have a parakeet sitting about 2 feet away from me.

Tyler: Oh. Wow. Oh cool! Wow, so pretty.

> P10: There's 1 of them. Good morning. And there's And there's 4 more.

> P10: You can go upstairs.

> P10: Well, if they get to be too loud, you just say so and I'll shoot them to another room.

Tyler: Awesome. Okay. So, [P10], I think you're a school certifying official, right?

> P10: I am.

Tyler: So do you want to tell me a little bit about like your role and kind of what's involved, what you do day to day?

> P10: We only have an hour though. Lol.

> P10: Yeah, so I am the main point of contact at the school for students who are using any type of VA education benefits. So I've been [involved] with  chapter 33. I work with current serving members. [My state] has a large national guard population. So that's a large part of my caseload. I also work with students using chapter 31 VR&E benefits. And I'm also a work study supervisor.

> P10: They are the front face of our Veterans Center on campus. So, I've been with [school] for just over 8 years, almost 20 years [in this type of role].

Tyler: Okay, awesome. So, very cool. You have like a kind of range of experience and in this case like school certifying official hat and then work  study supervisor. I think that'll be really helpful. And you also help with the RNE. I think all those things will be helpful.

> P10: Yeah, so my formal role is actually I'm an academic advisor. So I'm like the person for these students. We're not, we're trying to do it all in one office for benefits, advising, graduation planning. I know just enough about FAFSA and financial pieces to be dangerous. So rather than having them stop around for answers. I'm kind of just their person.

Tyler: Awesome. And then tell me a little bit about how you use Ask VA or AVA or however you call it. In your role.

> P10: Sure. I try not to use [Ask VA] because I try to do everything that VA has instructed us. With regard to policy, process, reporting enrollment information. So it's really kind of my last go-to, when it comes to at least the education benefits piece.

> P10: I just recently had to use it because stuff didn't make sense. So the term had ended. I had reported some reductions in credits for non-punitive grades. I reported some academic suspensions, but then VA had actually turned around and you gave us more money. So when things don't make sense when normal business processes are just like... But, it's our main ticket system to contact VA to express a concern specific to a student, aka, a file that we're working on, and get help that way.

> P10: For VA work study, it's like this, it is the sole way that we're communicating information to VA. So it is providing scanned attachments, so PDFs of documents that students are doing. So that process is really still heavily paper based from the application, the contracts, the the time sheets, everything is scanned. And submitted as a ticket to VA through Ask VA. And then we're getting responses back that way.

> P10: So those are really the 2 main buckets for which I have to use [Ask VA].

Tyler: Okay, that's really helpful. So like on the one hand, like not work study stuff, you're trying almost as little as possible to use it unless it's like some outstanding case, something's not making sense or it's like complex.

> P10: Correct.

Tyler: And then for work study, it's obviously like a lot of paperwork uploading and things like that.

> P10: Yes.

Tyler: Awesome. That's, that's super helpful. Is that how you would get in touch with the VA in general then? Like if you need to, do you ever call them?

> P10: Yeah, so yeah, to be fair, the SCO hotline would be my other option for contacting the VA with, you know, business specific things that don't make sense. I need a piece of information that a student didn't provide or didn't know. But for the ones that I dealt with recently, a really complex situations that I feel like I would rather have a paper trail for it. That's the way to type it out and and get that information and get it in writing and have something tangible to put back in the students file.

> P10: Easy stuff that I would go to the phone first rather than, I skipped calling the VA on these complex like wrong payment type things and I went right to AVA for this.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that's really interesting. And then when you're talking about like that wanting it to be like trackable and like make sure that you have it like documented so that you can put it in the students case file so are you like printing out what you're putting in there, how does that work?

> P10: Printing to paper? No. Digitally printing. Yes, so we have everything is digital document management system. So I can pull something up in Ask VA digitally printed directly to a student's office record at the school.

Tyler: Yeah. How do you do that? Like, can you describe to me exactly how you're putting it in that file?

> P10: Yeah, this is where AVA isn't great because like if I have a multi-layer conversation going on a case, there's not a good way to open it all so I would actually have to cut and paste like, here's what I originally sent. Here's what the 1st response was. I would actually pull that out piece by piece, put it in the Word document. And then we have an image, what's called our image now printer, spatially screen scraping and then putting it directly into the student's file.

Tyler: Got it. Okay, that's super helpful. So what you ideally want is to be able to see like that conversation. Maybe, like, in what order would that be?

> P10: Ideally. Original response and then the chain under it. I mean in this day and age we're so used to emails being the oldest is at the bottom and then it builds up. That would be okay too. But I would rather it be and feel more like an email where I'm seeing the entire conversation and one thing rather than clicking through piece by piece.

Tyler: For sure, that makes sense. Yeah, I mean that whole added step of like pulling everything into a Word document and all of that.

> P10: It's clunky.

Tyler: Seems like, yeah, for sure. How many, like how often are you submitting inquiries? Maybe like setting aside work study for a moment.

> P10: I think I even had it open earlier. Should I look? You wanna, or do you want me to guess? Oh, maybe it closed on me.

Tyler: Yeah, if you have it open, if not, no worries.

> P10: I still have it, it's kicked me out. Well, this is where I even felt funny because when xx had asked for volunteers, I'm like, I don't use it that much. So maybe I'm not the right person, but.

Tyler: That's okay.

> P10: No, it kicked me out.

Tyler: Okay, so you're not using it that much for like general questions and stuff, but then for work study, like do you have work study students at the moment that you would be submitting like kind of on a regular basis?

> P10: I don't have any in the summer, but you know, thinking about spring semester. So, there's a chunks that has to happen before the semester starts. So applications. Brand new contract for contract extensions. Time sheets can be submitted every 2 weeks.

> P10: That's what VA asks us to do. And then, so that's kind of constant throughout the semester. And then kind of we'll start the process again prior to fall semester. I'll be hiring again. I'll have one returning. I'll be hiring at least 2 more. So sending applications, getting contracts back. Kind of cyclical. For a bigger school it would be more volume but I keep it pretty simple here.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. That still sounds like a fair amount of like experience with going in, uploading your files and all that sort of stuff.

Tyler: Are you usually doing this all on your computer, would you ever use, Ask VA on your phone?

> P10: I don't think so.

Tyler: Okay. Okay, that makes sense. And I just wanna clarify as well, are you also a Veteran yourself?

> P10: I am not.

Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, we're gonna talk a little bit more about all that kind of background, but I think we should get set up with this prototype.

Tyler: So I'm gonna send you a link in this, chat on zoom. And I'll send it just now.

Tyler: And then once you have that on your end, if you can just open that up and let me know once it's loaded.

> P10: Oh, sorry. So many windows open. It's thinking.

Tyler: Okay. Yeah, it might take a minute to load.

> P10: Okay, it looks like itself. Oh, it's pretty. It looks like the other sites.

Tyler: Awesome. So now we can see that it looks kind of familiar. Why don't we, we're gonna have you share your screen on zoom if that's okay.

> P10: Yep.

Tyler: Have you done that recently? Okay. I'll give you a minute to do that. Perfect.

Tyler: It looks like I can see your screen now. So it says Ask VA. And the 1st thing you noticed was you said it looks like the other sites.

### Dashboard

> P10: Yeah, like this heading. I'm familiar with it.

Tyler: And you're talking about other VA sites that you've used before?

> P10: Yeah.

Tyler: Okay, awesome.

Tyler: So for this session, we're gonna pretend like you're signed into your account. So it says up at the top it says Jordan, we're gonna pretend like that says [P10].

> P10: I'm Jordan. For the day. Yep.

Tyler: Yeah, yeah, or your Jordan. And these are, like you've just signed in to Ask VA.

Tyler: So this is, you know, post sign in. And this is where you land. So we're not going to click on anything yet but you're totally welcome to scroll around and I'd love for you to just start by telling me what you're noticing.

> P10: Well, like I said, the 1st thing is it's mirroring the look and feel of other places that I would navigate on VA. So I know it's legit.

> P10: I like this. The newest to oldest.

> P10: For myself, when I log in it 1st goes to personal and I'm looking at 2 things that I accidentally submitted as personal.

> P10: Is this grayed out or is it actually functional? Like I could switch to personal?

Tyler: You can, yeah, you can click on that.
 
> P10: I'm clicking on personal. Okay, so it's pretty easy to switch. Business.

> P10: I mean, this looks more up to date, modern. I'm getting more used to things being shown at what do we call these cards?

Tyler: Yeah.

> P10: Cards as opposed to like just a long list of of things.

Tyler: Is that because, like when you say you're getting more used to it because you've seen it on VA websites or just like in this moment you're getting used to it?

> P10: No, I think in general the software tools that I'm using, even like our, the overhaul of our college website is and like our the advising tool that we're using is no longer showing things in long lists. It's the card concept is becoming just more commonplace and I'm getting used to it and maybe even expecting things to show that way.

Tyler: Okay.

> P10: I like that I can see when it was submitted, who it was about.

> P10: I have Ask VA up on the other screen too, so I'm kind of doing a comparison of what I'm seeing.

Tyler: Awesome.

> P10: But yeah, the card. I'm on my computer all day long so this is not like overwhelming to me like it's intuitive I would know what to do and how to navigate this.

Tyler: Yeah. Okay, awesome. Yeah, that was really helpful just hearing you like narrate things you're seeing.

Tyler: So you notice like newest to oldest. We talked about the tabs and how, you know, usually you're seeing your personal tab 1st here, you're seeing your business tab first.

Tyler: And then let's look a little more closely at one of these cards. So if you could just like go through the card and tell me like what these different pieces of information are.

> P10: Yeah, so I would.

> P10: I would venture a guess that the [label] the top where says education and work study would have been things that I would have had to like select when I was submitting it, kind of like I do now there's like drop-down categorical like main subject overall subject. I suspect it's pre populated obviously.

> P10: This is probably like a subject line that Jordan would have typed. Yeah, and this looks like it was just submitted. It's still I would assume open being a smart new and no one has taken action on it.

> P10: And I would suspect that if I check details, I can see. Other items that I would have typed in there or the attachments that I set with it.

> P10: Did I get right?

Tyler: Okay. Yeah, I mean, there's no, again, we're not testing you. I think that makes a lot of sense.

Tyler: Let's talk, so we talked about that 1st label, education benefits and you're remembering like when you usually submit, you have to choose like a category and that's probably what that is.

Tyler: That makes sense. And then the date you said this is auto populated, which also makes sense. What date do you think that would be like that big old date? What is that referring to?

> P10: [Date at the top is] when it was submitted. But a little bit of a question mark. Sure, yes, a little bit of a question mark because then there's multiple dates shown elsewhere.

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And then this next part you, this is like time card attached, Calum Scott. You were like, maybe this is the subject of like what I submitted. Which makes sense.

> P10: Yes.

Tyler: When you submit time cards or any kind of like work study, things. How do you use those fields? Like you've got the subject, you've got the question, like how do you personally fill them out? Would it look similar to this or would it be a little bit different? Like do you use the student's name?

> P10: Yes, for my own tracking purposes, I would put at least their last name, in part of the subject. I mean, for submitting a time sheet, it's pretty quick, cause it's just like last name. I might include or the word like timesheet or time card. I might put like the month and date on there just for my own purposes. So I know when I'm submitting it. For non work study things. I mean, I'm typing out a paragraph or 2 like full sentences.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So that's.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Again, I'm looking back to. The existing AVA and I have I have a paragraph I have a chunk showing up as the entire question.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Okay.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
That makes sense.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
In a list. Okay. And so as I'm talking, I'm like, why is there a lot of light space right there?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Yeah, so you're kind of like expecting there to be a bit more information.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
In your inquiry. Like in the way you would use that. Yeah, that makes sense.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Little bit. Can, can I go to the next page? Maybe there's another version of it.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
There you won't actually be able to click to the next page. Yeah.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Okay, so these are these are my 4 examples. Okay.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Yeah, these are your 4 examples for today, but that's really helpful. I mean, obviously everyone who's submitting works study, like paperwork and things like that.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Might have a different like. vernacular or whatever, a different way of like describing their inquiry.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Yep.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:59.000
So that's helpful to think about and your it sounds like your hope or what you'd expect is that if your inquiry was a bit longer, that would still be showing up in this.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
That kind of white space.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000
You know, so long, so long as I had enough information to know which one I was submitting.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Again, I don't know if. The last few that I submitted, I mean, I did.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:26.000
I typed a good chunk and provided a whole bunch of data in a box. But a subject line to go back and find it would have been sufficient can I show you my like Can I actually pull this over?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Yeah, of course.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
It has like It has last 4 of social and like names. Is that okay?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Yeah, that should be fine.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Okay, so this is what I'd be comparing it to when I had to go back and look for what I spent the like.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Yeah. Right.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
That's a whole big dunk of information. And like to go back and find it, I really would have just needed to know.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Who it was. That I was following.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Okay, so the main thing. Is the main thing you're looking for like you're looking at all these inquiries you're trying to remember which one to look for the main thing is the student's name

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Yep. Yes, that.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Yeah. Yeah. But that makes sense. I think, right, right.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000
That feels like pointing out the obvious, but yes, I would need to know. I would need to know who I was asking about.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And for us, Like that's why we need to have conversations with folks like yourself. Cause like it's less obvious to us, but that makes sense now talking to you.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000
You obviously are associating like. This submission with this student and their file. So. That makes sense.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Is there, are you ever using, the like the reference number that you get with each inquiry?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
No. Okay.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:43.000
I don't think so. I feel like it's just a tracking mechanism. I don't.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I treat my students with their name rather than trying to find the reference number. I mean, I know that's what we get back in like the email.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
But I, I would disregard it and go more to the, the text that I typed out. And who it is, then the number.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that. And

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Oh look, the number is not on here.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Yes, the number is not on here. We weren't really sure how people are using that number.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:11.000
So that's another thing we've been wanting to learn about. So that makes sense why you're not using it and you're actually using the student name.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Yes.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Going back to the emails so you're getting these emails like you submit your inquiry you get an email you get, you know, you get a reply, you get an email, or how are you using those emails?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
If at all. Yeah. Yeah.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000
I deleted it. I mean the 1st one that's simply like Thanks for your submission. It immediately goes in the trash.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Yeah.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Yeah.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Like, I know, like, I'm just waiting. The next one. Would be like, hey, we answered it.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And I will probably just leave that email sit there until I have a time, like time in my day that I can go in and check it and follow up on it.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
But I really don't read it because there's no information in it other than we answered it.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Right. It's more like a notification.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Which is helpful rather than Just having to occasionally loss back into the system to see if it's been done.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
But it's not, there's no content in the email that I need.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Right. Yeah, that makes sense. And then when you're so like you get an email, it says you have a response you go into ask the A and you look for the response.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Yes.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:29.000
What like why this might sound obvious but like what are you looking for from them like especially for these work study applications like What are they what do you need back from the VI?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Oh, so for a VA work study application. In general, it's simply a canned message of like, we got this, we added it to a processing queue.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
That's what I want to see. In

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Shall we say rare cases? We messed up on the math, right? Like we miscalculated something, we counted hours wrong and the VA would tell us that.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And say, hey, can you check your math and then resubmit it? Those are like the 2 main things that I would be looking for after a time part has been submitted.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Okay.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
But like, 94% of the time it's simply like we got it and we're about to process it.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Okay, and are you still like going back and looking at that or you like it's probably gonna have like do you still need to look at it for peace of mind that it has been?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Sorted? Okay.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.000
I do. It takes it takes a few, I mean it takes longer to log into the system. That it does actually read that message and be like, yep, good.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Right. Yeah. Okay.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
But I do check. Because if I don't, I will miss that one. That has some other information.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Totally.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Like a miscalculation and then 2 weeks later my work study will be like Did you send my thing in?

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Right.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I haven't gotten it. So yes, it's just part of my normal process to actually read it.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Yeah, that makes sense. Awesome. Okay, so coming back to this screen we're looking at now.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000
We've got like these 4 inquiries in here. Which one of these, if any of them, do you feel like has a reply from the VA?

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Yet.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Well, the one down here that's solved would indicate that something has come back from the VA.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
This one, I'm not exactly sure what in progress means.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Okay, yeah.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
And then, so we've got solved, which probably has the reply from the VA in progress is not feeling clear.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And then we've got new. What do you think new means?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
That Jordan would have just recently submitted it and is waiting on an answer, likely hasn't.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Okay. Okay.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Okay.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Then red yet sitting in someone's queue waiting to be looked at. That's that's why I'm struggling with this like we're used to just like Open and closed kind of like open versus solved in the current system I think is the language.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
I don't think we have a a parallel to what in progress would mean.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Okay, that makes sense. And like the maybe the similarity between new and in progress is confusing or like.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
They're too similar, potentially.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Well, by date, like I would know that.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:23.000
There's a difference between the new and in progress, but. It's not. Clear why it's in progress.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Okay, yeah. That makes a lot of sense. And then we've got like,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:51.000
We have this last updated date. So what does that mean? What does that mean last updated?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Hmm.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
I would assume that means It's kinda like an email timestamp like this is the last state that someone sent information one way or the other.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Okay, so any update either from your cell or from the VA. Yeah. Huh.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Right, so for let's say this 1st one where it's hanging out May, the 17th it's marked as new the last update I would assume this is when the shall we say the ticket was created the case was created same with this one.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:22.000
I would, I would. Venture a guest that solves me and said this was the last time that the that the VA.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Added information to this ticket.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Right, okay, that makes sense.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Okay, awesome. And then If you, like right when we got to this page, you were like, oh, I like how I can sort this by newest to oldest.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Yes.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
What do you like about that?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:48.000
It was just kind of front and center intuitive. I honestly don't know if I can sort in the other system.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Yeah.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
How would you like? Okay.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:04.000
I'm I mean for email I'm used to having This this ability to do this to look for something.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
So I, I would expect it on a system like this.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Yeah, okay. So it's kinda like meeting your expectation, you know how to use it. Yeah.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Yes.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000
That makes sense.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
I'm assuming there's just 2 in here.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
You can go ahead and say, yeah, you won't be able to choose them, but you can only see the menu.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Okay.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:34.000
So that's obviously one way of like sorting this information. And we talked about how another way that you would be like.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Yes.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Maybe skimming is based on like the student name. I guess like I'm cognizant that especially for y'all like business submitters.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Right. Let's do.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Inquiries can look very similar to one another like they can all be like educate they can all say education they can all say students names.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
So how how are you able to quickly like find the one you're looking for?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
In here.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Oh.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Yeah, or even just how you're doing it right now, if that is an easier starting point.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Oh, good question. Right now in the current AVA dashboard, it's simply scrolling through a list.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Okay.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
And kind of looking for a keyword that pops out. So for the last few debt inquiries, you know, I would be looking for the students name.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Okay.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Say with work study like because I know that I put a name in it I would just be scrolling a list through it.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:48.000
And for my own personal, like as we've mentioned before, like I don't have the same volume that a larger school might happen this so it's fairly easy for me to find something.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000
That makes sense. I think that just goes back to like how important being able to find the student name is for you.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So that makes sense.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Okay.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.000
I don't have my list to my dashboard isn't like so crazy populated that I would have to like control F on something or you know use an internal search to to find what I'm looking for I can find it fairly quickly as is.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Okay, cool. That makes sense. Awesome.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
So we talked a lot about this page, but I kind of wanted to talk about the next step in this process.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000
So now we've figured out and which inquiry we want to look at. So let's say we want to look at this inquiry you submitted on May 8.th

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And we want to see what the VA replied. So go ahead and show me how we do that.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Yep.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
I can see your mouse quickly went to this link.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Yeah, I would go into the check details section and click on that and see what comes up.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Okay.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
And then talk to me about what we're seeing here.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000
It looks like, what I would have submitted originally, pops up 1st at the top of the page.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:03.000
It looks like the only data that I actually typed into the question kind of like what I would do now for my own process is indicate that I'm sending a signed contract for my student name.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:13.000
To Thomas Brown, I can see the attachment that I provided to the VA. And then. The details section.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000
I assume I just pre populated things that came out of that ticket submission. It tells me when it was sent.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:31.000
It's telling me that it was solved, the reference number that again we talked about isn't necessarily helpful but understanding it's for tracking purposes.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Oh, I had to scroll down to the bottom. Hmm, wait, what? So there's a section where I could actually reply.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Again to it? And provide an additional attachment. In the middle before I get down to see what the VA sent.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Okay.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000
So something's feeling off.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Does my face say at all? I mean.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Yeah, that feels out of order.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Yeah, I can see that.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
You're expecting to see maybe their reply next.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Cause Yep. Like where did it go? I was honestly like before I scroll I'm like.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Totally.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Did they write back? Like this is all I can see, right? I can see my own question information and then send reply and like, wait, did they write back?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
They did right back. It's just farther down the page.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Right. That makes sense. So like that would be when we talked about this a little earlier too, like it's important for you to be able to see that like.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Yes.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
It does.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Trail of conversation so this is feels like a weird order and a little harder to follow because of that that makes sense.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
One thing I'm kind of curious about is,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.000
We again, we talked about this earlier, but right now we're seeing like your question and then we're seeing their reply.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Yep.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Does that feel like the right order? Like you want to see your question, their reply. And then maybe like if you replied back to them, would that come next?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000
So it would go kind of like chronologically down the page.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Yeah, yes, I like that.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:29.000
And when we went when we talked about printing earlier, like right now it's a little bit of a struggle in terms of like having to pull everything into a Word document, not a struggle, but it's more work.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
How would you like think about printing a page like this?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Do you still have to do the Word document?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And I tried.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Well this you can of course. This will work a little differently since it's not technically a website.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Oh.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
So that'll look a little. Yeah, that'll look a little wonky, but. Helpful to know that like did you just do control P?

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Okay.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:08.000
I did. And image now printer would be like our screens great potential to do that. I mean, I could attempt to save it as a PDF.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Yeah.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:16.000
I'm afraid. Just like any website, I'm not sure that it would print nicely onto pages.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:25.000
As is. I mean, if I could put a wish list, it'd be like, export this to a nicely formatted PDF without.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Yeah.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
You know, all the gobbly cook.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Yeah, that makes sense. So, one like, I guess symptom of this being a prototype is how funny it looked when you tried to print it but put potentially it would be a little bit like more normal looking if you did control P.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Yes.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:55.000
If you did that so you were gonna go print this conversation. The conversation was in the order that we talked about that you would prefer.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Is there any information on this? Page that's missing that you need on the

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:22.000
I don't think so. I mean, it's It's pretty commonplace to not, you know, have a name or specific contact information.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:30.000
On like who would have worked this ticket from VA. So I guess like this, this is what I would expect to see in a response from VA.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Yes.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Okay. Okay. And then sometimes when the VA responds to you, they're sending you attachments.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Is that right?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Or not so much.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Okay.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:51.000
For work study, not so much, we end up getting an encrypted email with the attachments rather than pulling an attachment out of the system.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Oh, okay. That's helpful. And then when you get those. Attachments in the encrypted email, do you then put them in the students file?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Got it.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Those are those would be things that like actually need to be. Printed signs and then returned. So no, not printing them to the file.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Okay, got it. Alright.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
They're transmitting that blank time sheet and the pre populated contract that a student would actually need to read.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Signed date and then we would turn it back in.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Okay, gotcha. That makes a lot of sense. So.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Yes.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
I know there's also like information you would submit about your school when you're when you're putting in this SBA inquiry, like you would have to have like a school associated with your.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Submission and that's not on here like would you need that information or it's like no because I'm always for this one school so I wouldn't need to have that one here.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Does that make sense?

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000
It does. For me that makes sense. I am one school one campus like easy PC, right?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Yeah.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
I have I have colleagues in Minnesota. They're actually an SEO for 2 different schools.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Okay.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Right.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
So I could see where they would want to be able to. Have that information associated with. I mean, obviously they they could by the student associated back to which school or campus it was for, but.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Right.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:33.000
I could see what yes, that would be like a helpful standard thing. If all of my tickets came back with Norman Dale Community College on it, I would think nothing of it because for me, it's obvious, but I.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
I'm channeling my colleagues who cover multiple schools. Multiple campuses. Yes.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Yeah, no, that's helpful. That makes sense. I can see how like. It's not really necessary in your case, but it could be for somebody else and also just goes back to like the importance of the students name.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Yes.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:36:02.000
So do you feel like just kinda like, this is maybe an opinion question, do you think most SEOs, or work study folks would be putting in the students name in there.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Yes.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
In that question box. Okay, yeah. I'm kinda getting that sense that that would be like super necessary.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Your brain might be going here already, but as we talked about. We're on the subject of like facility code school name.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
To be able to have that as a sorting feature too on that previous page. For schools that do have multiple coverage, that would be great.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Hmm. Yeah, I could totally see that. That makes sense.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Awesome. I am just thinking if I have any other questions on this page for you or is there anything else that you notice you want to point out to me?

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Is this something that's functional? You expand all things.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Like collapsible.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000
It won't work right now, but yeah. In theory, it would.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
So as it's built, like would this just build on? Down the page.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Yeah, good question. So you mean like if you sent a reply back and they replied back to you again, would it kind of keep adding?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Yes.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Yeah, I think that makes sense to me. And you'd expect it to kind of go down the page.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Like would their next reply be underneath or would that be above? Does that make sense?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000
The way that it's built now, it's built. Oldest to newest so I kind of expect it to go down the page.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Okay. Awesome. I think we've like talked through a lot of my questions on the dashboard and I kind of wanna just go rogue for a minute and ask you some questions about the form.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Sure. I'm up for that.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
If you're up for that. Okay, cool. Well, you can stop sharing your screen, if you like.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Okay.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000
And.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Do you need more coffee, Tyler? Are you good?

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000
I'm okay.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
I'm good. Do you need any more coffee? Okay, cool. Yeah, the coffee must have hit if I decided to go rogue.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I am just pulling up. Something on my end.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
And actually, why don't I just send this to you? So. You can open it on your side.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Sure.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Okay. I think this link should work. But let me know if you have any trouble with it.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Thank you.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Okay, I am looking at ask VA ask a new question

00:38:48.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Okay, awesome. So if you don't mind sharing your screen one more time. We've got about like 15 min so We talked a lot about the dashboard, but there's this obviously this other aspect of actually submitting the inquiry.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Okay.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
So I wanted to just kind of quickly walk through some of those pages with you. So If we were gonna ask a new question here.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Go ahead and like show me what you would do as we like click through these pages.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000
I would I would immediately go to the link that says Ask a new question.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Okay.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Because I've been doing this forever. I wouldn't even give this a second thought. But now because it's new, I would.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Click on it. Can I click on it?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
I'm noisy, I wanna see what it is.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
I think you should be able to, let's see. If it lets you. Yeah.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:50.000
That's education display composition. Okay, so it wasn't like an intuitive like.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Hey, should I be using this? It was just. Some boilerplate language. Okay.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
I'm gonna close that up because I really don't need it. Like I knew all that already.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Okay.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Yeah. Right, that makes sense. Well, yeah, let's go ahead and click on that link you would click on.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.000
And then. What is this showing us?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Hmm. This is. This is different. This is the personal information we have on file for you.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:25.000
So I am Denise Jones now. It shows a partially redacted social security number, my date of birth, my gender and my pronouns.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Really? Do you have all that? Oh, you do have all that already.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:38.000
But in the current ask vie. This comes up. After I tight my question.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Right. Yeah, it's a little bit different. So how is this feeling with this showing up right away?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Different but not completely like throwing me off.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Okay, that makes sense. So it's like it's new, but not throwing you off.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:06.000
You did know it was in this case your information and obviously that would probably be really obvious if it said Laurie York instead of Denise Jones.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Yeah.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Yeah, yeah. And if it did, I would simply click through it. Like I. Once.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.000
When Ask VA launched, right, it was Just like, oh, this is new and I had to get familiar with the pages kinda like this version.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:23.000
I'd be like, oh, my information now 1st click. Done and move on to what I really need to do.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Yep.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Right. Okay, cool. So let's do that. Let's go ahead and just continue.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:33.000
That's probably what you'd kinda quickly do. And then, through these pages, like you, you don't even have to wait.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
You can just click around and show me what you do.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Select the category. You know what's what is throwing me off? Mmm, no, I'm gonna wait.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Yes, yeah.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Can, can I wait? I'm gonna wait. Select the category the best describes your question.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000
So this would be similar to what I'm used to seeing in ASBA. It's kind of a drop.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Is it all on one page now? It's all on one page now instead of page one and page 2.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:11.000
In general, I would be using education benefits and work study. I occasionally would use VR and E but Probably not.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Like for me personally, I'm excited that this one's at the top.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:24.000
And I'm gonna continue. Oh, 10% done. Sub topic

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Oh, a whole bunch of. Again, I would probably use work study a bunch. Okay.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000
So you're gonna, because this is a prototype, you're gonna, I think you're gonna have to choose school certifying officials.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:39.000
But make sense that you would usually do work study.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Okay. 10. And the veteran.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:43:01.000
I'm a family member of a veteran. I am connected to the veteran. Do my work example school certifying official or fiduciary.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
What's surprising?

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000
That's not completely throwing me off. I'm a little, Sure worksite supervisor be in there?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
I'm not used to being called. To do Sherry, but okay.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Hmm. Okay, that makes sense.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
This might be going back to like my original. Thought that I was gonna hold off sharing like on the 1st page where it had my name and information.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Yeah.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:30.000
I'm wondering if like why my would my school in from like, would my school pop up there?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Hmm.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:37.000
For the fact that I'm an SEO. And a worksite supervisor. I don't know if like roles or attached to me that way.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
That makes sense. So.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
It's kind of, it's kind of weird that it took multiple screens to get to.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Associating me with this.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Okay, so you're like for you, it's kind of makes sense that part of your personal information would be your role and maybe your school.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
And that would be something the VA knows.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Yes, but I also get that this is a big system. You know, we all we all know like best friends have to use this family members would use this I'm just a little peon in all of this, so.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
This bigger system.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
But that makes sense. Yeah.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:20.000
So took halfway through the form to get to this.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:30.000
It's not awful, but I Okay. Is the school? Oh, something's connected to me because it's telling me.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:40.000
At 50% through the process that my school is this. Do you want to use the school facility in your it is connected to me?

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Okay. Okay.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Yeah, sorry. So this will just make you go through the long route. So let's say that you had 2 schools.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:52.000
I'll use a different option. Oh. Would you like to choose your school, state, or facility?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
What?

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
What do I do here, Tyler? Oh.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Yeah, so this is giving you the option. Let's say you didn't have a school saved because I know you just have one school.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Yep.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:15.000
So this is funny. But let's say that you had the one school but it wasn't saved in your profile yet so it was it'll 1st ask you would you like to choose your school state or facility?

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:23.000
What would you normally choose? Would you share the facility or the state?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:33.000
It kind of depends on what's on the next screen, like if it was a simple search of like, I could put in a partial school name and find it.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000
I would do it that way if it was like oh I need to pick my state 1st And then it's going to narrow down the list of schools that I have to pick from.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Hmm. I see.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:48.000
I guess I'm channeling like How are other things built? Like FAFSA, how do you want to find your schools?

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Or where do you want to send your transcript to?

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000
It depends on what's on the next, depends on what's on the next screen.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Yeah, for sure. I can see that. Cause if it If you chose school state and then your list of school facilities was shorter, then that would be preferable.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000
Yes.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Right, I get that. Okay. Let's shoot school facility just because that's what the prototype ones.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And then now we're here. We won't be able to actually type. But yeah, you can click in there and we'll pretend like, we're choosing, and we're gonna choose, I wanna say it's Atlanta Institute of Music and Media that it's gonna want you to choose.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Let us have to go college. Okay.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Oh, it's Atlanta Technical College. Okay, so this would be kind of how you're associating a new school with your account, that process.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Oh, okay. Good answer for me. Contact information, email address, preferred name.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Do you have an other for this?

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Kind of, yeah, so at the bottom it'll say you can write them here.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Okay, that doesn't exist in the current system. I know that.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Okay, can I leave these all blank? It's not required, right? Not required. Okay.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:09.000
The reason you are contacting us.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Okay. Does this feel familiar having used the current? Ava.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Yes, because it's like Question, compliment, complaint.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Hmm.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000
It's shorter on the current system. It's like one word. I talk about that.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
I wanted to say something nice. Really? Do people use the system for that? Mine's always I have a question.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Okay. Okay, that's, okay. I put you, I think you're gonna have to choose other, but that makes sense.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:46.000
I am going to have to choose other. Continue. Okay, subject.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Can I actually use any of these? No. Okay.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000
And this, no, we won't be able to use them, but talk to me like, is this feeling familiar with the current Ava and what we're seeing here?

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:04.000
It is. Yep. So Let's say it was that work study timesheet one the 1st one it'd be like Anderson time sheet.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:13.000
June 7, th 2024. The what's your question one for a time sheet is simply like Anderson's time sheet is a attached.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:25.000
Attachment continue and send easy. For something more complicated. It would be. You know, Smith.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Smith, Thomas, you know, overpayment spring of 24 and then details about it in here.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
And that continuum.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Okay. Bye, generally like we're trying to put the student at least the last name in the subject and the question.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Yes.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Do you think? Okay. Yeah.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:52.000
And I think like training purpose wise, we're like. We're told, like, keep the subject generic.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Okay.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000
You can put, you know, a file number, partial file, social data birth in the question box.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
But to keep the subject. Pretty straightforward and generic.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Okay. That makes sense. Well, we'll pretend like you filled it out. You can click continue.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Editing answers. You are only able to edit some answers on this page. You may return to an earlier page.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:25.000
And edit some answers. Okay.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Education Benefits School surfing for so So just a summary of everything we just did. This is an except subject subject.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Okay.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Okay, so if you Okay. Okay. Yeah.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Like no feelings about it. Just like, alright, the This box kind of threw me off. Edit.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
I'm kind of a 1 and done person. I don't know if I would. Think about going back.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Yeah.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Yeah, you might just kinda like go down. I mean, especially for someone like yourself, I think a lot of people would probably feel that way, but especially for folks who use this a lot, like you would probably know what you're doing, you'd get to the end and probably just submit it.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Yes.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. You can click submit if you want to see through the end of the process.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Get your answers and questions. So this is, this would be similar to the email that would. Pop up in my box shortly after submitting it.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:35.000
It would also, it would have like the same textual information. Like we got your thing, here's your reference number.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Yadda yadda. Done. Easy. Done.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Okay, awesome. So this feels like familiar to the email you received that's kind of a like.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Yes.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
I don't really need it, but it's good to know that it was. Submitted and.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
And that kind of thing. Right. Okay, cool.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:57.000
I wouldn't bother printing this page. No.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Close, I would close it and move on to the next thing. Yes.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Okay. Well, that was helpful to watch you. Yeah. You can stop sharing your screen whenever you like.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
I see we've got like 5 min left. How did you find that overall?

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
It's a little bit different to how it currently works.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000
I feel

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:27.000
I feel good about it. I mean, I don't consider myself a techy expert, but in this day and age like we all get used to like.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:40.000
You're bank moving stuff around on their app or Facebook changing the way things are ordered. It's like it's not gonna blow people's minds and create a lot of angry feelings about, well, where is this?

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:55.000
The biggest like that I had as you saw was like just end part to like the order in which things were presented about who I am, when do I actually get to ask my question kind of that.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:02.000
But I don't have like a right or wrong order in which to do it either like. We know it's like as it is right now, it's clunky. It's in different parts.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:10.000
It's in different sections. In my mind like I want to get the students information in there and get it correctly.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:17.000
But I'm also concerned that it's connected to me too. So,

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:24.000
That makes sense. I think overall like it's good that it feels like straightforward enough that like, it's not gonna totally throw you off.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Yep.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:32.000
You would be able to get yourself through that form. I could tell. But I do see your point about like, the information about yourself.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Would also maybe include your role and it would also maybe include your school and the way that that happened in the form is a little funny.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Yup.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Because you are a school certifying official and a work study site supervisor, that question about your role, do would you answer it differently depending on the submission or how would that work?

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Yes, like I currently there is a dropdown in the current SBA system of like

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:06.000
What best describes you or something like that. So I would submit that I'm a work so supervisor when I'm submitting work study type things.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:18.000
I don't think VA would ever like kick it back to me. If I said I'm an SEO, oh, but I'm submitting a timesheet so

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:29.000
I'm just doing it the way that I've been taught shown and

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Oh, okay, sure.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Yeah. No, that makes sense. I didn't really have a good understanding that people could be both until kind of this week and I've spoken to another person and so I it kind of occurred to me that like Some people might be both and they might change their role depending on their submission.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Or is it more helpful for you to say like, I'm both of these things like what exactly does the VA need from you?

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Nice.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
So I don't think you're doing anything wrong with the way you're doing it, but, that was just kind of an interesting thing for me with the role.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:04.000
We've got 3 min left. Is there anything else you want to share with me about Ask VA about anything we talked about?

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:09.000
No, I'm just curious when this is gonna locked.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Yeah.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Thank you.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Yeah, I'll say like it will launch in the near-ish future. To get a really big answer.

But yeah, I think you'll probably, get a heads up when it's launching because we know like the folks who are using this for the business side, are using it a lot.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:34.000

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
