## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when they’re separating through aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

## Methodology

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity.

We will present a scenario where the submitter has a question about their **education benefits**.

We will let submitters **choose whether to sign in or not without guidance**. If they don't choose to sign in up front, they'll be prompted by a modal or alert to sign in after they choose their category and topic. In this scenario, they will need to sign in to continue. We will pre-fill certain parts of the form with mock data.

These are the main components and/or pages, we're testing:
- Progress bar
- Homepage (Unauthenticated)
- Dashboard without cards
- Sign in interruption
