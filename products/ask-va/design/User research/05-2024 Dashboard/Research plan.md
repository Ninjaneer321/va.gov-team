## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO FY24 priority:

* Better experiences: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at many stages of the Veteran journey. They may use Ask VA when they’re separating through aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Understand how submitters find a question in their dashboard
* Understand what submitters need to learn when they review their question's details
* Understand whether submitters can learn the status of their inquiry without signing in

### Outcome

This research will help us determine if and how we need to improve the design and content of Ask VA. This study will also inform future research objectives.

### Research questions

Understand how submitters find a question in their dashboard:
* How do people find a question in their dashboard?
* Which labels or details are useful in identifying a specific question? For example, category, reference number, or date.
* Do people expect to be able to 'search' their dashboard?
* Can people find the question they're looking for?
* How does this differ if you have a few or a lot of questions in your dashboard? And/or, if you're a business submitter?
* Do the statuses and icons make sense in this context?
* Can people find the link to review the details of their inquiry?
* What do people expect to happen when they click 'Check details'?

Understand what submitters need to learn when they review their question's details:
* Can submitters successfully navigate to their question details?
* What do people notice first when they review their question details?
* Which labels or details are useful when people check their question details?
* Do people scroll down to check the reply from VA, and can they find it?
* Do submitters understand how or if they can reply back to VA?
* If they can't reply to VA, what would submitters do if they have an issue or follow-up question?

Understand whether submitters can learn the status of their inquiry without signing in:
* Can people find where to search to check their question's status without signing in?
* Do people know where to find their reference number?
* Why might people choose to check their question's status without or before signing in?
* Do the statuses, icons and descriptions make sense in this context?
* Are people aware they can sign in to review the details, if they authenticated originally?
* If available, can people make the jump from checking the status of their question (before sign in) to signing in?

### Hypotheses

1. People with few inquiries in their dashboard will be able to quickly identify the question they're looking for.
2. People with few or many inquiries in their dashboard will use the date to identify the question they're looking for.
3. People will expect to be able to search in their dashboard using keywords in the question or category.
4. The statuses and icons will be distinguishable and understood.
5. People may confuse the date submitted (H3) with the date last updated.
6. It will be straightforward to find the link to check details, but some people will think they can click on the entire card.
7. On the details page, people will scroll past details to look for a reply from VA.
8. People who can't respond to VA will be unsure what to do if they have a follow up question or issue.
9. People will assume they should sign in order to check the status of their question.
10. If people check their status without signing in, they will only choose to sign in if they have received a reply.

## Methodology

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use Figma prototypes with limited interactivity.

We will present a scenario where the submitter has already asked VA a question and is ready to check if they have a reply.

These are the main features we're testing:
- Check the status of your question (Unauthenticated)
- Find a question in your dashboard (Authenticated)
- Check question details (Authenticated)

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will work with Perigean to recruit Veterans.

We will also work the GI Bill team to recruit business submitters, such as Work study site supervisors or School Certifying Officials (SCOs).
