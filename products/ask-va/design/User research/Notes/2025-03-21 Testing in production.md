## Conversation guide

### Introduction (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is `Tyler or Ariel`. How are you?

[Ask everyone to introduce themselves.]

Today, we're going to test the new Ask VA experience on VA.gov.

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **We have 1 hour scheduled together.** I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **I want to be clear that we’re not testing your ability.** We're doing this so we can find any issues with the tool before we launch.
- **We're going to be testing in production today.** This means, we're using the real version of VA.gov, not a test version. You will use your ID.me or Login.gov account to sign in and complete the form. At certain points, your personal information will be on the screen. We will make sure that you're not sharing your screen with us when this is the case.
- **The last thing is about recordings.** Do you mind if we record this session for our notes?
  - `IF NO` Don't record.
  - `IF YES` Start recording.
 
Thanks for that. Do you have any questions for me before we start?
