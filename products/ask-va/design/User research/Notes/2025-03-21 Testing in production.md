We will test the following tasks in production:
- Log into VA.gov and submit an inquiry
- View the submitted inquiry in the VA.gov dashboard
- Reply to the submitted inquiry in the VA.gov dashboard
- View replies to the submitted inquiry in the VA.gov dashboard

## Conversation guide

### Introduction (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is `Tyler or Ariel`. How are you?

[Ask everyone to introduce themselves.]

Today, we're going to test the new Ask VA experience on VA.gov.

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **I want to be clear that we’re not testing your ability.** We're doing this so we can find any issues with the tool before we launch.
- **We're going to be testing in production today.** This means, we're using the real version of VA.gov, not a test version. You will use your ID.me or Login.gov account to sign in and complete the form.
- Last thing is about recordings. Do you mind if we record this session for our notes?
  - `IF NO` Don't record.
  - `IF YES` Start recording.
