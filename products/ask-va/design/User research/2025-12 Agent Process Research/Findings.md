## Research Goals
This research will surface pain points and opportunities that exist within the different Business Lines’ Agent processes. By learning their processes we will be able to make better decisions about how to streamline the form to reduce the burden on submitters. 

We specifically hope to learn:

* The differences across business line processes for Agents in providing responses  
* How fields like category, topic, attachments, subject, contact info, and school are leveraged in the Agent’s process to triage, re-route, and respond to submissions  
* How email templates and/or knowledge bases are used to respond to inquiries  
* Business constraints and how they may be limiting an Agent


## Research questions

`1.` What are the differences in processes between business lines, and why do the differences exist?

`2.` What opportunities are there to improve response time and quality? 

`3.` How are the fields submitted in the form being used by the Agents?  

`4.` Are there differences in processes for “business” vs. “personal” inquiries?

## Methodology 

**Research method:** Contextual inquiries

- I want to fully learn their processes, so I will have them lead me through their full process to understand their flow both in and out of the Ask VA system. 

**Moderation style:** Moderated \- facilitator led  
**Location:** Remote over VA Teams  
**Timeframe:** 60 minutes

See [presentation](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=sBnwzI) for detailed findings at each step of the process.


## Recommendations

### Highest Impact Recommendations
1. **Re-route logic to include location field(s)** – This may have the biggest impact on response times for complicated inquiries. ([See pain points for Re-routing](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=jpGY8K&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyNSwiY0lkIjozOTA1OTYyMzc3fQ))
2. **Usability and layout of Inquiry Report** – This is a highly repeatable task that would improve the Agents view of an inquiry’s history ([See pain points for inquiry report](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=s2o719&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyOCwiY0lkIjozNTg2MDQ3MjV9))
3. **Reporting for total inquiry “movement” (re-routes, splits, etc.)** – This is being tracked by Agents today and will help Supervisors better diagnose recurring re-routes. ([See pain points for ongoing monitoring](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=OFM4yl&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyOSwiY0lkIjo0MTEzMzE2OTQ4fQ))
4. **Better real-time reporting in AVA** -  Agents and Supervisors could benefit from a real-time dashboard within AVA of their of pending and opened inquiries, as well as how many inquiries a group of Agents has completed. ([See pain points for ongoing monitoring](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=OFM4yl&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyOSwiY0lkIjo0MTEzMzE2OTQ4fQ))

### Moderate Impact Recommendations
1. **Streamlined attachment review** – About 34% of inquiries are submitted with attachments. ([See attachment data](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/data/Usage%20data.md#how-many-submissions-are-submitted-with-attachments))
2. **Threaded correspondence** – For inquiries with a lot of back and forth, this will improve the Agent’s ability to review the inquiry’s history easily. This could also circumvent the need for improvements to the inquiry report, but I expect this to be more difficult than improving the report. ([See pain points for assessing inquiry](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=zWcSVa&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyNCwiY0lkIjoxNzIyNDQ4Mn0))
3. **More differentiated inquiry detail layout** – In conjunction with adding threaded correspondence, I think improvements of the layout could how much time it takes to review each inquiry. ([See pain points for assessing inquiry](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=zWcSVa&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyNCwiY0lkIjoxNzIyNDQ4Mn0))
4. **Response formatting and spell check** – Although more robust formatting and spell-checking capabilities are expected, I’m not sure how many people would use it as opposed to their own workarounds regardless. ([See pain points for crafting a response](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=vnaY6m&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyNiwiY0lkIjoyODQ3NzA1NzM2fQ))
5. **Simpler reporting for large teams** – This could be a matter of training or creating custom reports for a few teams with many Agents. ([See pain points for ongoing monitoring](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=OFM4yl&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyOSwiY0lkIjo0MTEzMzE2OTQ4fQ))

### Low Impact Recommendations
1. **Question content search** – Enabling search of multiple keywords on views would help Education Supervisors with assigning inquiries for specific skillsets. This is not their primary means of assigning inquiries though. ([See pain points for assigning inquiries](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=gvMO1W&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyMCwiY0lkIjoxODk3NzQxOTIzfQ))
2. **Better Standard Text search** – Improvements can be made here, but I’m not sure how many more people would use them as opposed to their own saved templates. ([See pain points for crafting a response](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=vnaY6m&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyNiwiY0lkIjoyODQ3NzA1NzM2fQ))
3. **Helper text on New Action description field** – Information indicating who would be able to read this description might help an Agent understand why it’s important to write something in there or to send a response instead. ([See pain points for duplicates](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=N2dKXa&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyNSwiY0lkIjozOTA1OTYyMzc3fQ))
4. **Optional New Action description field** – This field may be redundant for some types of actions and isn’t being used effectively so it just becomes an extra step. ([See pain points for duplicates](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=N2dKXa&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyNSwiY0lkIjozOTA1OTYyMzc3fQ))
5. **Report “days open in current queue”** – For queues that get re-routed many times before getting to the right queue, the “days open” metric isn’t accurate for the team that end up solving it. ([See pain points for ongoing monitoring](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/AskVA/Shared%20Documents/General/AVA%20VA.gov%20Team/Research%20%26%20Design/Research%20Repository/Agent%20Process%20Findings%20and%20Recommendations.pptx?d=w03a91f16cf4e440da08fc343380a5f5d&csf=1&web=1&e=OFM4yl&nav=eyJzSWQiOjMyOSwiY0lkIjo0MTEzMzE2OTQ4fQ))

### Potential bugs 
1. **Missing attachments** – From custom views, inquiries with attachments aren’t always getting flagged as such. 
2. **Advanced queue search for re-routes** – The text search didn’t work, and the Agent had to scroll the whole list to find the specific VA location queue
3. **Total unassigned inquiries cap** – The number of total inquiries unassigned to a group is capped at 5000. This is one of the only real-time metrics that can be pulled directly from AVA versus PowerBI which updates daily. 


## Next Steps

1. Met with CRM team to discuss the findings and pain points in more detail.
2. CRM team will assess priorities and meet with CRM VA PO.

## Further research needed

**In-person Agent observations** – This will provide additional context to the multiple roles Agents play in supporting Veterans and their families
**Additional interviews with other BLs** – This will help us to better prioritize the needs of more lines of business.
