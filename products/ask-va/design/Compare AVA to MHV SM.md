## Background

We recognize that there are similaries between My HealtheVet's Secure Messaging platform and Ask VA, which are both migrating to VA.gov. There are also some distinct differences in how they are used and current functionality.

We wanted to explore their research and designs to help inform how we understand Ask VA and which updates we make in order to make these products as consistent as possible, for the benefit of Veterans and other users.

### Next steps

These are our next steps based on our review:

#### 1. Add messaging to direct people inÂ an emergency

Secure Messaging and the chatbot both include more messaging about emergencies. We should include messaging up front that directs people in an emergency. We may also want to reinforce this messaging when someone chooses the health care category.
