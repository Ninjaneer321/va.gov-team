## Overview
Ask VA users submit questions about VA benefits and services at, [Ask VA](https://www.va.gov/contact-us/ask-va/introduction).

In 2025 the Ask VA team executed an [Inbox Usability Study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/design/User%20research/2025-10%20Form%20and%20Inbox%20Usability%20Study). 
Key findings support implementing enhancements to the current form flow to distiguish entry points (CTAs) between Ask VA personal users and Ask VA business users.

We are currently distinguishing between personal and business users with the following language in our design mocks.  2/10/26 meeting with CAIA to guide Ask VA team on proper language to be used.

## Problem statement
**Background**

Ask VA users want to easily and quickly view their submitted questions using; search, filter and sort tooling. The current inbox experience displays submitted questions (also referred to as "inquiries") in a grid format, with a card representing each inquiry.  The cards do not display in a user friendly way, often leaving users confused of the order their information is displayed.  Users want the ability to filter their inquiries by category type, status and sort by newest to oldest or oldest to newest.

**Solution**

Update the Ask VA inbox by implementing the VADS guidance and [new standard](https://design.va.gov/components/search-filter).

## Outcomes
- **User Experience Outcomes**: Users have an accessible and easy interaction with their personalized inbox.
-  **Functional Outcomes**:  The VADS guidance and standard operates correctly with Ask VA application.
- **Business Outcomes**: Improved inbox usability and efficiency for Ask VA users.  Decreased dissatisfied feedback collected via the feedback button and intercept survey responses.
