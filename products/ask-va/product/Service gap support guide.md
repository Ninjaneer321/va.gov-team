## Support tasks
To sustain Ask VA, we primarily need system reliability and availability support. This support ensures **submitters can continue to use Ask VA on VA.gov.**

## Incident response
Follow these steps when someone discovers an issue or when an error comes through Datadog.

1. **Assess severity and priority**: Use the tables below to assess severity and priority.
   
|Severity|Description|
|:--|:--|
|Severity 1*|Significantly impacts a userâ€™s ability to submit an inquiry and get their question answered|
|Severity 2|Fast follow, post launch items E.g. Missing content|
|Severity 3|Backlog E.g. Spacing issues, names not allowing apostrophes or hyphens|

*Always prioritize Severity 1 issues with Priority 1

|Priority - Denotes urgency within a severity category|Description|
|:--|:--|
|Priority 1|Top priority|
|Priority 2|Less urgent but needed|
|Priority 3|Low urgency|

We've been tracking issues after launching on VA.gov [in this Excel file](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/AskVA/EWNfTVN1y_lGuewV4hmQGZ8BpWLewORLJNhiNil8X4cZ_Q?e=YekMCw).

4. **Document issue**: Check the [Ask VA repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/ask-va) to check if it's documented. If not, create a GitHub issue for it. 
5. **Determine next steps**: There are a few options for next steps:
   - **Remediate, if Severity 1 Priority 1 OR Severity 2 Priority 2**: We prioritize these issues for immediate remediation. Review [the Excel file](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/AskVA/EWNfTVN1y_lGuewV4hmQGZ8BpWLewORLJNhiNil8X4cZ_Q?e=YekMCw) for previous examples.
   - **Backlog, if a lower severity/priority**: These are issues we can remediate later.
   - **Rollback to the classic Ask VA experience, if a Severity 1 Priority 1 OR Severity 2 Priority 2 cannot be remediated in a timely fashion**: Since we're new on VA.gov, we can rollback to the previous Ask VA experience. We should make all attempts to fix the issue on VA.gov first though. For example, we rolled back when we discovered a security issue.
