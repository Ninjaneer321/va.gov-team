## Overview
This initiative brings current form functionality to the VA.gov platform and complete an integration with the existing backend MS Dynamics CRM. We'll identify design and content enhancements that can be made. Unless something is critical to usability, we won't make major changes that will affect current workflows used by CRM agents when answering user inquiries.

## Problem statement
**Background**: The current implementation of Ask VA (AVA) lives in a standalone Microsoft portal. It's not consistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile friendly, and has accessibility issues.  

**Solution**: Bring the Ask VA frontend to VA.gov. Update the frontend to align with the VA.gov modernized platform, making it easier for Veterans and all users to use the tool and resolve their concerns. 

## Outcomes
- **User experience outcomes**: Ensure users have an easy and accessible interaction with Ask VA.
- **Functional outcomes**: Ensure the system operates correctly and efficiently with Ask VA.
- **Business outcomes**: Ensures increased efficiency for VA customer support.
