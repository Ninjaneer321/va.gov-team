# About this research

## Study
We haven't created an associated Research Repository issue for this study yet.

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/ask-va-phase-1-product-outline.md) includes more details about the scope of Phase 1 of our work.

## Research goals
* Review whether Veterans can successfully ask a health care question about their own benefits
* Review whether business roles can successfully ask an education question on behalf of a Veteran
* Evaluate the ease of reviewing an inquiry from the dashboard

## Recruitment
We will work with Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research. We will also recruit business roles with the help of the GI Bill team.

## Date
This research is expected to take place in April and May 2024.
