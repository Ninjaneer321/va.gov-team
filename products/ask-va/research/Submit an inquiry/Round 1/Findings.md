## Research goals
Ask VA can support Veterans, their family members, and other submitters at all stages of the Veteran journey, from starting up to aging.

The key goals of this study were to:

- Review whether Veterans understand when they need to authenticate and the benefits of authentication
- Review the experience of a Veteran asking a question about their own benefits
- Understand what Veterans expect to happen after they submit a question

## Research questions

Review whether Veterans understand when they need to authenticate and the benefits of authentication:
* Is it clear when you need to authenticate vs. when it’s optional?
* Are the other benefits of authenticating clear?

Review the experience of a Veteran asking a question about their own benefits:
* Is the purpose of Ask VA clear?
* Is there information missing on any question, page or sequence of pages?
* Are there too many or too few fields per page?
* Is it clear why each question is being asked?
* Do users understand how to edit their answers on the review page?

Understand what Veterans expect to happen after they submit a question:
* Is it clear what happens after you submit a question?
* Are there any surprises or outstanding questions after reading information on the submission page?

## Methodology 

This was a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We used a Figma prototype with limited interactivity.

We tested the following steps:
* Start page
* Chapter 1: Category and topic
* Chapter 2: Your question
* Chapter 3: Personal information
  * Only ‘My own benefits; I’m the Veteran’ branch
* Chapter 4: Review and submit
* Submission page

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

|Hypothesis|Conclusion|Explanation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Some users will think authentication is required in order to ask any question.|Definitely True|At first glance, all users think that authentication is required to ask any question.|
|Most Veterans will find the form fields are straightforward and intuitive to use.|Definitely True|Most form fields (radio buttons, text input, checkboxes) were very intuitive to use. Facility search is the only place we saw potential confusion.|
|Some users will be surprised at the amount of information they have to give in order to ask a question.|Definitely True|All users were surprised by the length of the form and most users didn't expect to have to give this much information to ask a question.|
|Some users will misinterpret the chapter numbers as the number of pages, and be surprised at the length of the form.|Definitely True|Most users were confused by the progress bar because they interpret the chapters as steps.|
|Some users will be confused about which information they can edit on the review page and which they cannot.|Likely True|While all users can identify the right 'Edit' button on the review page, some users think they can edit their contact preference, which is not editable.|
|Most users will expect an estimate of how long it will take to receive a reply.|Definitely True|All users notice the 7 days turnaround time and don't expect a more specific estimate than that.|

## Key Findings

1. Veterans past experiences and trust in VA impact how they perceive questions and what information they're comfortable sharing.
2. Many Veterans will choose to sign in so their information is pre-filled, but don't fully understand when sign in is required to use Ask VA.
3. As Veterans get further into the form, they become more unsure about what progress they've made and what to expect next.
4. Most Veterans considered what their benefits cover in order to answer, 'What's your question about?' – which is unrelated.
5. Veterans refer to their health facility by the location, like "Atlanta VA", rather than the full name, "Joseph Maxwell Cleland Atlanta VAMC".
6. Most Veterans understand the purpose of reviewing their information before they submit a question, and can find the specific 'Edit' button they need.
7. Veterans who are familiar with other VA services expect Ask VA to work similarly – and it may be unclear when to use Ask VA or another service.

## Details of Findings 

**Finding 1: Veterans past experiences and trust in VA impact how they perceive questions and what information they're comfortable sharing.**

Labels: AUD: Veterans, PRDT: AVA

Veterans often begin interactions with the VA feeling frustrated and cautious.

When a question feels irrelevant or it's unclear why the VA is asking for certain information, Veterans make assumptions. For example, Veterans worry that their service will be impacted if they respond "no" to "Are you a VA employee?"

Similarly, Veterans react negatively to required questions about their pronouns and gender, with most people saying they would prefer not to answer.

Concerns about who will see their information and answer their question make Veterans cautious about sharing sensitive information.

> "It's almost a balance of power thing. The VA requires me to give all these little blocks of information. But they aren't required to give anything back. Whereas, on secure messaging, I'm asking a known person or at least agency, like my primary care physician's office, a question. It feels more human." P5

> "A wee bit intrusive again. Somebody's gender identity shouldn't have any bearing on VA benefits." P5

> "'Are you a VA employee?' Why this is here? [...] Because it means if you're [an] employee, instead of waiting 6 months to get an answer then [they] answer you right away?" P2

> "[I'm worried about giving my] Social Security number, because this is gonna go to a general mailbox [...] It's not going to a specific person or department." P8

> "[I'd like to know] where the question was going to [...] I want to feel like the skilled people are handling this issue." P1
