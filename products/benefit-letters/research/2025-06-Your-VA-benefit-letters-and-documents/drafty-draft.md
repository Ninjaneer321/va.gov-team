## The Veteran’s journey
This research supports Veterans in the "Taking care of myself" phase of the Veteran journey by improving access to benefit letters needed to verify eligibility and status for various VA benefits and external services.

### Key moments benefit letters support:
* Veterans applying for property tax exemptions.
* Veterans verifying service-connected disabilities for employment.
* Veterans accessing financial services require benefit verification.
* Veterans obtaining documentation for state and local benefit programs.

### Outcomes we aimed to achieve:
* Remove barriers for Veterans trying to access benefit letters.
* Understand Veteran motivations for obtaining benefit letters.
* Assess the impact of mailing address requirements on letter accessibility.

## Research Goals
- **Goal 1:** Verify that the new design removes barriers for Veterans trying to find, understand, and use the benefit letters.
- **Goal 2:** Understand what motivates Veterans to get their benefit letters.
- **Goal 3:** Understand how the mailing address requirement affects different Veteran populations.

## Research Questions
### Goal 1: Verify that the new design removes barriers for Veterans trying to find, understand, and use the benefit letters
* Will Veterans feel they need to edit their address before downloading a letter?
* Do Veterans expand the accordions when looking for their letters?
* What do veterans expect when they click on a link to a benefits letter?
* What challenges do Veterans encounter when generating a customized Benefit Summary and Service Verification Letter?

### Goal 2: Understand why Veterans want benefit letters
* Which letters do Veterans find valuable?
* Do Veterans understand the different types of letters and why they are needed before they come to the page?
* Do Veterans know why they need to include or exclude certain information from their Benefit Summary and Service Verification Letter?
* What do Veterans do if they don't see the letter they're looking for?

### Goal 3: Understand the impact of the mailing address requirement on downloading and viewing benefit letters
* What problems can result from making letter access dependent on a required mailing address?
* What happens if a Veteran doesn't currently have a mailing address?
* Are we doing a good job communicating that this mailing address is the "latest and greatest" that appears on the Veteran's VA.gov profile?
* Do Veterans expect their customized Benefit Summary and Service Verification Letter to include their current mailing address, too?

## Methodology
Remote, moderated, one-hour, semi-structured interviews and usability testing with the "Your VA benefit letters and documents" screens on the fully functioning production version.
* **Method 1**: Semi-structured interview about letter usage and experiences.
* **Method 2**: Task-based usability testing on desktop and mobile devices.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

* **Veterans are more likely to find the letter type they need when presented with clear, concise categorization and descriptions up front rather than hidden on a secondary screen.**
  * **"Definitely true"**
  * Veterans successfully navigated letter options and appreciated clear descriptions. ==P14: "It's pretty cut and paste standard...even if I didn't know what [a letter] was, I could read about it."==
* **Veterans who encounter the redesigned single-step page will complete the View Letters step at a rate higher than the current design (current: 60%).**
  * **"Likely true"**
  * While most Veterans successfully completed tasks, navigation paths varied significantly, suggesting improvement but not elimination of all friction.
* **Making the mailing address change to the VA.gov profile optional and the reasoning clear will increase download rates (current: 55%).**
  * **“Not enough info”**
  * In the end, we couldn’t make the mailing address change to the VA.gov profile optional, and we also had to roll back the alerts we were using to clarify the address change and its reasoning. We did learn that 45% of our participants (P1, P5, P11, P12, P14) generally believed that the benefit letters shouldn’t be so tightly connected to the Veteran’s mailing address.

## Key Findings

1. Veterans successfully navigated to benefit letters, but did not find one clear path.
2. Documents with similar names, like the "Benefit Summary and Verification Letter" and the "Benefit Verification Letter," confuse Veterans and make them download a few documents to find the right one
3. Veterans like that they can customize their Benefit Summary and Verification Letter because it gives them more control
4. Veterans don't all understand that changing their address on this page changes it in other places, which could cause problems they didn't expect
5. Veterans expect to be able to download their letters even if they don't have a mailing address on file
6. Veterans using assistive technology might miss important context
7. Veterans expect to find a complete list of all the letters that apply to them online.
8. Veterans like the address validation because it makes them feel confident their information is correct

### Details of Findings
#### Finding 1: Veterans successfully navigated to benefit letters, but did not find one clear path
Most participants (P1, P2, P5, P11, P12, P14, P15) signed in first before looking for benefit letters. Navigation methods varied significantly: keyword search (P1), dropdown menu (P11), top pages/Records section (P5, P12, P14), and search functionality (P14).
* *P1: "I would keyword search for benefit letters.”*
* *p7: “I normally search for it. I'd type 'document letter' or the specific name of the letter.”*
* *P15 found the dropdown menu confusing: "When it said just 'letters,' that didn't make sense to me...what kind of letters?"*

#### Finding 2: Documents with similar names, like the "Benefit Summary and Verification Letter" and the "Benefit Verification Letter," confuse Veterans and make them download a few documents to find the right one
6 out of 11 participants (55%) were confused by the similarly named documents "Benefit Summary and Service Verification Letter" and "Benefit Verification Letter."
* *P1: "Unclear what the difference is between 'Benefit Verification letter' and 'Benefit Summary and Verification Letter.’”*
* *P2: “What's the difference between ‘benefit summary and verification’ and ‘benefit verification’? I guess one is for sharing with others and one is for yourself...I see what the difference is, but don't understand why there needs to be two.”*
* *P7: “The names are a little confusing. I had to open both to understand the difference.”*
* *P12: "Benefit verification letter vs [top letter] it's not clear...it's definitely confusing.”*

#### Finding 3: Veterans like that they can customize their Benefit Summary and Verification Letter because it gives them more control
All participants who attempted customization successfully used the feature, with 4 out of 11 participants (36%) calling it a “game-changer.”
* *P3: "The opportunity right there [to select what to include in the letter] is phenomenal.”*
* *P3: “This was a game-changer...we used to have to call and wait a few weeks, if you were lucky.”*
* *P14: "I like that it gave you the option to choose what you want and don't want in your letter...before it used to include everything.”*
* *P15: “I like that when you do go here to download benefit letters, it gives you one that I can pick and choose what I need.”* 
* *P11: “I like that you can choose what to include in the letter.”*

#### Finding 4: Veterans don't all understand that changing their address on this page changes it in other places, which could cause problems they didn't expect
5 out of 11 participants (45%) didn't realize that updating their address on the benefit letters page updates their entire VA profile.
* *P1: "That was not clear to me...[that my address would be updated elsewhere].”*
* *P11: "In my mind, I thought it would just change my address in my letter, not in my profile...that's not an action I would typically expect.”*

#### Finding 5: Veterans expect to be able to download their letters even if they don't have a mailing address on file
5 out of 11 participants (45%) expected to access benefit letters without a valid mailing address, citing concerns for homeless Veterans.
* *P7: "I would hope the letters are still available. You might be in between homes or homeless—those documents are still needed.”*
* *P11: "If I were homeless, I would have a problem with [the letters not showing up without an address].”*
* *P14: “Even if I didn't have a mailing address listed in there, I would think that I could still go in there and access a benefit letter.”*

#### Finding 6: Veterans using assistive technology might miss important context
Text-to-speech software (Speechify) failed to read critical information, creating accessibility barriers.
* *P7: "Speechify didn't read out that you could pick options like 'monthly benefit amount' or 'military service’.”*
* P7: "It skipped the note about the address change affecting my whole profile—that's critical.”

#### Finding 7: Veterans expect to find a complete list of all the letters that apply to them online
* *P1 used letters for "financial aid for mother's medical procedure" and "summer pool pass discount.”*
* * P2: “It would be great if it said federal and then showed the state for things you can explore.”*
* *P7: “I needed a narrative summary...Neither I nor my VSO could find the letter on VA.gov. I had to call the VA to get it.”*
* * P10 uses letters "any time I need to certify or re-certify for SDVOSB application.”*
* *P12: “Is it possible to only show letters that apply to me?”*

#### Finding 8: Veterans like the address validation because it makes them feel confident their information is correct
Veterans valued address validation for accuracy despite questioning requirements.
* *P14: "I've entered an extra one or a zero by mistake [on other websites] at the end of my address and was glad they caught it...this is nice.”*
* *P10: "I want to be careful about the address I want on my letter...my medications might go there, so I need to be careful about that.”*

## Findings Beyond Original Research Plan

### Veterans confuse benefit letters with claim and decision letters
Multiple participants (P4, P5, P12) initially confused benefit letters with claims or decision letters, showing broader mental model mismatches.
* *P5: "Mixing up benefit and decision letters initially.”*
* *P12 initially navigated to the Claim Status Tool when asked to return to benefit letters*.

### Critical Text-to-Speech Compatibility Issues with Speechify
Speechify and similar commercial TTS tools had significant compatibility problems beyond traditional screen readers.
* *P7 noted Speechify required highlighting section by section to read pages logically*.
* *Commercial TTS tools missed interactive elements and critical alerts*.

### Some Veterans were confused about hoe to get back to the benefit letters page after viewing PDF letter in new tab
Veterans expected PDF behavior patterns from other websites, affecting navigation when PDFs opened in the same tabs.
* *P15: "Got stuck trying to get back to the previous page. Was unsure how to go back to the previous tab.”*
* *Multiple participants struggled with PDF navigation back to the letters page*.

### Some Veterans are skeptical about their mailing address getting updated across services
Veterans expressed skepticism about cross-system functionality.
* *P1: "I see the alert. Do I believe it? I'm more skeptical...If I believed the world was flat [I would believe the alert message].”*

### Veterans want a list of available state-specific benefits based on their mailing address
* *P2: "If you could put in this address, then these are benefits you could consider for your area and benefit situation.”*

### Veterans like that the page is simple and easy to follow, which makes it easier to use
* *P2 “It's what I expected.”*
* *P10: “I really appreciate the brevity and cleanliness of the website overall. It’s so much better than in the past.”*
* *P11: “I think it is very direct about what the page is providing and how to get there...I also like that it shows a brief description of what each letter is about.”*
* *P14: “It's pretty cut and [dry]...even if I didn't know what [a letter] was, I could read about it.”*

#### DD214 Critically Important
Multiple participants emphasized the importance of DD214 and appreciated prominent access.
* *P3: "DD214 is typically the letter that is problematic for Veterans.”*
* *P15: "Most important thing is to find the 214.”*
