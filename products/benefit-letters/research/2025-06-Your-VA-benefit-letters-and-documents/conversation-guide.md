### Day of the session

**Before all sessions**:
- Review the participant list for participant name and screener question responses
- Check Settings > In Meeting (Advanced) > Automated captions, Full transcript, Save captions are all ON
- Check Settings > Meeting > In Meeting (Basic) > Sound notification when someone joins or leaves OFF
  - In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check Settings > Meeting > In Meeting (Basic) > Screen sharing > Who can share > All Participants
- Check Settings > Meeting > In Meeting (Basic) > Hide participant profile pictures in a meeting ON
- Mute Slack and all other notifications
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).
- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.


### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, ensure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked.
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.
- If the participant is using a screen reader, wear headphones to prevent the user's screen reader from echoing back to them *(recommendation from Cindy).*
- When users share their screen, the ‚ÄúShare sound‚Äù box must be checked if we want the recording to pick up screen reader announcements. This box is on the right pane when the screen share is started. [Need to confirm if the moderator can check this box for their participants or if the participant has to do it themselves.]


# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today\! My name is Shawn, and <mark>[NOTETAKER NAME\]</mark> is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today, we're going to talk about Benefit Letters and Documents.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

* **This session should take about 60 (or 90 for AT) minutes.** I want to be sure to end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the following question or topic.  
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we‚Äôre not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't take anything personally\!  
* **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You don‚Äôt have to participate if you don't want to, and your choice to participate will not affect your benefits in any way. If you decide you need to stop at any time, you‚Äôll still be compensated for your time.  
* I want you to know that although I work on the VA.gov website, I have no access to your records or benefits, nor do I have the ability to change your claims or benefits in any way. I am not a specialist in benefits. My primary focus is to understand your experience with the website  
* The people from Perigean who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Is it okay with you to have \[specific number\] people join us to observe this session?   
  * **If not,** use Slack to ask the observers to leave the Zoom.  
  * **If yes,** admit observers.  
    * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, such as their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the observation interaction for the participant.)  
    * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth  
* **Today, you'll interact with a live demo.** Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.  
* **I‚Äôd like to ask your permission to record my screen and audio as we talk today.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are deleted, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.  
  * Knowing this, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  
* If yes, **once I start recording, I will confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**
`‚û°Ô∏è Start recording.`
* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you okay with me recording my screen and the audio as we talk today?  

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

### Follow-up questions (If needed)

## Task 5: Finding and Downloading a Proof of Service Card

# Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
[**Type into #feedback-backchannel**: "Any questions you want me to ask?"]

* Overall, about everything on the website in this session...What worked \*well\* for you?  
* What was \*unclear or didn't work well\* for you?  
  * \[If they say nothing, could ask:\] What, if anything, did you find annoying?  
* What would you like to \*change or add\*?  
* Is there anything we haven't discussed that I should know?

## Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and ask one more question about the video recording. \*\*Is it okay with you if we share a video clip of part of this session with our VA partners?\*\* We‚Äôd want to do this if we find a clip that demonstrates the need for an improvement or other helpful example of Veteran needs. We remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and would only share the video clips with VA partners with the purpose of improving [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) and other digital experiences.   
  * If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?  
* \<mark\>\[Record answer here\]\</mark\>


## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well, we appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks\! Lastly, Perigean will send you a thank-you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to give them the chance to participate in future research.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day\!
