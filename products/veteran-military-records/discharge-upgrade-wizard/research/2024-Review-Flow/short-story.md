# Simplifying the Discharge Upgrade Process for Veterans

*Research Findings: Discharge Upgrade Wizard Usability Testing*

## tl;dr (too long, didn’t read)
This study highlighted how Veterans navigate and understand the Discharge Upgrade Wizard, revealing opportunities to improve content clarity, accessibility, and submission processes.

## What we did
The Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTO-DE) conducted remote moderated usability testing with 10 Veterans from October 22 to November 7, 2024. The goal was to assess whether the Discharge Upgrade Wizard helps Veterans edit answers, understand branching logic, and navigate the review flow effectively, including for assistive technology users.

## Key insights
- **Editing flows are intuitive, but some alerts go unnoticed.** ([Line 157](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-upgrade-wizard/research/2024-Review-Flow/research-findings.md#L157))
  - Quote: “That’s super easy.” (p11)
- **Content clarity needs improvement.** ([Line 373](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-upgrade-wizard/research/2024-Review-Flow/research-findings.md#L373))
  - Quote: “I might try to get help for somebody to explain [the prior service question] to me.” (p5)
- **Results page feels overwhelming.** ([Line 487](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-upgrade-wizard/research/2024-Review-Flow/research-findings.md#L487))
  - Quote: “It’s a long page, so maybe if there was a way to collapse more of the page to bring it down.” (p14)
- **Assistive technology users found the wizard accessible.** ([Line 670](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-upgrade-wizard/research/2024-Review-Flow/research-findings.md#L670))
  - Quote: “It’s going to be accessible for a visually impaired Veteran.” (p7)
- **Veterans prefer digital submission options.** ([Line 583](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-upgrade-wizard/research/2024-Review-Flow/research-findings.md#L583))
  - Quote: “It’s too bad that you can’t do it online.” (p4)

## Between the lines
While the wizard performs well in guiding Veterans through tasks, the branching logic and content could benefit from clearer language and additional visual cues to reduce cognitive load.

## Yes, but
Not all participants noticed alerts or understood how their answers influenced branching logic, indicating a gap in how feedback is communicated within the flow.

## Why it matters
This research supports OCTO-DE’s mission to enhance Veterans’ digital experiences by ensuring tools like the Discharge Upgrade Wizard are intuitive, accessible, and aligned with their needs. Improving this flow can help Veterans access vital benefits more easily.
