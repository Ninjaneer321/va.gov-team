## Research Goals
The Discharge Upgrade Wizard is part of the unauthenticated experience and uses a wizard pattern to guide Veterans through an optimized series of questions to help them determine how to apply for a discharge upgrade. 

There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Attending to health needs)
- Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)
- Retiring (Taking care of my health, Finding additional sources of income)
- Aging (Managing my declining health, Planning for long term care)

The purpose of this research is to find out whether we’ve met these goals:

- Veterans can understand how to edit an answer that introduces branching logic and navigate back to the review page.
- Veterans can understand why they may be asked additional questions when editing an answer to a particular question.
- After editing a question, updates to the review page are clear and easy for Veterans to understand.
- Veterans can navigate through the entire flow using the subtask pattern with ease.
- Veterans that use assistive technology, like screen readers or screen magnifier technology, can navigate through user flows with ease.

## Research Questions

1. What feedback do Veterans have on editing questions with branching logic?
2. What feedback do Veterans have on the entire edit flow?
     - Alerts on question and results pages
     - Back and Continue button functionality
3. What feedback do Veterans have after the review page has been updated with new questions and answers?
4. Do Veterans understand how their answers relate to their results?

## Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated usability testing over Zoom from October 22-November 7, 2024 to observe research participants using the Discharge Upgrade Wizard in a live coded environment (staging) with the updated sub task pattern. This allowed us to use the current branching logic and our experimental edit flow pattern.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The edit flow is simple enough for Veterans to understand and the actions in this flow are what they expect.
   - TRUE: All participants were able to navigate the edit flow with no difficulty. 
2. Veterans will understand that they may be asked to answer additional questions.
   - LIKELY TRUE: Most participants didn't comment on additional questions being asked, but were able to edit questions with ease. Some participants noticed the alert on question pages that indicated more may be asked.
3. Veterans will understand the updated review page and how it relates to the questions they answered.
   - LIKELY TRUE: Most participants didn't comment on updated answers on the review screen and continued to the results page with no questions. Some participants noticed the alert on the review page that their answer was updated.
4. Veterans will understand how their answers relate to their results.
   - MOSTLY TRUE: Most participants understood the purpose of the results page and the information it provided. One participant expressed that the information on the page was very general and not specific to the discharge upgrade reason they gave.
5. Veterans will find the content of the questions relevant to their understanding of a Discharge Upgrade and how it applies to them.
   - MOSTLY TRUE: Most participants didn't comment on the questions or felt that they were clear. Some participants found a couple of the questions confusing or lacking information.
