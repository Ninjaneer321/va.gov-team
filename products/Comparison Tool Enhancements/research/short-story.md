# Usability Insights for the GI Bill Comparison Tool

*Research findings from the GI Bill Comparison Tool Specialized Mission Filter Study*

## tl;dr (too long, didn’t read)

This study revealed usability challenges with the GI Bill Comparison Tool, particularly with filter usage and understanding. While the tool is user-friendly, participants faced difficulties selecting effective filters and interpreting their results.

## What we did

The govcio-vfep team conducted 30-minute remote usability sessions from September 25–29, 2023. The research aimed to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of filters within the GI Bill Comparison Tool and gather user feedback to improve the tool’s design.

## Key insights

- **Users struggle to select and interpret filters effectively.** ([Line 140](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Comparison%20Tool%20Enhancements/research/GIBCT_Specialized%20Mission%20Filter_govcio-vfep_Research%20Findings.md#L140))
  - Quote: “I don’t know the names of these schools, that is what I am trying to find out.”
  
- **Specialized Mission Filters (SMFs) are underutilized due to perceived limitations.** ([Line 130](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Comparison%20Tool%20Enhancements/research/GIBCT_Specialized%20Mission%20Filter_govcio-vfep_Research%20Findings.md#L130))
  - Quote: “I don’t think I would use the Specialized Mission Filters, but I will click on a couple of them.”

- **Users expect results even with minimal search input.** ([Line 171](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Comparison%20Tool%20Enhancements/research/GIBCT_Specialized%20Mission%20Filter_govcio-vfep_Research%20Findings.md#L171))
  - Quote: “If I want to know where all of the HBCUs are, I assume that these are only eligible schools [GI eligible].”

- **Geographic filtering needs enhancement.** ([Line 195](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Comparison%20Tool%20Enhancements/research/GIBCT_Specialized%20Mission%20Filter_govcio-vfep_Research%20Findings.md#L195))
  - Quote: “I can’t expand the search for more than 75 miles – maybe expand the options to the entire US.”

- **The tool is user-friendly but requires users to know what they are looking for.** ([Line 210](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Comparison%20Tool%20Enhancements/research/GIBCT_Specialized%20Mission%20Filter_govcio-vfep_Research%20Findings.md#L210))
  - Quote: “Navigation [was] very, very easy.”

## Between the lines

Participants appreciated the tool’s functionality but lacked awareness of how to maximize its features. Misconceptions about how filters work and limited geographic options hindered their experience.

## Yes, but

While the tool is user-friendly, it assumes users already know what they are searching for. This may alienate users who are exploring options without specific institutions in mind.

## Why it matters

This research supports the VA’s mission to enhance veterans’ access to educational opportunities by ensuring tools like the GI Bill Comparison Tool are intuitive and effective. Improvements align with OCTO’s Key Results (KRs) to deliver user-centric digital experiences.

## What’s next

- Add search tips above search tabs and accordion drop-downs to guide users.
- Enable searches without predefined inputs to broaden usability.
- Expand geographic filter options to include nationwide results.
- Enhance visibility and clarity of Specialized Mission Filters.
