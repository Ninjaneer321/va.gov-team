# Research Plan Metadata
title: "Research Plan for ICAM Non-VA.gov Okta Users, May 2025"
date: 2025-05-01
last_updated: 2025-05-01
team: "Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM)"
product: "Single Sign-On (SSO) - Non-VA.gov Okta Users"
product_area: "authenticated"

# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "The VA is implementing a cloud-based Single Sign-On solution for centralized authentication. Understanding the experiences and needs of non-VA.gov users who authenticate via Okta is critical for ensuring seamless integration and user satisfaction across the VA ecosystem."
  product_location: "VA workforce and external user authentication systems (non-VA.gov applications)"
  user_familiarity: "Existing Okta authentication users outside of VA.gov context"
  product_brief_url: "https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/single-sign-on"

# Research Design
methodology: "Semi-structured interviews"
research_format: 
  location: remote
  in_person_details:
    facility: "N/A"
    point_of_contact: "N/A"
    equipment: "N/A"
  moderated: true
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand the authentication experiences of non-VA.gov Okta users"
  - goal_2: "Identify pain points and barriers in the current Okta authentication flow"
  - goal_3: "Gather insights to inform ICAM modernization efforts for diverse user groups"

research_questions:
  - "What are the authentication experiences of users accessing VA applications outside of VA.gov?"
  - "What challenges do non-VA.gov Okta users encounter during authentication?"
  - "How do user expectations differ between VA.gov and non-VA.gov authentication experiences?"
  - "What improvements would enhance the authentication experience for non-VA.gov users?"

hypotheses:
  - "Non-VA.gov Okta users will have different expectations and experiences than VA.gov users"
  - "Authentication challenges will vary based on the type of application being accessed"
  - "Users will identify opportunities for improved consistency across VA authentication experiences"

expected_outcomes: "This research will inform ICAM modernization efforts by providing insights into the diverse needs of non-VA.gov users, helping to ensure that SSO solutions work effectively across the entire VA ecosystem."

# Recruitment & Participants
recruitment:
  recruiting_partner: "Internal - User lists and application access data"
  approach: "Targeted recruitment of non-VA.gov Okta users"
  
  primary_criteria:

  secondary_criteria:
    - "Mix of workforce and external users"
    - "Varying frequency of authentication"
    - "Different device types used for access"
    
  screener_questions:
    - question: "Do you regularly access VA applications that are NOT VA.gov using Okta authentication?"
      qualifying_response: "Yes"
