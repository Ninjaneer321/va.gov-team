# **Research Plan for ICAM SSOi Pre-Migration, July 2025**

## Background 🏗️

**The VA is enhancing its modernization efforts by implementing a cloud-based Single Sign-On (SSO) solution for centralized authentication. This solution aims to complement current security standards, ensure easy integration, and provide a seamless experience for both workforce and external users. The modernization efforts are designed to be inclusive of workforce users, veterans, beneficiaries, and other users accessing public-facing applications.**

**The Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) initiative is undergoing a significant transformation, with a focus on modernizing authentication, authorization, and user access experiences across the VA ecosystem. This strategic UX research initiative will help us understand how application owners are navigating the migration and integration process with ICAM.**

## Research Goals 🥅

1. Evaluate the effectiveness of current communication and documentation provided during ICAM migration. 
2. Identify patterns in user roles and responsibilities that influence their experiences and interactions with ICAM. 
3. Understand the expectations and perceptions of success among application owners regarding ICAM migration. 
4. Alignment to deliver reusable, insight-driven assets. 

**Outcome**

This research will inform user type personas for application owners, application managers, and technical POCs to understand the user needs and pain points to improve ICAM migration efforts. 

**Research questions**

1. What have partners experienced when implementing SiteMinder IdP, and how have those experiences shaped their expectations of the EntraID migration? 
2. How well do partners understand the scope, process, and implications of migrating to EntraID? 
3. What concerns, barriers, and risks do partners perceive in the migration from SiteMinder to EntraID? 
4. What expectations and requirements do partners have to ensure a smooth and successful migration? 

**Hypothesis**

1. Most application owners will report no issues with the migration request process. 
2. Applications owners will identify communication and documentation as key factors in their migration experience. 

## Methodology 🛠️

We will conduct semi-structured interviews.

### Location

Interviews will be conducted remotely via Teams.

## Research materials 📔

## Recruitment 🎯

We will be recruiting applications owners, managers, and technical POCs.

**Recruitment approach**

We will leverage lists of application owners, technical POCs, and engineers to identify application users to speak with, also the integration survey.
