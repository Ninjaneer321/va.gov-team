# **Research Plan for ICAM SSOi Mid-Migration, August 2025**

## Background 🏗️

**The VA is enhancing its modernization efforts by implementing a cloud-based Single Sign-On (SSO) solution for centralized authentication. This solution aims to complement current security standards, ensure easy integration, and provide a seamless experience for both workforce and external users. The modernization efforts are designed to be inclusive of workforce users, veterans, beneficiaries, and other users accessing public-facing applications.**

**The Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) initiative is undergoing a significant transformation, with a focus on modernizing authentication, authorization, and user access experiences across the VA ecosystem. This strategic UX research initiative will help us understand how application owners are navigating the migration and integration process with ICAM.**

## Research Goals 🥅

1. Understand how well-informed partners feel before and during the ICAM migration process.
2. Determine whether the level, type, and timing of support provided meets partner teams’ needs.
3. Understand the main challenges partners encounter during the migration process.

**Outcome**

This research will inform user type personas for application owners, application managers, and technical POCs to understand the user needs and pain points to improve ICAM migration efforts.

**Research questions**

1. How well-informed do partners feel going into and during the migration process?
2. Does the level of support match the partner teams' needs?
3. What pain points have partners experienced during the migration process?

**Hypothesis**

1. Most application owners will report feeling uninformed prior to the kickoff meeting.
2. Most application owners will state that they feel well supported during the migration.

## Methodology 🛠️

We will conduct semi-structured interviews.

### Location

Interviews will be conducted remotely via Teams.

## Research materials 📔

- \[Conversation Guide\]

## Recruitment 🎯

We will be recruiting applications owners, managers, and technical POCs.

**Recruitment approach**

We will leverage lists of application owners, technical POCs, and engineers to identify application users to speak with, also the integration survey.

## Sessions

#### Research sessions

- Planned dates of research: August, 2025.

#### Length of sessions

- Session length: **30 minutes**

## Team Roles

- **Moderator**: Anne Kennedy
- **Research guide writing and task development**: Anne Kennedy
- **Participant recruiting & screening**: Anne Kennedy
- **Project point of contact**: Anne Kennedy
- **Note-takers**: TBD
- **Observers**: Joel Calumpong, Shannon Yeaker, Jason Hunt, Sherry Smith
