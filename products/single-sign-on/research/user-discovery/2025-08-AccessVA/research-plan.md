# Research Plan for ICAM SSOe Access VA Business Partner Discovery, August 2025

## Background 🏗️

The VA is enhancing its modernization efforts by implementing a cloud-based Single Sign-On (SSO) solution for centralized authentication. This solution aims to complement current security standards, ensure easy integration, and provide a seamless experience for both workforce and external users. The modernization efforts are designed to be inclusive of workforce users, veterans, beneficiaries, and other users accessing public-facing applications. 

The Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) initiative is undergoing a significant transformation, with a focus on modernizing authentication, authorization, and user access experiences across the VA ecosystem. This strategic UX research initiative will help us understand how application owners are navigating the migration and integration process with ICAM.
