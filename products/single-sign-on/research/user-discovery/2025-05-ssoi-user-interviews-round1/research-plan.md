# **Research Plan for ICAM Single Sign-On User Interviews (Veteran), May 2025**

## Background 🏗️

**The VA is enhancing its modernization efforts by implementing a cloud-based Single Sign-On (SSO) solution for centralized authentication. This solution aims to complement current security standards, ensure easy integration, and provide a seamless experience for both workforce and external users. The modernization efforts are designed to be inclusive of workforce users, veterans, beneficiaries, and other users accessing public-facing applications.**

Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)

**ICAM SSO is an authentication service.**

What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

**OCTO-DE Priorities**

Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

Objective 1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

- **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
- **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

Objective 2: OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.

- **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.
- **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.
- **Key Result 4:** Each of our platforms\* and tools increase the number of non-OCTO built capabilities or non-OCTO users by 50%. (\*excluding mobile)

Objective 3: OCTO teammates are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact.

- **Key Result 1:** Team members reporting more than a reasonable amount of stress is 5 points lower for each quarter in 2025 than it was in the corresponding quarter in 2024.
- **Key Result 3:** 75% or more team members are confident they have the knowledge needed to make effective decisions.

Objective 4: OCTO positively influences VA's ability to deliver software products and services faster, safer, and with higher quality.

- **Key Result 3:** Five or more non-OCTO teams have used SPRUCE to deliver high quality software.

## Research Goals 🥅

1. Understand how users interact with ICAM (SSO).
2. Surface any pain points users experience interacting with ICAM (SSO).
3. Discover differences and similarities among the user types.

**Outcome**

This research will inform user type personas for Veterans, caregivers, beneficiaries, alt-MFA users, and non-Veteran SSOe users, and help inform user journey and service design efforts.

**Research questions**

1. What is the nature of Veterans’, caregivers’, delegates’, Service members’ or beneficiaries’ interaction with ICAM (SSO)?
2. What pain points do users experience while interacting with ICAM (SSO)?
3. What are the differences and commonalities among the various user types?

**Hypothesis**

Hypothesis 1: Many participants' expressed pain points will be with difficulty in understanding the process of how to obtain access to the needed services.

Hypothesis 2: Most differences among the user types will be between the Veteran and non-Veteran groupings.
