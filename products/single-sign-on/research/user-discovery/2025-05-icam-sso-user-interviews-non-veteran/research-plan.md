# Research plan for ICAM Single Sign-On User Interviews (Non-Veteran) May 2025
## Background 🏗️

**The VA is enhancing its modernization efforts by implementing a cloud-based Single Sign-On (SSO) solution for centralized authentication. This solution aims to complement current security standards, ensure easy integration, and provide a seamless experience for both workforce and external users. The modernization efforts are designed to be inclusive of workforce users, veterans, beneficiaries, and other users accessing public-facing applications.**

`Objective 2: OCTO’s platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

> - **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.
> - **Key Result 4:** Each of our platforms* and tools increase the number of non-OCTO built capabilities or non-OCTO users by 50%. (*excluding mobile)

`Objective 3: OCTO teammates are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact.`

> - **Key Result 1:** Team members reporting more than a reasonable amount of stress is 5 points lower for each quarter in 2025 than it was in the corresponding quarter in 2024.
> - **Key Result 3:** 75% or more team members are confident they have the knowledge needed to make effective decisions.

`Objective 4: OCTO positively influences VA's ability to deliver software products and services faster, safer, and with higher quality.`

### Research questions

**`1.`What is the nature of users' interaction with ICAM (SSO) in their current role?***
