# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "Between 5 and 7 VBA Regional Office facilities will be involved in the launch of the MVP for publishing VBA facility information in Drupal. The MVP seeks to uncover situations unique to VBA facilities that may require new research, change management planning, product development, and user testing before the full roll-out to all VBA facilities. We need to understand the context for event- and staff-related information, situational updates related to a facility, and how web editors prioritize and understand the website as a service delivery channel."

research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand from CMS editors' perspectives the context for event- and staff-related information"
  - goal_2: "Understand how CMS editors handle situational updates related to a facility"
  - goal_3: "Understand how web editors for a facility prioritize the publishing of facility information on the website, understand the website as a service delivery channel, and want to learn how to use Drupal CMS"

research_questions:
  - "How do editors get their facility's operating status and visitor and event information to put on the website? How often do they update this information?"
  - "What is the process for publishing situational updates?"
  - "What are editors' priorities in relation to making facility information available?"
  - "What are editors' understanding of the website as a service delivery channel? Do they have any feedback on the website?"
  - "What are editors' overall comfort level with technology and content management systems in particular?"
  - "How might we help users learn about Drupal CMS?"
  - "What tasks should be included on the VBA editor dashboard?"

hypotheses:

  - "VBA editors will have similar needs to Vet Center editors who moved to Drupal CMS starting in 2021, based on the similar scope of facility content and knowledge of CMS tools for web publishing"

# Research Plan for VBA MVP Editor-facing Discovery – August 2022

## Background
Between 5 and 7 VBA Regional Office (RO) facilities will be involved in the launch of the [Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for publishing VBA facility information](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vagov-cms-team-5c0e7b864b5806bc2bfc2087/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/10191) in Drupal starting in late 2022/early 2023.

The MVP will give the designated CMS editors a basic set of functionality to publish information about their facility operations on VA.gov so Veterans can successfully plan their next visit and perform other key tasks.

While some of this functionality has been developed and tested with other VA editors and Veterans, the MVP seeks to uncover any situations unique to VBA facilities that may require new research, change management planning, product development, and user testing before, during, and after the full roll-out to all VBA facilities starting in [2023](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vagov-cms-team-5c0e7b864b5806bc2bfc2087/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/10185).
 
## OCTO objectives
### North Star
* Increase the quality and reliability of VA services 

### Goal
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information 

### Numbers
* Increase usage of digital, self- service tools
* Decrease call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

## Research goals
The primary goals of this research are to understand from the perspectives of CMS editors the context for:
* Event- and staff-related information
* Situational updates related to a facility

Secondary goals include collecting supplemental feedback for how web editors for a facility:
* Prioritize the publishing of facility information on the website
* Understand the website as a service delivery channel
* Want to learn how to use Drupal CMS

This research will follow a [related effort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/research/2022-8-veteran-facing/research-plan.md) to understand the needs of Veterans when visiting a VBA facility and getting services.

## Outcomes
The results of this research will be used to develop recommendations for OCTO-DE to inform a future direction for:
* A task-based CMS dashboard for authenticated VBA editors
* Development of the VBA facility product
* The change management strategy and plan for the MVP and the full rollout of the CMS to all VBA facilities
* The training plan for the MVP and the full rollout
* Future research for the VBA project

## Hypotheses
1. The new Drupal CMS facilities product will address 508 compliance while the associated change management approach, training, and user support will create a positive experience for the MVP editors. 
2. VBA editors will have similar needs to Vet Center editors who moved to Drupal CMS starting in 2021, based on the similar scope of facility content and knowledge of CMS tools for web publishing.

## Research Questions
* How do editors get their facility’s operating status and visitor and event information to put on the website? How often do they update this information?
* What is the process for publishing situational updates?
* What are editors’ priorities in relation to making facility information available?
* What are editors’ understanding of the website as a service delivery channel? Do they have any feedback on the website?
* What are editors’ overall comfort level with technology and content management systems in particular?
* How might we help users learn about Drupal CMS?
* What tasks should be included on the VBA editor dashboard? 
  
## Method
* Semi-structured interviews 
  
## Location
* Remote, via Zoom 
  
## Research materials
* [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/research/VBA-discovery/VBA-business-discovery-conversation_guide.md) 

## Recruitment
The CMS Facilities team will work with the OCTO-DE product owner to recruit 10-14 VBA staff for this research using the the following criteria:
  * Are at a Regional Office chosen for the MVP
  * Have a range of experience with web publishing
  
## Timeline (TBD, for discussion)
* September 2022: finalize research plans and conversation guides
* October: complete research interviews
* October: synthesize research
* November: report findings and recommendations for design  
  
## Research sessions
Month Day – Month Day, 2022 (TBD)

## Length of sessions
* 30-45 minutes each
* 20 minutes buffer time between sessions
* 15 minutes after each session for research team debrief
