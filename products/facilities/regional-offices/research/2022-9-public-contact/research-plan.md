# Background Context
background:
  problem_statement: "7 VBA Regional Office facilities will be involved in the launch of the MVP for publishing VBA facility information in Drupal. The Public Contact staff at these facilities provide front-line support to Veterans. We need to interview Public Contact staff to better understand the Veteran experience and service delivery models at the MVP Regional Office sites, including common tasks Veterans attempt to complete, typical Veteran experiences (successes, expectations, frustrations), and service delivery models for facilities."
  product_location: "VA.gov - VBA Regional Office facility pages"
  user_familiarity: "New product - MVP for VBA Regional Offices"
  product_brief_url: "https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/design"

# Research Design
methodology: "semi-structured interviews"
research_format: 
  location: remote
  moderated: true
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand from Public Contact staff perspectives the service delivery model for the facility (or group of facilities) for a geographic area"
  - goal_2: "Understand common tasks Veterans attempt to complete during in-person visits"
  - goal_3: "Understand the typical Veteran experience (successes, expectations, frustrations, complaints) at these facilities"

research_questions:
  - "What benefit-related services are offered at these facilities? How do services differ by benefit types? Are any services shared across benefit types? Are all services available consistently throughout the week? Do any services require referrals to other facilities? Are there any services unique to this region/facility?"
  - "What do Veterans typically try to accomplish during an in-person facility visit? What are the most/least common tasks? Can these tasks be accomplished other ways (phone, web)? How complicated are these common tasks? How do Public Contact Staff assist Veterans? Any regionally specific needs? Any problems?"
  - "What is the typical Veteran experience when visiting these facilities? Typical wait times? Busier days or time? Appointments vs walk-ins? Common frustrations? Complaints? How Veterans usually arrive at the facility? How long does it take for a Veteran to travel to a facility?"
  - "What do Veterans need to know or do to be adequately prepared for a visit? Does this differ by service? Could they have found that information on the website? Most common thing Veterans are missing?"

hypotheses:
  - "The existing VBA service taxonomy does not accurately reflect the breadth of benefit-related tasks that can be accomplished at Regional Benefit Offices"
  - "A more robust VBA service taxonomy could increase Veteran self-service and help Veterans be fully prepared for visits to Regional Benefit Offices"
  - "The typical Veteran experience at Regional Benefit Offices is generally positive"

expected_outcomes: "The results will be used to develop recommendations for OCTO-DE to inform: development of the VBA Regional Office facility product, the scope of the Regional Office product and what other facilities may be included, the plan for the MVP and the full rollout of the CMS to all VBA Regional Office facilities, future research for the VBA project, and insights from front-line Public Contact staff in other possible areas where a website, data, or self-service mechanisms may be incorporated in a possible roadmap"

# Research Plan for VBA MVP Public Contact Staff Interviews

## Background
7 Veteran Benefit Administration (VBA) Regional Office (RO) facilities will be involved in the launch of the [Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for publishing VBA facility information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/design) in Drupal starting in late 2022/early 2023.

The MVP will give the designated CMS editors a basic set of functionality to publish information about their facility operations on VA.gov so Veterans can successfully plan their next visit and perform other key tasks.

The Public Contact staff at these facilities provide front-line support to Veterans. We plan to interview a sample of Public Contact staff to better understand the Veteran experience and service delivery models at the MVP Regional Office sites.
 
## OCTO objectives
### North Star
* Increase the quality and reliability of VA services 

### Goal
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information 

### Numbers
* Increase usage of digital, self- service tools
* Decrease call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

## Research goals
Understand from the perspectives of the Public Contact staff:
* Service delivery model for the facility (or group of facilities) for a geographic area
* Common tasks Veterans attempt to complete during in-person visits
* The typical Veteran experience (successes, expectations, frustrations, complaints) at these facilities 

## Outcomes
The results of this research will be used to develop recommendations for OCTO-DE to inform a future direction for:
* Development of the VBA Regional Office facility product
* The scope of the Regional Office product and what, if any, other facilities may be included in the scope (e.g. Satellite Regional Offices, Veteran Readiness Offices, etc)
* The plan for the MVP and the full rollout of the CMS to all VBA Regional Office facilities
* Future research for the VBA project
* Gain insights from the front-line Public Contact staff in other possible areas where a website, data, or self-service mechanisms may be incorporated in a possible roadmap of the Regional Office product or other product roadmaps

## Hypotheses
* The existing [VBA service taxonomy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/services-taxonomy#original-list-of-services) does not accurately refelct the breadth of benefit-related tasks that can be accomplished at Regional Benefit Offices
* A more robust VBA service taxonomy could increase Veteran self-service and help Veterans be fully prepared for visits to Regional Benefit Offices
* The typical Veteran experience at Regional Benefit Offices is generally positive

## Research Questions

1. What benefit-related **services are offered** at these facilities?
   * How do services differ by benefit types? 
   * Are any services shared across benefit types (e.g. updating contact info)?
   * Are all services available consistently throughout the week?
   * Do any services require referrals to other facilities?
   * Are there any services unique to this region/facility?

2. What do Veterans typically **try to accomplish** during an in-person facility visit?
   * What are the most common tasks they complete?
   * What are the least common tasks?
   * Can these tasks be accomplished other ways (phone, web)?
     * If so, why do Veterans do this task in-person?
   * How complicated are these common tasks?
   * How do Public Contact Staff assist Veterans in these tasks?
   * Any regionally specific needs (e.g. state or region specific support, translation)?
   * Any problems?
     * Tasks unable to complete
     * Tasks that Veterans usually get hung up on
     * Frustrations expressed by Veterans
     * How frequently are these problems encountered?

3. What is the **typical Veteran experience** when visiting these facilities?
   *	Typical wait times?
   *	Busier days or time?
   *	Appointments vs walk-ins?
   *	Common frustrations? Complaints?
   *	How Veterans usually arrive at the facility? (drive, public transit?) 
   *	How long does it take for a Veteran to travel to a facility

4. What do Veterans need to know or do to be adequately **prepared** for a visit?
   * Does this differ by service? 
   * Could they have found that information on the website?
   * Most common thing Veterans are missing?
  
## Method
* Semi-structured interviews 
  
## Location
* Remote, via Zoom
