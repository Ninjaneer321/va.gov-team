This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

# Key Findings

1. Veterans want to speak with a human when they are discovering what’s possible.
2. Veterans want to complete tasks online when tasks are clear.
3. Problems encountered were never really connected to VBA website content issues.

# Details of Findings

Finding #1: Veterans want to speak with a human when they are discovering what’s possible.

* Doesn't like being treated like a number.

  * Veterans want to know that their concerns matter to who they are speaking with.
  * Veterans express a perception that their concerns get lost in the shuffle of bureaucracy. This may stem from a lack of clear information on their application status.
* Veterans don’t trust automated systems such as webpages or phone tree systems, and express feeling frustration when interacting with those systems.
* Questions are dynamic and complex and not easily slotted into reviewing an FAQ page online.
* Questions are often exploratory “What benefits can I get?”, “Can I use my education benefits to start a new career?”
* Veterans want the trust that comes from a real human speaking with them.

"It's faster to just go in and hand them a paper form" -p5

Finding #2: Veterans want to complete tasks online when tasks are clear.

* 10/12 rated online 1st preference for completing task.
  * Tasks include things like raising their disability rating, securing a home loan, seeking funding for further education.
* Convenience was frequently stressed.
* Veterans want up to date access to all their paperwork and forms, and the status of everything.
* 4/12 rated phones as their second preference and 7/12 rated as 3rd preference.
* People do not want to call because they feel like they never can find the right person and are easier to deflect

“When I call I just get stuck in a phone tree” -p4

”If they offer it online, I would do it online. I do everything online. I have done request for records online, and that is way easier because before you had to go to the VA.” -p4

Finding #3: Veterans encountered problems with authenticated experience.

* No one reported any difficulties finding hours or location information on the VA website
* Veterans reported problems with difficulty logging in, tracking the status of their applications, submitting applications digitally, which are all authenticated parts of the website.

”I was looking to see if they could get me a copy of my case file, but they can not do that. I was trying to find out if my disability was static and the folks wanted nothing to do with me. I felt like I was interrupting their conversation that had nothing to do with the VA.” - p13

Finding #4: Veterans found the information they wanted on the VBA website or Google Maps.

* No one reported any difficulties finding hours or location information on the VA website
* Veterans often didn’t check the VA websites, and instead relied solely on Google Maps.

”I had been there before because it is in the Satellite Office in the Department of Labor I had been there before when I got laid off. I Googled map to remind me of where it is at. Satellite I have in my phone, so I just had to click on the contact info and it popped up in my Google Maps.” - p9

Finding #5: Veterans expect Benefit Centers to be “one stop shops” for services.

* Only 1/12 Veterans interviewed expressed interest in knowing what specific services were available at the location they visited.
* Veterans preferred to get the location information and immediately go and walk in and start asking questions with a human.
* 9/12 Veterans visited a Regional Office and had no problems finding the services they needed.
* 1/12 visited an IDESS location but they already knew what specialized service they were pursuing.

”No, those guys are pretty good about all that stuff. When I set up the appointment, he had an idea of what I was coming in with. I asked him if I needed to bring anything in with me, he told me no. If he needed something he could request it online, very rarely did I need to come home and grab records from home. Whoever is setting up the appointment will tell me if I need to bring anything” - p9

Finding #6: Veterans demonstrated a sophisticated use of ad hoc social media communities to inform their relationship with the VA.

* A Veteran reported using a subreddit called VeteranBenefits to inform their seeking a Disability benefit upgrade.
* A Veteran reported following a Youtuber who was a disabled Veteran.

”I first found out about it on a subreddit, VeteranBenefits” - p13
