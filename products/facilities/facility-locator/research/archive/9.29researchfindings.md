# Research Summary

- Usability tested with 4 users 
- 9/29/16 - 9/30/16

## Overview - facility finder
- Most participants reported using Google as their starting place to find a VA phone number or facility.
 - Most participants said that their task usually ends with finding a phone number. 
 - Direct extensions are helpful to help avoid time and confusion of using a phone tree.
- Most participants were looking for specific **data** related to services. E.g., outpatient clinics. QUOTE: "If I was traveling, I need catheters and stuff like that -- so I might need to find an address where I can go and get it. Prescriptions - sometimes you're traveling and you lose a prescription on you run out. And oh, I like that it has service type. I see that it says health - but I'd love to have another drop down, you know -- like heart, or spinal cord -- because not all VAs do all the services."

- Current Version
 - Participants liked the legend but expected clicking it to filter what results they saw.
 - Some ended on specific VAMC sites looking at services.
 - One had to zoom out to find results when she searched by zip.
 - There was a glitch where a user double-clicked, the map zoomed to about a state-level, which showed an overwhelming amount of results

- New Prototype
 - Helpful with numbers, but also busy. Users could use more visual context than numbers to distinguish types of facilities.
 - Searched by city and zip code.
 - One missed "edit search" completely and some had issues finding it since it was collapsed. Some missed the dropdown to pick services, since it collapsed again after they entered their location and hit enter.
 - Participants liked the detail page a lot. One expected services to be clickable to see more information.
  
- The search options starting and returning to a collapsed state in the new version was challenging to several participants.
- Many people begin with a web search rather than seeking the official site to find locations (stores, libraries, etc).
- Observation: the scroll for the results new design is not easy to use.

### Top findings from each session:
#### Bill
Would like to see more services in detail because not all VA medical centers have the same services. 
#### Nicki
Wants to extension of each office because everything has a central line.
#### Nathan
User would like to see specific phone numbers. "I've been transferred around so many times and wish there were just one number to begin with."
