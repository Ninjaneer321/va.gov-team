# Research Plan: Urgent Care Mashup Study 

**July 2020 Discovery**<br>

## Goals
The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of new facility locator search result cards which combine VA urgent care and community urgent care service types.

#### Research questions

- What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking urgent care?
- What information do Veterans need/want for community urgent care (in VA network) locations?
- Do Veterans need to distinguish between these location types in a single list?
- Do veterans want to filter by facility type, va/non-va?
- Would veterans click to learn more about community urgent care benefits? 
- Do veterans find labels such as those indicating urgent care service/facility type helpful when finding/selecting an urgent care location?
- What information does a veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a urgent care facility?

#### Hypothesis 
- Veterans will understand how to find an urgent care location.
- Veterans will want to filter urgent care locations by facility type, va/non-va to inform their decision.
- Veterans will understand how to prepare for a visit to an urgent care facility.

## Method

Remote, moderated usability testing will be used to gain feedback on the design of facility locator search result that will combine cards for VA urgent care and community urgent care. The study will validate that the new designs will allow:
 - participants to understand all of the urgent care facility options available to them.
 - validate that the new design would sufficiently inform them about community urgent care benefits.

We will be testing a [UXPin prototype] via Zoom. These sessions will include a short interview with the participant.

## Participants and recruitment

We will utilize the Perigean contract recruiting. We'd like to schedule 15 participants to reach our goal of observing **10** participants.

Participant Criteria:

- All genders
- A mix of rural and urban
- Veterans & Caregivers
- Enrolled in VA health care
- Has visited an urgent care clinic in the last two years
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person with cognitive disabilities
- Laptop or desktop computer
- Be able to screenshare via Zoom. Please confirm with them that they have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screenshare.
