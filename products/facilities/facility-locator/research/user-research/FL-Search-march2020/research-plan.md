# Research plan for facility locator user expectations for search
Prepared by Aricka Lewis, Ad Hoc | March 2020

## Goals	
The goal of this research is to understand users expectations for search results, including the following:

- how many results they expect to be returned for a healthcare related search
- how search results are impacted by geographic setting (urban/rural)
- what geographic area they would expect the map to show by default
- how they would expect to interact with the map to change their search results
- how facility type impacts expectations

### Background
Facility Locator is VA's single source of truth for customers to find VA facilities and location details about all VA facilities, across VHA, VBA, and NCA

### Research questions
- How does user interaction with the map and search results differ between urban and rural residents?
- What impact does facility or service type have on how participants interact with search results?
- How many search results should the facility locator display before pagination?
- How do participants utilize the map and search results together?
- How do particpants expect to refine their search results?

### Hypothesis	
- Rural participants will not want to see many return results if the facilities are far away
- Urban participants will want to see multiple locations and compare them by if they are close 
- Users will be looking for VAMC or VA locations first regarding healthcare related searches
- Rural participants may depend on landmarks and they may recognize non-VA locations easier

## Method	
- We will use Zoom to conduct remote moderated usability testing sessions to observe how participants use the live VA facility locator	
	
## Participants and Recruitment	
We will work with Perigean to reach our goal of observing **7-8** participants

Criteria for recruiting:
- 10 sessions scheduled
- Has used the VA facility locator
- All genders
- A mix of rural and urban 
- Veterans & Caregivers 
- Fits one of the following
	- Has used facility locator multiple times
	- Has cognitive disabilities
	- Has used used Community Care
	- Enrolled in VA health care

## Timeline 	
This study will take place from March 4 - 6, 2020.
Each session will be approximately 45 minutes.
