# VBA Service Naming Research, Round 1 (with SME's) 

VSA, Facilities Team<br>

Dave Sukharan, December 2021

View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/research/user-research/benefits-taxonomy-research-SME/research-plan-benefits-taxonomy-SME-interviews.md).

## Research Goals 

1. Evaluate the current VBA taxonomy against the mental models of users: names, scope, and categorization of services
2. Evaluate the list of benefits obtained from our survey of groups against the list of services offered in reality.
3. Detect missing services or context that will allow for better follow-up questions with users.
4. Understand the major pain points around accessing benefits to better be able to prepare for users’ stories.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 2 moderated interviews with subject matter experts (SME's)

- One single person interview with a VBA employee
- One group interview with 4 VBA employees and stakeholders

The structure of the study:

- Participants were asked a semi-structured list of questions and encouraged to discuss amongst themselves.

### Who we talked to

The main participants in this study were:

- Alexis Bravo - Field Offices
- Lori Ehlers - Office of Field Operations
- Tanekwa S. Bournes - VBAVACO

### Research Questions

*Evaluate the current VBA taxonomy against the mental models of users: names, scope, and categorization of services*

- What are the most common benefits that Veterans and caregivers (users) ask for assistance with?
- Are there services that you believe should be rephrased or renamed?
- Are there any service categories that encompass many different/disparate services?

*Evaluate the list of benefits obtained from our survey of groups against the list of services offered in reality.*

- What are some of the lesser known benefits available to users?
- Compare and contrast the benefits listed to those available in reality.

*Detect missing services or context that will allow for better follow-up questions with users.*

- Do users primarily access their services via in-person, phone, or other interactions?
- Do the services that users need assistance with differ by any patterns: age, time out of service, gender, caregiver vs veteran status, etc.
- Are there any changes or trends on the horizon (or recently) in the benefits that are being offered or how they are being offered?

*Understand the major pain points around accessing benefits to better be able to prepare for users’ stories.*

- What are common pain points for users in the benefits process?
- When users are most upset about benefits interactions, what is the cause?



## Key Findings

1. The current list of VBA services is primarily structured around VBA "business lines".
2. The tasks that are associated with each service are not exclusive: a single task can be mapped to multiple services.
3. Checking on active claims or active appeals processes are a common use case for in-person visits


## Details of Findings

### 1. The current list of VBA services is primarily structured around VBA business lines.

1. Within VBA, there are 8 business lines:
   1. List off eight services
2. Each business line is led by an accountable senior executive who is responsible for the quality and performance of the business line.  
3. Not all facilities offer the same services:
   1. "If you show up to a VSOC looking for Burial, you might not have good luck."
4. There are a group of benefits (education, IDES) that are pushed to transitioning vets by the Office of Transition.

### 2. The tasks that are associated with each service are not exclusive: a single task can be mapped to multiple services.

1. Applying for Benefits is one of the current VBA service names. Many veteran tasks could be classified under this service.
   1. "I can get Education Claims Assistance, but what IS Education Claim Assistance? What does it include as opposed to just Education?"
   2. Recommendation: Group and phrase the benefits by more generic terms: Housing, Education, etc.
   3. Family Member Claim Assistance: Helps family of (usually deceased) vets access benefits usually pertaining to compensation. This can also apply to education.

### 3. Checking on active claims or active appeals processes are a common use case for in-person visits

1. Disputing claims and checking on active claims are the most common use case for in-person visits to the VA.	
2. Vocational Rehab used to offer in-person counseling to a lot of users. They have now transitioned to a differrent modality: video calls.
   1. A lot of systems have shifted to a virtual environment: WaitWhile or VERA.



## Additional Insights

* Vocational Rehabilitation Employment is being renamed to Veteran Readiness and Employment.
  * The acronym of VR&E will stay the same.
* Offices are making changes to modalities in order to address pandemic concerns - many services have shifted to video calls. There is a debate on how to scale and approve this modality.

## Recommendations

- Conduct more exploratory/usability type research with users rather than heavily quantitative/card sort research
- Follow-up with these VBA employees and stakeholders to workshop on the results as buy-in from the field will be vital to any changes
