# Research Plan: Emergency Care Mashup Study 

## Background

The current Facility Locator tool does not contain an 'emergency care' option. The new option "In-network emergency care" is being added to the 'Facility type' search dropdown. "In-network" refers only to VA locations and community partners, and "in-network" search results are not comprehensive: there may be additional facilities that do not appear in the list. Additional search options are being added to the 'Service type' dropdown, returning results that include a combined list of VA and non-VA locations, as well as separate VA, and non-VA, results lists.

## Goals
The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of new facility locator search results that will combine cards for VA emergency care and community emergency care. The study will validate that the new designs will allow:
 - participants to understand all of the emergency care facility options available to them
 - validate that the new design would sufficiently inform them about community care emergency benefits
 - participants to understand what "in-network" means in terms of VA and non-VA community partners

#### Hypotheses

- Veterans want to search for a single list, containing both VA and community emergency care options
- Veterans understand they can go to any local emergency room, not just those in the results list
- Veterans understand that the Facility Locator list contains "in-network" VA and community care facilities, and is not comprehensive: it may not represent all emergency options available to them.
- The facility type label "In-network emergency care" does not introduce confusion about other facility types
- Veterans understand how to learn more about community care emergency benefit (explained elsewhere: https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/Emergency_Care.asp)
- Participants will understand what to do in case of emergency.

#### Research questions

- What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?
- What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?
- Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?
- Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?
- Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?
- What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

## Method

Remote, moderated usability testing will be used to gain feedback. 

We will be testing a [UXPin prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/8767aa9028468a26be090fd044d9ff26e40a8f95#/pages//simulate/no-panels?mode=i) via Zoom. These sessions will include a short interview with the participant.

## Participants and recruitment

We will utilize the Perigean contract recruiting. We'd like to schedule 15 participants to reach our goal of observing **10** participants.

Participant Criteria:

- **Must have:**
    - Enrolled in VA healthcare
    - Laptop or desktop computer
    - Be able to screenshare via Zoom. Please confirm with them that they have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screenshare.

- **Good to have:**
    - All genders
    - A mix of rural and urban
    - Veterans & Caregivers
    - At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
    - At least one person with cognitive disabilities
