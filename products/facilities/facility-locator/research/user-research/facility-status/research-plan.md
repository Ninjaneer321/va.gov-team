# Research Plan for Facility Operating Status - June 2020

## Goals
There is no standard way to define the current facility operating statuses provided on the Facility Locator. This leads to inconsistencies when relaying information to Veterans.

#### Research questions
- What terminology is helpful for Veterans to understand a facility's operating status?
- What events impact a facility's status?
- How do Veterans understand the current messaging/categorization of statuses?
- How do Veterans categorize various events that affect a facility's operating status?
- How might we create consistent messaging to Veterans across VA (VHA, Vet Centers, etc.)?
- How do virtual services fit into facility operating statuses?
- How much do people trust the operating statuses?
- How do people currently get information on facility operating hours/status?

#### Hypothesis 
- Veterans will not understand what service/access they can receive through the current status messaging
- Veterans want a clear understanding of a facility's operating status
- Veterans will only want to know when a facility's normal operation is impacted, regardless of facility type
- Veterans want to know what service/access they can receive upon viewing a facility's operating status

## Method
Moderated card sort, INSERT OPTIMAL SORT LINK HERE

We will use Zoom and OptimalSort to conduct remote moderated card sorting sessions to observe how participants categorize different scenarios that affect facility operating statuses. These sessions will include a short interview with the participant.

## Participants and recruitment
We will utilize the Perigean contract to reach our goal of observing **10** participants for one hour sessions.

Criteria for recruiting:

- All genders
- A mix of rural and urban
- Veterans & Caregivers

## Timeline
This study will take place June 10 - 12, 2020
