	<summary> Details for unusually long response times in March 2024  </summary>

 The average load time in the month of March was negatively impacted by two known events which caused unusually long response times.

<details>
	<summary> Long response times were also noted YTD April 30, 2024  </summary>

Longer load times were disproportionately seen in Emergency care, Urgent care and Community care specialty code 101YM0800X (Counselor, Mental health).

Emergency care searches 
- March page load average = 19.91 sec 
- April page load average = 21.72 sec

Urgent care searches 
- March page load average = 5.12 sec 
- April page load average = 10.25 sec
  
Community care specialty code 101YM0800X 
- March page load average = 23.67 sec, due to a single day of poor performance on March 12 when the load time was 271.24 seconds.
- April page load average = 3.56 sec.

- Performance improved in mid to late April. We await May data before assessing trends.
