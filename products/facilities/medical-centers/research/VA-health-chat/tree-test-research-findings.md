## Research Goals

1. The main goal of this study is to identify where Veterans expect contact methods for their healthcare team to be located on VAMC pages.

2. A secondary goal of the study is to identitfy where Veterans expect to find help accessing and using VA health chat and VA health connect. 

## Methodology 

**IA Tree Test (remote, unmoderated)**
Using Optimal Workshop, we conducted an unmoderated study in which participants were invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants were sent a link to a tree test activity that contained 6 tasks. For each task, the participant was asked to locate in the menu tree where they believe a specific task can be completed. The results of the tree test will help inform optimal placement of health chat and health connect links on VAMC pages. Links to VA Health Chat and VA Health Connect were placed in various places within the tree structure so we could identify where participants navigated to most often.  


## Hypothesis and Conclusion

**1. Most participants will be able to identify and locate methods of communication on facility health care pages.**
  - _Definitely true._  - Participants primarily navigated to the Make an Appointment, Contact Us, or Manage your health online for all 6 tasks. 


## Key Findings

1. Participants primarily navigated to "Make an Appointment" when presented with tasks related to making an appointment via online chat, scheduling a future appointment after hours, or scheduling telehealth. (Tasks: 1, 2, and 6)
2. When presented with calling to refill a prescription, most expected to be able to find this on the "Contact us" page. (Task 3)
3. When presented with using online chat to refill a prescription, participants primarily navigated to "Manage your healthcare online". (Task 4)
4. Participants initially looked to speak to a healthcare provider after hours in "Contact us" but a significant portion navigated back to "Manage your healthcare online" and "Make an appointment."
    - When selecting Contact Us, it's likely that participants are looking for this information to be near main contact info blocks


## Details of Task level Findings

Labels: BNFT: Healthcare, AUD: Veterans, AUD: Caregivers, AUD: Family Members, VETJNY: Taking care of themselves 
_List all labels from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

**1. Healthcare appointment using online chat - 49% , xx% directness**
    - The task was worded more towards being a caregiver, and the top answer was the PCAFC program selected in the family member hub (32%), the health care option was second (20%)
    - The task was worded as a spouse or caregiver, and the top answer was the health care option within the family member hub (50%)
    - 4 clicks to select PCAFC, 5 clicks to select health and disability programs
   
**2. After business hours, call to make a medical appointment - xx% task success, xx% directness**
  - This ta

**3. Refill a prescription over the phone - xx% task success, xx% directness**
  - This ta

**4. Refill a prescription with online chat - xx% task success, xx% directness**
  - This ta

**5. After business hours, talk to a health care provider - xx% task success, xx% directness**
  - This ta

**6. Schedule a phone or video call with a doctor - xx% task success, xx% directness**
  - This ta


## Recommendations

- Add VA Health Chat and VA Health Connect links as modalities to the Make an Appointment and Contact Us pages.
  - Potentially address content organization on these pages for ease of findability.
- Keep links to both VA Health Connect and VA Health Chat in the Manage your healthcare online section.
- Where available, add VA Health Connect where main contact info is present.
  - Additional consideration given to phone label for Veteran understanding of after hours care (24/7 availability)   


## Next Steps

1. Revise VAMC page designs to include VA Health Chat and VA Health Connect links according to above recommendations 
2. Analyze analytics related to links pointing to VA Health Connect campaign landing page, occuring in parallel to this study and monitor for additional improvements
3. Review possible placement differences in system vs. facility level. This study did not address this distinction.
