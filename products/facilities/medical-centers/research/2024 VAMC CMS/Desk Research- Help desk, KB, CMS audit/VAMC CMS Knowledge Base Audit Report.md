# VAMC CMS Knowledge Base Audit Report

**Explored by David Pearl • June 5th, 2024**

## Overview

This audit reviews the current state of the VAMC CMS Knowledge Base, identifying key issues and providing recommendations for improvement. The focus areas include audience and content relevance, structure and navigation, simplification and clarity, terminology and language, permissions and troubleshooting, update and maintenance, and additional features and enhancements.

---

## Audience and Content Relevance

### Findings:

1. **Unclear Audience:**
    - The knowledge base has content that is directed towards veterans rather than editors, distracting from editing tasks, such as the Veteran-centered
2. **Unnecessary Information:**
    - Contains highly-complex information about non-editable content, which is less relevant for editors.
3. **Irrelevant Top Tasks:**
    - Top tasks listed are relevant to veterans, not editors.

### Recommendations:

- **Remove Irrelevant Content:** Eliminate content that does not directly assist editors in performing their tasks.
- **Focus on Editable Content:** Concentrate on what can be edited and briefly list non-editable content in the introduction.
- **Refocus Task Listings:** Organize guides by how the page is constructed (e.g., all detail pages together) and remove references to top tasks that are not editor-specific.

---

## Structure and Navigation

### Findings:

1. **Redundant Articles:**
    - Multiple articles link to the same page and contain overlapping information (e.g., duplicate articles on how to add, edit, or remove a VAMC facility health service).
2. **Inconsistent Link Text:**
    - Link text on the KB homepage does not always match the actual page content, causing confusion.
3. **Poor Organization by Task Type:**
    - Articles are not well-organized by task type.

### Recommendations:

- **Consolidate Articles:** Merge redundant articles into single, comprehensive guides ensuring each article serves a unique purpose.
- **Accurate Link Text:** Ensure link text accurately reflects the content of the linked pages for better navigation.
- **Organize by Task Type:** Arrange articles by task type (e.g., Adding, Editing, Removing) to streamline navigation.

---

## Simplification and Clarity

### Findings:

1. **Overly Complex Processes:**
    - Some processes are overly complex with too many steps, making them intimidating.
2. **Missing Basic Instructions:**
    - Basic instructions for tasks like reordering, editing page intros, or removing content are missing.
3. **Similar Article Titles:**
    - Articles have similar names starting with "How to..." or "How do I...".
4. **Mix of Overviews and Actionable Steps:**
    - There is a mix of overview pages and actionable steps, which can be confusing.

### Recommendations:

- **Simplify Processes:** Break down complex processes into smaller, manageable parts using bulleted steps and sub-headers to better organize guides.
- **Include Basic Instructions:** Provide comprehensive instructions for all basic tasks editors need to perform.
- **Rename Articles:** Rename articles based on the location needing adjustment and include sections for specific actions (e.g., Health services > Adding a new health service).
- **Separate Overviews and Actions:** Distinguish between overview pages and actionable step-by-step guides to improve clarity.

---

## Terminology and Language

### Findings:

- **Inconsistent Titles and Terms:**
    - Titles and terms are not always clear or consistent (e.g., "situation update" vs. "banner").

### Recommendations:

- **Standardize Terminology:** Use clear, consistent terms in titles and standardize terminology across all articles.

---

## Permissions and Troubleshooting

### Findings:

1. **Missing Permission Details:**
    - Articles do not specify the permissions required to complete tasks.
2. **Lack of Troubleshooting Steps:**
    - Troubleshooting steps are missing from many articles.

### Recommendations:

- **Specify Permissions:** Include the necessary permissions at the beginning of each article.
- **Add Troubleshooting Sections:** Incorporate troubleshooting sections to help users resolve common issues.

---

## Update and Maintenance

### Findings:

- **Outdated Information:**
    - Some information in the knowledge base is outdated.

### Recommendations:

- **Regular Updates:** Establish a routine for regularly updating the knowledge base to keep information current.

---

## Additional Features and Enhancements

### Findings:

1. **Lack of Visual Aids:**
    - Many articles lack visual aids, making instructions harder to follow.
2. **Limited User Training Resources:**
    - There are limited resources for user training.
3. **Manual Help Desk Process:**
    - The help desk process is not automated, leading to inefficiencies.
4. **Non-Intuitive Section Name:**
    - The "Common links" section name is not intuitive.

### Recommendations:

- **Incorporate Visual Aids:** Add screenshots, diagrams, or videos to complement written instructions.
- **Expand Training Resources:** Offer additional resources for user training, such as webinars or interactive tutorials.
- **Automate Help Desk Process:** Consider automating the help desk process by auto-suggesting KB articles based on options chosen by users.
- **Rename "Common Links":** Change "Common links" to "Spotlight Section" for better visibility.

## Conclusion

Implementing these recommendations will enhance the usability and effectiveness of the VAMC CMS Knowledge Base. By focusing on the needs of the editors, streamlining processes, and maintaining up-to-date content, the knowledge base will become a more valuable resource for its users.
