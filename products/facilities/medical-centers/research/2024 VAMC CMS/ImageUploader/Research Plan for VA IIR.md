# Research Plan for VA IIR, CMS Image Uploader, August 16th, 2024

**Background**

Identify and understand the challenges VA.gov CMS editors face when uploading and managing images, such as event photos or profile photos, to VA.gov pages. By gaining insights into their workflow, pain points, and desired improvements, we aim to optimize the image upload and management process, reduce help desk requests, and empower editors to feel more confident in their asset creation.

**OCTO Priorities**

Objective 3: Our people are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact.

**Veteran Journey**

It is part of “Taking Care of Myself”, as users will start finding their VA facilities, who is in charge of facilities, events, and other areas of the [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) site impacted by image uploader.

**Research Goals**

1. Identify opportunities to improve the CMS image uploader so it is easy and effective for editors. 

**Outcome**

Based on on our findings, usability adjustments will be made to the image uploader in the CMS. 

**Research questions**

1. What is the current image upload and management process?
2. What are the challenges and pain points of the current image upload and management process?
3. What are the user needs and expectations for image upload and management?

**Hypothesis**

There are already known usability issues with the CMS image uploader marked by existing tickets, research from the help desk, and internal audits. Our hypothesis is that users will prefer the updated mockup, based on previous research, and will also provide additional feedback on ways to improve it. Since the goal is to make usability adjustments to the image uploader, the only way to validate and expand on these adjustments is through testing. 

**Methodology**

- Contextual inquiry - Used to review current process of image uploading
- Semi-structured interviews - Used to review updated mockups

**Location**

Zoom, moderated
