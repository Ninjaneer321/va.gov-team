# Research Plan for VA IIR, CMS Image Uploader, August 19th, 2024

**Background**

Based on prior research observations and UX audits, we have identified several pain points VA.gov CMS editors face when uploading and managing images.  This project aims to directly address these known issues, such as cropping/uploading photos to [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) pages. By addressing these targeted issues, we aim to:

- Optimize the image upload and management process.
- Reduce help desk requests related to image management.
- Empower editors to feel more confident and efficient in working with images.

**OCTO Priorities**

OKR 2.2: Our platforms measure and improve the satisfaction of their internal users.

**Veteran Journey**

As Veterans begin to engage with VA, learning about benefits through events and their local facilities, they will rely on accurate and quality content on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) pages that are created by Drupal CMS editors. The moments that matter include Getting out, Starting up, and Taking care of myself.

**Research Goals**

The purpose of this research is to **get editor feedback on the new CMS media upload design**.

**Outcome**

Based on on our findings, usability adjustments will be made to the image uploader in the CMS.

**Research questions**

- **Current media upload tool**
    - What are the challenges and pain points of the current image upload and management process?
- **Prototype of new media upload tool**
    - Do editors understand how to use the new media upload tool? (points of confusion of the user flow)
    - Do editors understand how and what to enter as alt text?

**Hypothesis**

There are already known usability issues with the CMS image uploader marked by existing tickets, research from the help desk, and internal audits. Our hypothesis is that users will prefer the updated mockup, based on previous research, and will also provide additional feedback on ways to improve it. Since the goal is to make usability adjustments to the image uploader, the only way to validate and expand on these adjustments is through testing.

**Methodology**

- Usability testing -  For usability testing of the new prototype
- Contextual inquiry - For reviewing current process of image uploading

**Location**

Zoom, moderated, via desktop or laptop, no mobile devices.
