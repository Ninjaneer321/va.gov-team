## Subject: Help Improve VA.gov Image Uploading (50-minute VA Sitewide Study)

Hi [CMS Editor's Name],

We're conducting a usability study as part of a VA.gov Sitewide initiative to improve the image uploading experience for CMS editors. Your valuable feedback is crucial in helping us create a more efficient and user-friendly platform.

We're inviting CMS editors to participate in a 50-minute remote study focused on the image uploading process.  During the study, you'll:

- Share your current experience uploading images to the CMS (brief interview)
- Test an updated version of the image uploader and provide feedback

**Your participation directly contributes to enhancing VA.gov for Veterans.**

If you're interested in sharing your insights and helping improve VA.gov, please sign up for a time slot on our calendly: https://calendly.com/david-pearl-adhocteam/cms-image-uploader

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best regards,

David Pearl
