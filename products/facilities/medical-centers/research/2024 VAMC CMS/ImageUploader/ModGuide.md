The purpose of this session is to understand your experience with uploading and managing images on the VA.gov CMS. Your feedback will help us improve the system for editors like you

### Warm-up and Background (7 minutes)

- Could you tell me a little about your role at the VA and how often you use the CMS to upload images?
- What types of images do you typically upload? (e.g., event photos, profile pictures, facilities images)
- Can you describe your general workflow when uploading an image?
    - Do you select the images or do you receive them?
    - Do you find yourself editing/cropping the image before you upload it?
- Do you typically use images already stored in the media library, or do you upload new images frequently?

### Current System Observation (10-15 minutes)

- Can you please open your CMS and log in, ready to add a new event?
- Imagine you're creating a new page for an upcoming event and need to add an event photo. Please think aloud as you complete the task. Tell me what you're doing and thinking as you go along.
    - *Consider having the moderator use a previous image they were sent, if not share the sample image.*
- *Observe participant's actions and provide prompts as needed:*
    - Can you walk me through what you're doing now?
    - What are you thinking about at this moment?
    - Is there anything about this step that seems difficult or confusing?
    - How would you improve this part of the process?
    - What is the difference between “Save and insert” and “Save and select”
- *If the participant mentions using the media library frequently, add this scenario:*
    - Now, let's say you have the event photo already saved in the VA.gov media library. How would you go about finding and inserting that image into your page?
    - *Observe participant's actions and provide prompts as needed:*
        - How easy was it to locate the image you needed in the media library?
        - Were there any difficulties in using an image from the library compared to uploading a new one?

### Prototype Feedback (10-15 minutes)

- Great, now I'd like to show you a potential redesign of the image upload system. Can you open up the Figma link which I shared earlier? Great!
- Without clicking, let’s take a minute to explore the new design. As you do, please share your initial thoughts and impressions.
- Observe participant's actions and provide prompts as needed:
    - What stands out to you about the new design?
    - How does it compare to the current system?
    - Are there any features you find particularly helpful or confusing?
- Now, let's try uploading the same image using the prototype. Please think aloud as you complete the task.
- Observe participant's actions and provide prompts as needed:
    - Did the new features help you upload the image more efficiently?
    - Was it easier to find what you needed compared to the current system?
    - Are there any features you found confusing or unnecessary?
    - Are there any improvements you'd like to see in the prototype?
    - If you had a magic wand, and could wave it and make this the perfect image uploader, what might you change?
- If the media library was used in the current system scenario, add this scenario:
    - Now, let's try using the prototype again. Imagine the event photo is already saved in the media library. Can you find and insert the image from the library using the new system?
    - Observe participant's actions and provide prompts as needed:
        - How easy was it to find the event photo in the media library using the prototype?
        - Did the prototype make it easier or more efficient to use images from the media library compared to the current system?
