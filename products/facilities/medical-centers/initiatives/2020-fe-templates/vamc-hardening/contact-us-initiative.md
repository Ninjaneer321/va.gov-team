# Initiative Brief Template
#### Overview

The Contact Us page & information on VAMC pages is a pain-point for Veterans and their caregivers/family. Editors also encounter issues in the lack of reusable content and organization of the form(s) where they enter Contact Us information.

This initiative will address both the Veteran et al, and the editor experiences.

## Problem
- It is difficult for Veterans to find and trust the contact information they seek on VAMC Contact pages. 
   - 5/16/23 Briefing on Foresee data indicated Veterans want accurate and complete information, particularly related to facility and/or individual contact information and phone numbers
   - Medallia feedback consistently includes frustration related to phone numbers - can't find them, no one answers them, long hold times, etc. 
   - [Contact us pages for VAMC have some of the lowest experience ratings across all of VA.gov
   - Veterans repeatedly report they want department extension numbers and cannot find them
- Creating the contact us page is not intuitive for editors. See #12087
- Audit for placeholder content (12/22/23) found 67 systems with "Coming soon" still present on the Contact us pages
   - This info was sent to VHA DM for remediation
- Veterans look for mailing addresses
