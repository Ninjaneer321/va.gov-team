## Health Services - Vaccination Services Taxonomy #17522
The Facilities needs a better understanding of how Veterans expect to find health services at VA as a foundational part of improving the Veteran search experience. 

## What we need to do

- Learn how we can support Veterans who search for vaccination services at VA health care systems.

## Goals

- Learn the Veteran mental models for vaccination within the health service taxonomy, primarily for VAMCs

### Questions to be answered by research results 
- Where in the VHA service taxonomy do Veterans expect vaccination services to be found?
  - For example, do they expect to find it under primary care, with pharmacy (related to "medication"), under a particular specialty; or within a taxon named "Vaccination" (or similar)?
  
### Follow up questions

  - What words do Veterans use when searching for vaccination-related services?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching - such as vaccine/vaccination vs immunization vs shot?
  - Flu or influenza
  - Coronavirus vs COVID
- Does the expectation change based on the type of vaccination?
  - Age-based (such as shingles or pneumococcal)
  - Risk-based (such as pneumococcal)
  - Seasonal flu
  - Time or incident-based (such as Tdap, Tdap Boosters)
  - COVID vaccination
  - COVID testing
- Have they had any vaccines in the last 10 years?
- When they get a vaccine, is it part of primary care (eg. VA visit)? Pharmacy visit? Town hall or other community-based vaccination program?
- How many times in the last 5 years have they had the flu shot?
- Do they plan to or did they take the shingles vaccine?
- Have they taken Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine / Have they taken Tdap booster?

## Method

- Moderated hybrid card sort. This method allows participants to select the location within the taxonomy where they expect to find vaccination services information. Participants may also create their own section within the taxonomy if they feel it is appropriate.
  - Using a card sort, 6 tasks will be given to account for real-world scenarios. Where would they expect to see information on: 
  1. Annual flu shot
  2. Tdap/Tdap booster - scheduled
  3. Tdap/Tdap booster - accident related
  4. COVID-19 vaccine
  5. Shingles vaccine
  6. Travel-related vaccines
  
- Moderation will provide opportunity for qualitative discovery through follow-up questions.


### Participant Criteria:

**Primary Criteria**

- Be a Veteran, active duty service member, reservist, or national guard member.
- Enrolled in VA health care

**Secondary Criteria**

At least:
- 3 participants living in a rural or remote area
- 3 participants living in a major metropolitan area
- 2 participants that do not have a college degree
- 4 females
- 2 participants of color
- 2 participants 35 or under
- 2 participants 36 - 50
- 2 participants 51 - 65
- 2 participants 66 - over
- 2 participants with cognitive disabilities
- 2 participants with a disability rating of 70% or greater

## Recruitment Process
- We'd like to schedule 15 participants to reach our goal of 10 fulfilled sessions.
- Researcher will work with Perigean to draft recruitment email and send out an interest email to Veterans
- Perigean sends another recruitment email (if needed)
