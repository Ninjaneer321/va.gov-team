# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand how Veterans and their families interpret new and existing service taxons for Vet Centers"
  - goal_2: "Validate proposed service taxonomy names match Veterans' mental models"
  - goal_3: "Identify vocabulary Veterans use when naming and categorizing services"

research_questions:
  - "Do the proposed taxon (service names) make sense to Veterans and their families?"
  - "Do participants' interpretations of the taxons match their intended meaning?"
  - "How would participants define and/or describe the taxons in their own words?"
  - "What vocabulary do participants use when naming and categorizing the service taxons?"
  - "How would Veterans group and categorize the taxons?"
  - "How should taxons and their descriptions evolve for Veterans to immediately understand them?"
  - "Will participants, who have not participated in mental health care, use the term 'Mental health care' when grouping counseling services?"

hypotheses:
  - "Participants will interpret 'Education and training' to mean services like workshops and classes in a non-therapeutic setting"
  - "Participants will interpret 'Transition counseling' to mean a broad range of services that help Veterans transition to civilian life"
  - "Participants will interpret 'Whole health' to mean a personalized health plan that focuses on an individual's values, needs and goals"
  - "Participants will interpret 'Veteran connections' to mean a service that includes helping Veterans navigate the VA and connect to resources"

expected_outcomes: "Findings will inform final service taxonomy labels and descriptions for Vet Center facility pages"

# Research Plan for Vet Centers, March 2021

## Goals	
The goal of this study is to understand how Veterans and their families understand and interpret new and existing service taxons that will be used by Vet Centers facilities, with a primary focus on the following:

- Education and training [new taxon]
- Transition counseling [new taxon]
- Veteran connections [new taxon]
- Whole health [existing taxon]

**Research questions**
- Do the proposed taxon (service names) make sense to Veterans and their families? 
- Do participants' interpretations of the taxons match their intended meaning?
- How would participants define and/or describe the taxons in their own words? 
- What vocabulary do participants use when naming and categorizing the service taxons?
- How would Veterans group and categorize the taxons?
- How should taxons and their descriptions evolve for Veterans to immediately understand them?
- Will participants, who have not participated in mental health care, use the term "Mental health care" when grouping counseling services?


**Hypothesis**
- Participants will interpret "Education and training" to mean services like workshops and classes in a non-therapeutic setting. 
- Participants will interpret "Transition counseling to mean a broad range of services that help Veterans transition to civilian life, like helping them connect with mental health services and education and career counseling.
- Participants will interpret "Whole health" to mean a personalized health plan that focuses on an individual's values, needs and goals rather than their illnesses or conditions. 
- Participants will interpret "Veteran connections" to mean a service that includes helping Veterans navigate the VA, by helping them to connect to VA and community resources. 


## Method	
Unmoderated card sort. An OptimalSort link will be sent to participants to participate in an unmoderated card sorting activity.	This study will be broken up into 6 mini studies, segmented by distinct deomographic cohorts. This method will help us answer our research questions by providing Veterans and their families the opportunity to complete the study in their own time without introducing moderator bias.

## Recruitment strategy

- We will utilize the Perigean contract for recruiting.
- We'd like to recruit 80 participants to reach our goal of receiving **40-60 participants** that meet the following criteria:

### Primary participant criteria:

This study will be broken up into 6 mini studies, segmented by the following 6 cohorts:

**Priority cohorts:**
- A - 6-10: Veterans 65+ [Vietnam era Veterans median age is 68 years]
- B - 6-10: Spouses/partners of Veterans (who have used VA.gov to look up health or benefit information regarding their Veteran spouse/partner's health)
- C - 6-10: New soldier/active duty service member (3 or less years since joining the military)
- D - 6-10: ~~3 or less years since discharge/separation from military service~~ Due to difficulty with recruiting this cohort, criteria was changed to Veterans 35-64 with a heavy emphasis on diversity, to have broader demographic representation
- E - 6-10: Veterans with a high school diploma, GED or less education

**Nice to have:**
- F - 6-10: Reservists

### Secondary criteria / Would like to have - 
- 10 participant of color 
- 10 participants living in a rural or remote area 
- 10 females
- 5 participant 35 or under 
- 5 participant 36 - 45 
- 5 participant 46 - 55 
- 5 participant 56 or over 
- 5 participant with cognitive disabilities 
- 5 participant without a college degree (to include officer Vets) 
- 5 participant living in a major metropolitan area 
- 5 participant with a disability rating of 70% or greater  


## Timeline
The link for the card sort will be shared out during the week of March:___ . The card sorting exercise should take participants 10-20 minutes to complete.

The card sort link will be tested by a member of the Facility Locator team prior to sending it out.	

## Team Roles	
Since this is an unmoderated study, there will be no team members present for the sessions.
