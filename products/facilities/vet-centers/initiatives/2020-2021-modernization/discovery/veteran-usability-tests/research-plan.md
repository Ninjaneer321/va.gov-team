# Research Plan: Vet Centers Detail Page - Usability Test  

**December 2020 Discovery**<br>

## Goal

The goal of this study is to get high level Veteran feedback on webpage designs to understand if they would have enough information to choose care at a Vet Center.

[Prototype to be tested](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636?mode=cvhidm)

### Research questions

Will Veterans:
 - understand what type of care is available at Vet Centers?
 - understand that they cannot get primary medical care at a Vet Center?
 - be able to find the service that they are looking for within the list of taxons?
 - know how to expand a service accordion to get details about individual services?
 - understand the relationship between Vet Center parent and child locations? 
 - understand that not all services are available at child locations? 
 - have enough information in order to visit or call a location? 


### Hypothesis 

- Veterans will understand the types of services offered/not offered.
- Veterans will have enough information to visit a location.
- Veterans will understand next steps for interacting with a Vet Center.
- Veterans will understand that child locations may not have the same services as a parent location.

## Method

- Sessions will combine directed interviewing (to understand participant's context and experience with VA counseling services) and usability testing, with task analysis, of a high-fidelity, desktop prototype created in UXPin. 
- Sessions will be remotely moderated via Zoom.

## Risks and assumptions

This study:
- will not test be tested on Mobile devices; there may be variance in how users process information and interact with content on large vs small screens
- will not test screen reader, keyboard or other Assistive Technology use; findings may not reveal problems that users with these technological constraints may encounter
- will use a prototype that will differ in how a fully programmed website will behave when a user zooms their browser and under low bandwidth conditions 

## Participants and Recruitment

- We will utilize the Perigean contract for **recruiting and notetaking**.
- We'd like to schedule 16 participants to reach our goal of observing **7-10 participants**. 

### Primary participant criteria:

#### MUST: 

- Be a Veteran, active duty service member, reservist, or national guard member.
