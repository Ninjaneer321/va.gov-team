### When the participant joins:

Objective: Validate which AT will be used and which device will be used.

- Thanks for joining us today! My name is Raquel. Today we're going to talk about first time interactions with VA.gov. Our discussion will help the team determine if there are any accessibility concerns we need to address.


#### **Intro - 5 minutes**

As we begin there are a few things I would like to start off with:

- The purpose of this session is to gain understanding of how we can improve the product for those using assistive technology. Are you using assistive technology in this session? What assistive tech are you using? (If not using assistive tech end session)

* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We want to hear your opinions so we can improve the website and make it work better for everyone.

- This entire session will take no more than 90 min. I will keep an eye on the time and may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic so we don’t go over.

* The format of this session is that we will talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where you review a prototype that is not released publicly. We will ask that you share your screen as you interact with the prototype and if there’s anything that doesn’t work the way you expect.

- Finally, is it ok if I record the screen and the audio during our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to to make sure our notes are accurate. The recordings will be destroyed after we do this.

#### **Section 1: Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Moderator: Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions so that we can get to know you and the type of tech you use.

1. What type of device will you use for this test?
2. What browser will you be using? (chrome, safari, edge, etc)

#### **Section 2: Set up screen share - 5 minutes**

##### **Review**

- During our session today, I am going to have you imagine that you have just created a VA.gov account and you are logging in for the first time. During this study I will share a link and login information for two different test users.I will share a link and provide a test user for you to use for this study.

* Before I send you the link, I would like to ask you to share your screen. I can walk you through how to start the screen share 

\[Help participant screen share]

- Great, I’m seeing your screen.

- Now I will share a link to the site. We have a few options to share the link. 

  - Would you like me to send it in the Zoom chat, 

  - to email it to you, 

  - or to read the link to you to type into your browser?\
    \[share link, make sure to use a shortlink with a “plain language” slug ([bit.ly/TheTest](http://bit.ly/TheTest), for example)]
