The information I received said I should upload all previous documents into my va.gov account.  So I’m trying to do that but before I can do that they want to know my phone number or email etc. which apparently are not on file. So every time I try and hit the edit button to add the number it rejects it saying something went wrong. I have tried it on both my computer and phone and get the same rejection.  Since I really can’t get into the system, I can’t upload my documents for my Tuesday meeting.
