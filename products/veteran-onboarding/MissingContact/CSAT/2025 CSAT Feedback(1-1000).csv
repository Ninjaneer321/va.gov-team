All I need is a referral to community care but I have to ""see"" the doctor and the first date available is October the 6th, this is unacceptable.   I just saw where RFK Jr. has required no referrals for 80% of treatments that require them for private insurance. Why does the VA not do the same for those of us in a small market?"
