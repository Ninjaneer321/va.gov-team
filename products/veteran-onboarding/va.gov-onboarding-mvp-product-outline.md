# **VA.gov Onboarding Flow - MVP**

### **Overview** 
The Iterate, Innovate, and Run (IIR) team is leading an initiative to build out a net new onboarding experience for va.gov users. The IIR teams plans to create a flow that is shown to LOA 3 users to help them more confidently navigate the authenticated experience so they can apply for manage the benefits they care about.

### **Problem Statement(s)**
- Users aren't taught how to navigate the authenticated experience, they are expected to figure it out on their own.
- Users don’t know what to do when they get to va.gov and they want to do something valuable.
- Users may miss out on benefits simply because they don't know how find them.
- The lack of an onboarding experience does not meet government goals of having digital experiences that are “consistent with [the public’s] favorite consumer websites and mobile apps.”

How might we statement: How might we help va.gov users confidently navigate the authenticated experience so that they can apply for and manage the benefits they care about.

### **Desired User Outcomes**
- Users are educated on where they can find and manage their benefits. 
- Users feel comfortable navigating to My Va, Profile hub, and My Healthevet.
- Users are trying to see what beneifts they can get.

### **Undesired User Outcomes**
- Users don't want to learn where they can find and manage their benefits.
- Users don't feel comfortable navigating to My VA, Profile hub, or My Healthevet.
- Users are still unsure and confused on how to navigate the authenticated experience.

### **Launch Strategy**

We plan for every user to see this flow - whether they are brand new to VA.gov or not. We will do a slow rollout behind a feature flag so we can closely monitor traffic, usage, and potential bugs. No notifications or comms are needed.

### **Launch Dates**

1. TBD but estimating Fall - October/November
