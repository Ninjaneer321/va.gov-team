- **Next Steps**:
  - Modify the vets-website component to fetch data from the updated API endpoints.
  - Implement the ability to accept or deny POA requests.

## Establish `representative.va.gov` Subdomain

**Objective**: Set up the `representative.va.gov` subdomain to host the Accredited Representative Portal.
**Relevant Epic**:
