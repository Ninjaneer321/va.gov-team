# P1 Notes

## P1 Context

P1 has many years of expertise, developed over time as she worked as a VSO at the County level, worked as a VA employee at the Regional Office, and then now is a representative with Wounded Warrior Project (WWP).

- She has been with WWP for three years
- She is a Veteran herself.
- Being at WWP is less restrictive than working at the VA, and she felt like she is able to better serve the Veteran in her current role.

She currently uses **SEP, the Accredited Representative Portal, and QuickSubmit**. She continues to use QuickSubmit even though she “despises” it, because some Veterans want to use paper. She uses both SEP and ARP because she currently sees sometimes, requests come into SEP that are not in ARP or vice versa, or sometimes they appear in both.

She **most prefers speaking over the phone with the Veteran as they log into VA.gov and complete their own submission** while over the phone, because that will **establish the End Product (EP) the fastest in VBMS.** Her second preference is to use SEP because for the forms she can submit through SEP, they also get established faster. QuickSubmit can take many days, a week or more to get established.

When she submits a form through QuickSubmit, she tracks it to make sure the EP is established. After EP is established, she follows the claim closely and pays attention to activity related to these topics.

- Exams
- Ratings
- Response letter to the Veteran
- Award letter

She communicates activity to the Veteran, and also encourages them to download the app.

At WWP, they refer to Veterans as "Warriors" and dependents as "Family support members." While what we have in the portal is different from this, she felt that "claimant" and "representation requests" were appropriate.

## Portal features

### Signing in

- The first time she signed in, her email was not the one associated with OGC. After resolving this issue, she was able to link her PIV easily. She was anxious about her Veteran account and ARP account being confused, but was relieved to learn that they operated separately.
- She signs in to ARP multiple times a day to check for new requests.

### Representation Request

WWP has been a pilot participant for nearly two months, and during that time she tested the Representation Request feature. (The 21-686c and 21-626 just launched about 1-2 weeks prior).

She **will not accept a request blindly,** and **will revisit their Salesforce CRM to see notes** on the Veteran. She'll revisit a request 1-3 times before accepting. If the request comes from a Veteran she has spoken to directly, she will only need to review the request once. Seeing the "preferred representative name" in the request helps her identify which representative to search for in the CRM and coordinate with; it incrementally improves speed of this workflow.

"\[Representation requests\] is my favorite portion of \[ARP\] because SEP it was 24 hours, maybe 72 hours before we had actually full access to the document side.... the longest I've had to wait \[in ARP\] was 15 minutes."

To improve this feature, she had the following suggestions:

- She would like to write in an **open-ended reason for declining the request**.
- She also shared **a request that could not processed since 8/5/2025**, that was still sitting in her view. She wondered if it would continue to be there. The team created a ticket to investigate this issue.
- She would like a **search by alphabetical, last name option**. Searching through representation requests, even when it becomes paginated, is faster than entering in information into Find Claimant

### Find Claimant

She has not used this feature yet; **requiring all four fields felt excessive** – similar to what we’ve heard from other studies.

“For me, it's too much for me like it, it disrupts my workflow. I should say like I want to be a lot quicker. And so for me it's a lot quicker just to scroll.”

### Submissions

She has not used this feature yet; **she could tell that it would not auto-establish the EP**. She would prefer using her current method of walking the Veteran through the form over the phone.

If ARP were to show statuses, she would expect only high-level information including the following:

- If the EP was established
- If the claim was under review
- If the claim was rated

What the Veteran sees is not detailed enough for her, and it can be confusing when the numbers revert back to development. In VBMS, she tracks the claim fairly closely and looks for why and the accuracy of what is happening.

She also does not want ARP to anticipate what she's looking for in VBMS and show all the information there because it would be overwhelming. VBMS is where she does the investigation and she doesn't expect to do that in ARP.

“\[If it shared what she is looking for in VBMS\] I just feel as though it would be too much information on this side \[in the portal\] that wouldn't necessarily be utilized. And so I would be afraid that it then would be just overwhelming, overstimulating versus being simple and clear and concise.”

## Satisfaction and future features

She was **very satisfied with getting quick access to VBMS and the visual ease of ARP**. However, she expressed anxiety over **losing the ability to immediately establish EPs** with other forms in SEP and **losing the ability to see payments details.**
