# WWP and MVAD Pilot Research Outline

June 2025

We are piloting the Accredited Representative Portal with accredited representatives at Montana Veteran Affairs Division (MVAD) (<https://dma.mt.gov/mvad/>) and Wounded Warriors Project ([https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/).](https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/%29.) During pilot, pilot participants will use representative requests and 686c submission functionality within ARP. We will use a few methods to learn from the pilot. Kick-off is planned for end of June.

## Process deep dive calls

We will hold a process deep dive call with each organization to understand how the organization operates. We will touch on these topics.

- Office locations and size
- Veteran population
- Volume
- Supervisory structure
- Intake process

Technology setup and application usage

- Communication with Veterans
- Communication with OGC/certifying official
- Help support channels

## Weekly Feedback

During pilot, we will send out a weekly feedback prompt 1x a week to all pilot participants. The prompt will take the form of a short question that should take no more than 5-10 minutes to respond to. In some cases, we will ask pilot participants at the beginning of the week to complete a task and then check-in later in the week with a question that relates to that task. We learned from last pilot that it is important to loop in supervisors to help with nudging participants to respond.

Example questions:

- Were you able to sign in to the portal this week? What issues, if any, did you have during the sign in process?
- Are Veterans interested in submitting VA Form 21-22 online? If not, what reasons are they giving for not wanting to use this method?
- If you could change one thing about your current process of establishing POA with a Veteran, what would it be?
- Did you receive any POA requests in the portal this week?  
    If so, please tell us your stories! What were the circumstances and how did the process unfold for you and the Veterans.
- Did you sign in to the portal this week? Why or why not?
- Did you submit any forms using the portal this week? Why or why not?
- Are representatives needing to support Veterans in completing the 21-22 flow on VA.gov? Or are Veterans able to do this on their own?
- [Weekly Feedback ideas from Connecticut pilot](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/vaabdvro/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE248F162-97B3-489A-B73E-D6DB81370862%7D&file=2025%2003%20ARP%20Pilot%20-%20Weekly%20Feedback%20posts.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

## 1:1 Conversations

Through the pilot, we will conduct a few 1:1 conversations with individual pilot participants to learn about their experiences using ARP and surface ideas for improvement. We will work to identify opportunities for shadowing representatives doing real work within the portal.
