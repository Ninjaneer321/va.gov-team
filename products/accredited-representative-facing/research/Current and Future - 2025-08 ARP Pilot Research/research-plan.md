# Research Design
methodology: "Multi-method pilot research - process deep dive calls, weekly feedback prompts, 1:1 conversations, and shadowing"
research_format: 
  location: remote
  in_person_details:
    facility: "N/A"
    point_of_contact: "N/A"
    equipment: "N/A"
  moderated: true
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand how pilot organizations operate and their technology setup through process deep dives"
  - goal_2: "Gather continuous feedback on pilot participants' experiences using ARP features through weekly prompts"
  - goal_3: "Learn about representatives' real-world experiences and surface improvement ideas through 1:1 conversations and shadowing"

research_questions:
  - "How do the organizations structure their offices, handle volume, and manage intake processes?"
  - "What supervisory structure and technology setup exists at each organization?"
  - "How do representatives communicate with Veterans and with OGC/certifying officials?"
  - "What help support channels are needed for pilot participants?"
  - "Were you able to sign in to the portal this week? What issues did you encounter?"
  - "Are Veterans interested in submitting VA Form 21-22 online? What reasons do they give?"
  - "Did you receive or submit any forms using the portal? Why or why not?"
  - "Are representatives needing to support Veterans in completing the 21-22 flow on VA.gov, or can Veterans do this on their own?"
  - "What would you change about your current process of establishing POA with a Veteran?"

hypotheses:
  - "Pilot participants will encounter both expected and unexpected challenges when using ARP in real-world scenarios"
  - "Weekly feedback prompts will surface issues and insights that wouldn't emerge in one-time interviews"
  - "Process deep dives will reveal organizational differences that affect how ARP should be designed"
  - "Shadowing representatives doing real work will uncover usability issues and workflow gaps"

expected_outcomes: "Learn from pilot to improve ARP before broader release. Weekly feedback (5-10 min responses) will surface ongoing issues. 1:1 conversations and shadowing will provide deep insights into representative experiences and improvement opportunities. Process deep dives will inform how to support different organizational structures."

# WWP and MVAD Pilot Research Outline

June 2025

We are piloting the Accredited Representative Portal with accredited representatives at Montana Veteran Affairs Division (MVAD) (<https://dma.mt.gov/mvad/>) and Wounded Warriors Project ([https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/).](https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/%29.) During pilot, pilot participants will use representative requests and 686c submission functionality within ARP. We will use a few methods to learn from the pilot. Kick-off is planned for end of June.

## Process deep dive calls

We will hold a process deep dive call with each organization to understand how the organization operates. We will touch on these topics.

- Office locations and size
- Veteran population
- Volume
- Supervisory structure
- Intake process

Technology setup and application usage

- Communication with Veterans
- Communication with OGC/certifying official
- Help support channels

## Weekly Feedback

During pilot, we will send out a weekly feedback prompt 1x a week to all pilot participants. The prompt will take the form of a short question that should take no more than 5-10 minutes to respond to. In some cases, we will ask pilot participants at the beginning of the week to complete a task and then check-in later in the week with a question that relates to that task. We learned from last pilot that it is important to loop in supervisors to help with nudging participants to respond.

Example questions:

- Were you able to sign in to the portal this week? What issues, if any, did you have during the sign in process?
- Are Veterans interested in submitting VA Form 21-22 online? If not, what reasons are they giving for not wanting to use this method?
- If you could change one thing about your current process of establishing POA with a Veteran, what would it be?
- Did you receive any POA requests in the portal this week?  
    If so, please tell us your stories! What were the circumstances and how did the process unfold for you and the Veterans.
- Did you sign in to the portal this week? Why or why not?
- Did you submit any forms using the portal this week? Why or why not?
- Are representatives needing to support Veterans in completing the 21-22 flow on VA.gov? Or are Veterans able to do this on their own?
- [Weekly Feedback ideas from Connecticut pilot](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/vaabdvro/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BE248F162-97B3-489A-B73E-D6DB81370862%7D&file=2025%2003%20ARP%20Pilot%20-%20Weekly%20Feedback%20posts.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

## 1:1 Conversations

Through the pilot, we will conduct a few 1:1 conversations with individual pilot participants to learn about their experiences using ARP and surface ideas for improvement. We will work to identify opportunities for shadowing representatives doing real work within the portal.
