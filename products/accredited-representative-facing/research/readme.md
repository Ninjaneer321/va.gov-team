Additional research content: 
- **VBMS walkthrough:** In August 2024, a VSO representative from Wounded Warrior Project walked us through how he uses VBMS. This was not part of a formal research effort and therefore not included in the table above, but it led to helpful insights. See the [VBMS walkthrough recording](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:v:/s/vaabdvro/Ecu9_EgRZwpPgt7jd0l4j6kB8eClpSSvdQNGE3zyMaEeHA?e=quhspB) and [notes from the VBMS walkthrough](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/research/VBMS-walkthrough-notes.md).
