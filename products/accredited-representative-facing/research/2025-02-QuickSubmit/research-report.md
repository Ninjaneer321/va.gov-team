# Background

The Accredited Representative Facing (ARF) Team is building an Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) that will allow Veteran Service Organization (VSO) representatives to submit online any claim and supporting evidence to the VA. While ARP will be a new tool, accredited representatives are familiar with another submission tool, QuickSubmit, that allows them to submit files online via a PDF upload.

This research was intended as a quick study to learn about how some VSO representatives use QuickSubmit.

# Research Goals

- What QuickSubmit functionality are VSO reps utilizing today and why?
- Outside of the speed to submission, what QuickSubmit functionality could be improved?

# Executive Summary

Representatives highly valued and appreciated QuickSubmit’s rate of upload success and ease of use, even using this tool over others they could access. Based on their feedback, we recommend implementing the following functionality for ARP.

- Upload multiple files at one time
- Indicate priority of submission to expedite processing
- Receive confirmation of submission by email
- Preview the document
- View claim upload status, and see whether or not it was processing, complete, or experienced an error

We also recommend continual and early testing of ARP, so that it also has a high upload success rate and is as easy to use as QuickSubmit.

# Key Findings

**Caveat:** we only spoke with three VSO representatives, who have 10-27 cases at a given time. Their organizations sounded less complex than others in the “Big 6,” and no one shared that they needed permissions to submit information on behalf of claimants.

## 1\. Representatives use QuickSubmit because it works for the single purpose it was built for

QuickSubmit has a singular purpose — to submit claim forms and evidence for claimants. No matter how many tools a VSO representative uses, they could rely on QuickSubmit for this one purpose. VSO reps encountered upload issues with SEP, MyVA, and Vetraspec, while they never encountered issues with uploads in QuickSubmit. One representative reviewed their past upload history of about 100 different submissions, and all of their statuses were “Complete,” meaning that information is available in the Central Mail (CM) portal.

- “SEP system 95% of the time, it doesn't upload the document. I try MyVA too, and it doesn't work.” – P1
- “I could submit them directly off Vetraspec… but it was like when I would submit them… they were out there floating for awhile, which is troublesome if you’re filing a 21-22 and trying to see what the Vet has previously claimed.” – P2, who now only uses QuickSubmit to upload files.

## 2\. Representatives felt very positive about QuickSubmit’s ease and success rate

These representatives did not criticize the length of time it took for QuickSubmit submissions to appear in VBMS. They had very few negative comments about QuickSubmit, instead applauding its ease of use, learnability, and upload success — especially because they had previously used fax. When P1 learned that this tool existed, he told all his colleagues and even set up an account for his manager.

- "Everything is, you know, very self-explanatory and the more you use it, the easier it becomes. " – P3
- “It’s really slick.” – P2

## 3\. After POA is established, and representatives enter information about the claimant into their CRMs, representatives use QuickSubmit

Representatives were ready to use QuickSubmit once POA was established, and after setting up the Veteran's file and claim in Vetraspec. After submitting the claim, they don’t need to revisit QuickSubmit unless they are submitting another claim. One representative searched the former uploads when Veterans asked to confirm whether or not he uploaded a piece of evidence, but the others did not need to use the search feature.

## 4\. Feature specific feedback

This report describes in further detail all the features that are of medium, high or very high importance. If a feature is marked as having low importance, no representatives used them.

The overall recommendation is to implement features that are marked as “Very High” or “High” importance.

| **Features** | **Importance to Representatives** |
| --- | --- |
| Upload multiple files at one time | Very High |
| Indicate priority of submission to expedite processing | High |
| Receive confirmation of submission by email | High |
| Preview the document | High |
| View Claim upload status | High |
| Use email of choice for notifications | Medium/High |
| View CM Packet Number | Medium |
| Search QuickSubmit upload history | Medium |
| Search Direct Upload Archives, the tool used prior to QuickSubmit | Low |
| Receive confirmation of submission by text | Low |
| Switch VSO orgs based on claim | N/A; only 1 rep we spoke with was cross-accredited |
| Manage roles and permissions | N/A; no one had an administrator role |

## 4.1. Feature: Upload multiple files at one time

Importance: Very High

Of the last 10 submissions P1 made, four submissions contained 1 file; three submissions contained 2 files; one submission contained 4 files and two submissions contained 8 files. Representatives submitted up to 15 files at a time, so representatives need this functionality.

- “The most \[files uploaded for a submission\] would be for surviving spouse benefits, and the reason for that is because they need all the additional documentation to prove their marriage is valid. There’s the 21-22, the 534, the death certificate, the 530 for burial grant, the 41-71, 41-70 for friends and family validating the marriage…” – P3

## 4.2. Feature: Indicate priority of submission to expedite processing

Importance: High

Representatives selected an “Emergent Indicator” when a claimant should have their claim expedited, such as if they were over 85, or if they were diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or were homeless. One stated that the processing time for ALS Veterans should be two weeks max, rather than 5 months. Two representatives recognized however, that selecting the “emergent indicator” does not always seem to change claims processing times based on their experience.

- "For those guys \[with ALS\], claims cannot be taking 3,4,5 months to process. They’ve got to be very, very quick. And so I’m very lucky in that I work in a VA regional office and I can contact \[RO Coaches\] and say, I just submitted a claim for this person.” – P3
- “A lot of times when they are in a nursing home, I definitely use the age indicator… although the pension people tell me that doesn’t pertain to them, I still do it.” – P2

## 4.3 Feature: Receive confirmation of submission by email

Importance: High

The confirmation number and email provides assurance and a record, even if it is only internal to QuickSubmit and not tracked in VBMS. One representative recorded the confirmation number in Vetraspec, another printed it out and added it to the claimant’s file, and another would sometimes forward the confirmation email to the Veteran. For these representatives, this was a “just in case” (P2) piece of information, that they did not refer to later.

## 4.4 Feature: Preview the document

Importance: High

Two representatives previewed files within a submission to make certain that the file they uploaded was the one intended. Sometimes a claimant would ask them to check, and other times, the preview adds assurance. One representative did not use the preview because she reviewed files before she scanned them and then also reviewed them on her computer prior to uploading.

## 4.5 Feature: View claim upload status

Importance: High

All the VSO representatives noticed the status changes in QuickSubmit, but they did not spend effort to closely track them. VSO representatives at most paid attention to “Pending”, “Vendor processing”, “Error” and “Complete” statuses. More statuses are offered in QuickSubmit, but the reps did not mention these. QuickSubmit’s high upload completion rate likely built enough trust, so that representatives did not feel a need to follow statuses (nor need to understand the definition of them) of submission uploads.



## 4.6 Feature: Search upload history

Importance: Medium

The one representative searched upload history when a claimant asked to confirm the files submitted. The other representatives never had a need to review submissions in QuickSubmit and used VBMS instead.

## 4.7 Feature: Use email of choice for notifications

Importance: Medium

Representatives did recognize the value of selecting a different email other than the one in their OGC profile to receive confirmation emails. With this option, they could route confirmations to whichever email best fit their workflows.

- “This is my PVA email \[not the one in OGC\]... this is where I prefer to receive all of my things because this is where I do the most amount of my Veterans’ work… not so much through VA applications… but I do understand that most organizations work strictly on the VA side and so that would be perfect for them to have their VA emails.” – P3.

## 4.8 Feature: View CM Packet number

Importance: Low

On a few occasions, one representative called the VA hotline to confirm that CM received files, and the VA hotline would ask for the CM packet number. This number appears to be a helpful way to search for the submission in CM – but not necessarily the only way. While one representative saw the value in having this number, the other two representatives did not know its purpose.

## 5\. Potential improvements

While representatives were largely satisfied with QuickSubmit, they mentioned a few improvements.

## 5.1. Benefit types need better definition and clarity

When uploading files, representatives select a benefit claim type, and not all these claim types are clear. No one knew what VOSB benefit type referred to, and one representative learned through trial and error that QuickSubmit did not forward Life Insurance claims to the right (if any) department, so that category should not be listed. One representative recommended that form numbers be added to the types for clarity.

- “What I'll do if \[I feel the claim is\] borderline, I'll submit to pension and I'll go back and resubmit the same thing under compensation to make sure it gets to the right place" – P1
- “So several years ago when Quicksubmit first came up... I would submit insurance claims and I would select this \[benefit type\] and then I would get a call back from the Veteran or for the surviving spouse saying, ‘Hey, we haven't heard anything back. It's been 3 months.’ And so I finally figured out through them that they're not getting anything.” – P3

Recommendation: We should understand the purpose of benefit claim types and if, when they are needed.



## 5.2. Expedited Submission should be apparent, when marking an emergent indicator

While all representatives expected that an emergent indicator would expedite the submission and work on the claim, two were suspicious of how consistent it was, with one knowing for certain that some claims marked as emergent were not expedited.

Recommendation: We should understand how and when claims are expedited and communicate that to representatives accordingly.

## 5.3. Error handling post submission

When they were asked the question, “Have you ever submitted a file, then realized there was an error on it? What did you do next?” two representatives said they experienced this issue and their current solutions felt unsatisfactory. One would resubmit the file, another realized she entered the SSN# incorrectly and did not know how to correct it.

- "Just redid the form and resubmitted it, and then I'd call the VA and say, hey, make a note with the VBA \[to use the most recently submitted form\]… there's no place in any of these things when dealing with the VA where you can put a note, you know, I mean, it's so stupid. .. It's just a flag to save them some time." – P1
- “I switched the last two digits of his SSN and realized it a day later…when I asked around nobody knew.. I don’t know who to get a hold of to let them know that I messed that up… but then it showed up correct in VBMS.” – P2

Recommendation: Offer means to resolve an error post file submission or prior to submission. Not all representatives were aware of the hotline P1 referred to.

# Recommendations

## 1\. Implement very high and high importance features

While we spoke with only three VSO reps, we do recommend implementing features that are very high and of high importance that include the following:

- Upload multiple files at one time
- Indicate priority of submission
- Receive confirmation of submission by email
- Preview the document
- View claim upload status

Uploading multiple files at one time is necessary for many forms, and former research calls out the importance of these other features, such as transparency of status and confirmation of submission (Refer to report [VSO rep Listening Sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/research/2024-01%20Listening%20Session/research-report.md), report [VSO VA Benefits Interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representation-management/research/2024-10-VSO-VAbenefits-interviews/research-findings.md#mvp-recommendations)).

Enabling means to reduce errors, either pre or post submission, could also be prioritized depending on a discussion of needs.

## 2\. Design to include the functionality available in the backend

As a follow up to potential improvements noted, we should understand how files and submissions are routed and prioritized through CM to see what functionality we can include to reflect what can take place.

## 3\. Test early with VSO representatives to ensure ease of use and satisfaction

We also recommend that we continually test iterations of ARP and get feedback as early as possible to confirm that this tool meets their needs. QuickSubmit is a tool where all the actions to submit files are on one page and the actions are not complex, which increases the perceived ease of use. ARP should also be perceived as simple, if not more, and have a high success rate of upload completion.

## 4\. Plan for change management

Given how much these representatives valued QuickSubmit as their primary tool for “getting in the doorway” (P3) of the VA, we also recommend a clear change management strategy to handle any transition. For many representatives – though we do not know how many for certain – QuickSubmit may be their only way of submitting files to the VA for claims.

## Open Questions

Because our sample was so small, we did have gaps in this study. We did not receive enough feedback from those who were cross-accredited and how often they switched organizations based on the claimant or claim type, nor did we hear from anyone who had an administrator role in QuickSubmit.

We also did not speak with any representative with larger caseloads, and do not know if they use QuickSubmit differently.

# Appendix

## Reference files

Prior to this research, we compared QuickSubmit and the Simple Forms Upload tool. The features we learned about from this activity were included in this study.

The Veterans facing forms team conducted a quick accessibility audit to identify issues with QuickSubmit. The concerns were enough to warrant moving forward with the Simple Forms Upload Tool.
