# Research Plan for ARF, QuickSubmit Review for ARP, Feb 2025

## Background

The Accredited Representative Facing (ARF) Team is building an Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) that will allow Veteran Service Organization (VSO) representatives to submit online any claim and supporting evidence to the VA. To use the tool, users will download a PDF of the selected form, fill it out, upload the form and then click submit.

VSO representatives need to be authorized on the portal and also have power of attorney for the Veteran or claimant prior to submitting information on the Veteran’s behalf. While ARP will be a new tool, accredited representatives are familiar with another VA tool, QuickSubmit, that allows them to submit claims and evidence online via a PDF upload approach.

### OCTO Priorities

**VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits**. We will build tools for accredited representatives to submit claims and supporting documentation more effectively and efficiently. ARP will redirect traffic from SEP and QuickSubmit to reduce the number of VA tools representatives use.

## Research Goals

- What QuickSubmit functionality are VSO reps utilizing today and why?
- Outside of the speed to submission, what QuickSubmit functionality could be improved?

## Outcome

This research will inform functionality of the PDF download/upload tool in ARP, so VSO reps find the tool valuable and easy-to-use.

## Methodology

Semi-structured interviews, during which we will request that with their permission, they share their screen to demonstrate use of the tool.

### Location

Remote sessions, over Teams

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

VSO representatives are our primary audience. We will be utilizing our VSO research panel to fulfill criteria. There will be no screener.

### Recruitment criteria

- Two-three VSO representatives that represent a large VSO and small or medium VSO.

Primary criteria (must-haves)

- All representatives must use QuickSubmit on behalf of claimants
- Mixture of state representation
- Mixture of county VSO vs Big 6
- Mixture of years of experience

## Timeline

\- \[x\] 2/5 Prep research plan and discussion guide, submit for asynchronous feedback.

\- \[x\] 2/7 Send recruitment emails. Include request for them to share screen and inform them of our security around PII.

\- \[x\] 2/11 Refinement of discussion guide.

\- \[x \] 2/13 - 2/14 Hold sessions.

\- \[x \] 2/14 Analysis and synthesis.

\- \[x \] 2/24 Write summary of findings.

Timeline is an estimation and will be updated if needed. Representative availability might impact this timeline.

### Research sessions

\* Planned dates of research: 2/13/2025 and 2/14/2025

### Length of sessions

\* Session length: 30 minutes

\* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes

\* Maximum Sessions per day: 3

## Team Roles

\- Moderators: Laura Paradis.

\- Research guide writing and task development: Laura Paradis

\- Participant recruiting & scheduling: Laura Paradis

\- Project point of contact: Laura Paradis

\- Notetakers: Kate Albee, Eva Heintzelman would rotate notetaking responsibilities

\- Observers: Kate Albee, Eva Heintzelman, Candi Lemoine, Patrick Brown, Gregory Hedrick, Jennifer Bertsch, Lesley Ropp

## Moderator logistics

### 2-3 days before the session

\- \[x \] Setup notetaking document/spreadsheet/mural.

\- \[x \] Review notetaking document/spreadsheet/mural with notetakers

\- \[x\] Create schedule of interviews, observers and notetakers.

\- \[x \] Appoint a backup moderator (Kate or Eva).

\- \[x \] Have ready the Teams call-in number to share if the participant needs it.

\- \[x\] Test Teams and screensharing on GFE; the facilitator screensharing will be a fallback if the participant’s screen sharing does not work. No PII will be entered in this scenario.

\- \[x\] Setup private slack channel inform roles of the notetaking board, the schedule of sessions, and who would like to attend. Include Laura Paradis contact information.

\- \[x \] Email reminder to participants the day before and include Laura Paradis contact information.

\- \[x \] 15 min prior to study start time, send a message in feedback-channel to inform that the study is taking place with a link to notes.

### Day of the session

\- Use \[feedback-backchannel\](<https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/>) in

Slack for real-time feedback from observers.

\- Mute your Slack notifications.

\- Send out the \[observer instructions\](<https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html>) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into \[feedback-backchannel\](<https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel>)).

### Starting the session

\- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.

\- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked

\- Check your \[screensharing setup\] and share permissions for participants.

\- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro\*

# Conversation Guide

## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for signing up to give feedback to the VA about their software products for accredited representatives.

My name is \[NAME\] and \[NOTETAKER NAME\] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues who are listening in to learn.

As part of these sessions, we invite observers who are team members listening to learn.

\- Briefly introduce team and then ask that they turn off their cameras.

Today we're going to talk about how you use QuickSubmit and its features.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- For part of the session today, we will have you share your screen so that we can see how you use QuickSubmit. We are all in a secure environment so it is ok to show PII.
- We would like to record our session if that’s OK with you; we use the recordings for team members who were not able to be with us today and also to go back if our notes are unclear. We will not share any part of the video outside of our team without your permission and we have practices in place to safeguard any PII and PHI we may record. The findings we report will not include your name or any attributions to you.
- Is it ok with you if we record this session?
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
- Ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

\*Start recording.\*

- OK, the recording has started. Just so we have it on record, is it OK for us to record our session?

## Warm-up & Background Questions - 3 minutes

  - Thank them for their support of Veterans
- How often do you use QuickSubmit?
- When do you tend to use QuickSubmit versus other tools? Why?
- Do you know, by chance, if you have admin access or employee level access to QuickSubmit? (Admin access means that you would be able to see all submissions for employees within an organization.)
  - If you have admin access, what do you do as an admin?
- At what point in the process of helping a Veteran or claimant do you start using QuickSubmit? When do you stop using it?

## QuickSubmit Submission Demo - 8 minutes

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on these products to make sure they meet your needs.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

- We’re primarily interested in folks who are using QuickSubmit. If you haven’t used it before, we can end this session early, and I’ll update our database on tools that you use.
- Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
- Plan for a backup moderator.
