# Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for taking part in the pilot program for this Accredited Representative portal.

My name is \[Laura/Kate\] and I’m a researcher working to improve this tool. \[NAME\] will be joining us to take notes. I also have a couple other colleagues who are listening in to learn.

- Briefly introduce team and then ask that they turn off their cameras.

Today we're going to ask you to about your experiences using the portal, what you like and don’t like about and how we could continue to make this better.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This entire session should take **about an hour**.
- In this session, **we want to hear your honest opinions**. There are **no right or wrong answers**; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We are testing how this tool has performed for you so I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary**. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- \[If we cannot share screen\] For part of the session today, **we will ask that sign in to the portal and speak to your specific experience.** You will not be sharing your screen during this time. Because we will not be seeing your screen, **we will ask that you communicate what you see in detail, especially when there are points of confusion and/or improvement**.
- \[If we determine that this is allowed, we can have them share screen\] For part of the session today, **we will ask that you share your screen so you can comment on specific features of the portal.** Any PII that is visible is staying on secure VA networks as we are all on our GFE and VPN, or CAG.
- **We would like to record our session** if that’s OK with you; we use the recordings for team members who were not able to be with us today and also to go back if our notes are unclear. We will not share any part of the video outside of our team without your permission and we have practices in place to safeguard any PII and PHI we may record. The findings we report will not include your name or any attributions to you.
- **Is it ok with you if we record this session?**
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
- Ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

\*Start recording.\*

- OK, the recording has started. **Just so we have it on record, is it OK for us to record our session?**
