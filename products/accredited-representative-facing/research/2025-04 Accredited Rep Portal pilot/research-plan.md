# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Evaluate usability of ARP, searching and accepting/declining a POA request"
  - goal_2: "Understand accredited representative workflows more fully, especially related to POA"
  - goal_3: "Understand high-level organizational procedures of a small NE state VSO (Connecticut Veterans Affairs)"

research_questions:
  - "Can representatives complete tasks quickly and efficiently through this design, or could it be improved?"
  - "Is the information/content clearly presented, or are there any points of confusion?"
  - "What technologies and processes do reps use? (Devices, screen size, tools/apps, when they work online vs offline?)"
  - "What activities happen before, during, and after accepting a POA request?"
  - "What information do reps want to search POA requests by?"
  - "Do reps want to submit intent to file (ITF) immediately after accepting a POA request?"
  - "What do reps want to be informed/notified about the POA request?"
  - "What differences, if any, are there between small and large org approach to accepting POA?"
  - "How do they determine who reviews what POA requests? By geographic area? By rep requested? What else?"
  - "Do larger orgs require different search or filter options?"
  - "What other functionality is required for reps to fully adopt ARP?"
  - "What technologies and processes are used in your organization?"
  - "What % of claimant meetings are in-person vs virtual?"
  - "Are any of your reps using assistive technology?"
  - "What is the role of a VSO manager/supervisor?"

hypotheses:
  - "Reps will easily find and accept a POA request"
  - "Reps will be excited they can see the Veteran information in VBMS within minutes of accepting POA"
  - "Reps will want more functionality, wonder what we plan on building next and how soon"
  - "Reps will want to update their contact information directly in the portal"
  - "All reps will want to search requests by first name, last name, and/or SSN"
  - "Cross-accredited reps and reps from larger orgs will want/need more granular search and filter options than smaller orgs. Needs will vary depending on an organization's work processes"

expected_outcomes: "This research will uncover any initial usability issues with ARP pilot that need to be addressed before releasing our product to a broader audience of accredited representatives. The additional insights we gather about organizational processes and representative workflows will help guide the future direction and designs for ARP."

# Research Plan: Accredited Representative Portal

[Accredited Representative-Facing (ARF) Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/README.md)

Updated March 31, 2025 by Jennifer Seipel

## Background

The ARF team, part of the Accredited Reps Crew within the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) Benefits Portfolio at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), supports accredited representatives in their work with Veterans. Our mission is to create an accessible, modern, and secure online system for accredited representatives. This system is called the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP).

Through ARP, we aim to streamline the use of digital forms, providing a faster and smoother experience for both representatives and the Veterans they serve, ultimately improving the overall VA experience.

The ARP pilot will be released to select pilot participants in March 2025. In the ARP pilot, accredited representatives can accept power of attorney (POA) requests that have been submitted using the online [VA Form 21-22 on VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/get-help-from-accredited-representative/appoint-rep/introduction/). The focus of our research will be testing the pilot functionality and learning more from participants about what they expect to see in the future of the portal.

[Product Brief: Accredited Representative Portal](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/vaabdvro/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B9CCA6503-B180-4788-8F13-9FC6C4133604%7D&file=Brief%20-%20Accredited%20Representative%20Product%20Opportunity%20Space%20August%202024.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)

[Problem Overview: Form 21-22 (Power of Attorney)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/accredited-representative-facing/21-22-power-of-attorney.md)

## Research Goals

1. Evaluate usability of ARP, searching and accepting/declining a POA request.
2. Understand accredited representative workflows more fully, especially related to POA.
3. Understand high-level organizational procedures of a small NE state VSO, in this case being Connecticut Veterans Affairs.

### Outcome

This research will uncover any initial usability issues with ARP pilot that need to be addressed before releasing our product to a broader audience of accredited representatives. The additional insights we gather about organizational processes and representative workflows will help guide the future direction and designs for ARP.

### Research Questions

1. **Goal:** Evaluate usability of ARP, searching and accepting/declining a POA request:
    - Can representatives complete tasks quickly and efficiently through this design, or could it be improved?
    - Is the information/content clearly presented, or are there any points of confusion?
2. **Goal:** Understand accredited representative workflows more fully:
    - What technologies and processes do reps use?
        - Devices, screen size, tools/apps, when they work online vs. Offline?
    - What activities happen before, during, and after accepting a POA request?
        - What information do reps want to search POA requests by?
        - Do reps want to submit intent to file (ITF) immediately after accepting a POA request?
        - What do reps want to be informed/notified about the POA request?
    - What differences, if any, are there between small and large org approach to accepting POA?
        - How do they determine who reviews what POA requests? By geographic area? By rep requested? What else?
        - Do larger orgs require different search or filter options?
    - What other functionality is required for reps to fully adopt ARP?
3. **Goal:** To understand high-level organizational procedures of a small NE state VSO, in this case being Connecticut Veterans Affairs.
    - What technologies and processes are used in your organization?
        - What % of claimant meetings are in-person vs. virtual?
        - Are any of your reps using assistive technology?
    - What is the role of a VSO manager/supervisor?
        - How do you manage or monitor quality?
        - How do you delegate and manage workloads, POA requests, other work?

### Hypothesis

We think reps will:

- Easily find and accept a POA request
- Be excited they can see the Veteran information in VBMS within minutes of accepting POA
- Want more functionality, wonder what we plan on building next and how soon
- Want to update their contact information directly in the portal

About searching

- All reps will want to search requests by first name, last name, and/or SSN
- Cross-accredited reps and reps from larger orgs will want/need more granular search and filter options than smaller orgs. Needs will vary depending on an organization’s work processes.

## Methodology

#### Semi-structured interview

- **Paul Spedaliere, John S Carragher, Jeannie Gardine** (CT Veterans Affairs leadership): Conversation to learn how they manage tools, quality, case loads, and processes

#### Weekly Feedback prompts during pilot

- **13 CT pilot participants** / Microsoft Teams feedback channel & tech support
- Research prompts will be posted every Friday morning through the pilot asking participants to give brief responses
  - Week 1-2 more broad, general questions
  - Week 3+ more specific, targeted questions on areas we want to explore deeper

#### Walkthrough, usability testing, concept testing, semi-structured interviews

- **4-5 pilot participants** / 1:1 sessions
  - Walkthrough of accepting/declining POA request: using ARP pilot environment
  - Concept testing: using Figma search/filter screens
- **4-5 non-pilot participants** / 1:1 sessions
  - Usability testing: using ARP staging (or clickable Figma prototype)
  - Concept testing: using Figma search/filter screens
- Followed by semi-structured interviews

### Location

- Remote: Microsoft Teams video calls
- Remote: Microsoft Teams group chats (Weekly Feedback & Get Help channels)
