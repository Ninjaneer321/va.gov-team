## Research Goals
The Accredited Representative Facing Team is seeking to re-envision the Accredited Representative experience so that they can more seamlessly and accurately help Veterans with their VA interactions, including helping Veterans apply for, manage, and update their VA benefits.

Our initial focus is on the process of accepting the power of attorney (POA) given in Form 21-22 which appoints a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) as a Veteran’s representative, giving them POA.

### OCTO Priorities
**Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.**
- **Key Result 2:** Number of transactions processed during our products have increased by 25%.
- **Key Result 3:** All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.
- **Key Result 4:** No transactions accepted by our products have a fatal error.
After years of focusing exclusively on Veterans who want to interact directly with VA, we will build tools for Veterans who want to work with accredited representatives, and the reps who support those Veterans. In doing so, we will redirect to VA.gov traffic currently going through [eBenefits](https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/ebenefits/homepage) and [Stakeholder Enterprise Portal](https://www.sep.va.gov/sep/web/guest/sep) (SEP).
Full list of [OCTO-DE priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md).

### Veteran Journey
Any/all points when a Veteran needs support filing and accessing their benefits.

### Goals
- Understand the usability of the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) 21-22 flow on desktop with singly accredited Veterans Service Organization Representatives.
- Understand singly accredited Veterans Service Organization Representatives’ current POA processes and caseloads.

### Outcomes
User testing will inform adjustments to the ARP 21-22 flow to improve usability.
Information about current POA process and caseload will help determine improvements to the authenticated landing page and POA views to decrease cognitive load and facilitate smoother decision making.
Feedback about the unauthenticated and authenticated ARP tool will inform content strategy and exploration of additional functionality required for ARP v1.

## Research Questions
1. Is the purpose and audience for the unauthenticated ARP landing page clear? Is the content valuable? Is there any content missing?
1. Does the sign-in experience meet VSO Representatives’ expectations?
1. What information is most valuable to VSO Representatives on the POA Requests page? Is any information missing?
1. Are navigation categories within ARP clear?
1. Are there any challenges with finding and accepting a specific Veteran’s 21-22 request?
1. Is information about the Veteran/claimant sufficient for making a decision about a 21-22 request? Is there any information missing?
1. What functionality is missing from the 21-22 accept/decline flow?

### Hypotheses
- File/claim number and Social Security number will be the most desired Veteran search functions.
- VSO Representatives want confirmation that the system is working, such as confirmation that an accepted 21-22 has been processed and they now have access to the e-Folder.

## Methodology
**Semi-structured interviews** / The interviewer will ask the representative a series of questions to understand users’ current 21-22 process, from filling it out to submission and acceptance, with a focus on understanding current pain points and mental models. 

**Usability testing** / Accredited representatives will be asked to engage with a prototype of the Accredited Representative Portal (ARP) to test usability, understandability of content, and desirability of features.

**Preference testing** / Partway through the study, we noticed a disconnect between the content on the unauthenticated landing page for ARP and users’ understanding of what the tool could do and who was meant to use it. We made 4 mockups of the unauthenticated landing page’s splash and asked 4 of 9 participants for their feedback.

### Usability test prompts
1. Without clicking on anything, take a moment to review this web page. What are your initial impressions?
1. Let’s pretend you already have an account set up using your PIV card and a PIV card reader is attached to your computer. Go ahead and find the sign in and click it. 
1. Let’s imagine you’ve logged into this tool for the day to manage any incoming POA requests. Is there any information missing on this page that you’d like to see?
1. Let’s imagine a scenario where you spoke to a Veteran named Paula Higashi on the phone and she submitted a 21-22 online through VA.gov. This new tool allows you to accept that 21-22 and quickly establish power of attorney. To start, you just want to view Paula’s request. How would you do this? 
1. From this page, go ahead and accept Paula’s request.
1. Imagine you are tasked with approving all POA requests for your office in Wichita, Kansas. How would you find all requests in your city and then approve them? 
1. Please find and select Gordon Diaz, a Veteran from Valley Center, Kansas, to review their request in more detail. I will paste their information in the chat for you to reference. Without accepting or declining, what do you notice?
1. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being “not at all likely” and 5 being “very likely, how likely would you be to recommend this tool to a VSO colleague?

## Key Findings
1. What we know about singly accredited VSO Representatives.
1. Perceived usability for ARP was high, but observed usability and task success were mixed.
1. Bulk accepting POA requests is not a use case for singly accredited VSO Representatives. 
1. Singly accredited VSO Representatives do not associate accreditation (or OGC) with their daily work.
1. Hypothesis confirmed: file/claim number and Social Security number are the most desired Veteran and POA search functions for ARP.
1. Hypothesis confirmed: because of a history of unreliable tools in the VA ecosystem, VSO Representatives need high visibility into the ARP system, such as confirmation that an accepted 21-22 form has been processed and the VSOR now has access to the claimant’s e-Folder.

## Details of Key Findings

### Key finding 1 
**What we know about singly accredited Veterans Service Organization Representatives.**
We asked participants about their current role, work context and case load in an effort to update our persona to reflect nuances within VSOR subgroups (See updated persona).
