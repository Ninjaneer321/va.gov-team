## Overview
This project's objective is to allow Veterans' nursing home officials to submit supporting evidence to justify Aid & Attendance or Housebound benefits which increases their monthly compensation or pension benefits.

## Problem Statement
A Request for Nursing Home Information in Connection with Claim for Aid and Attendance (VA Form 21-0779) is completed in order to provide supporting documentation for an Aid and Attendance benefit claim when the Veteran is a resident of a nursing home. The nursing home in which the Veteran resides completes the form provide the Veteran's medical needs and the level of care required. This information helps the VA to determine eligibility for increased pension payments to cover long-term care costs. 

How might we provide a way for nursing home officials to submit the Veteran's medical needs in support of an Aid and Attendance claim?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Nursing home officials can submit VA Form 21-0779 on VA.gov

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Nursing home officials will prefer submitting a paper version of the form 


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Employees at the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) are able to process requests quicker

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- There is an increased time in processing requests

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._
