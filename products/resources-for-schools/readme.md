# Project Name: Resources for Schools

### Problem Statement

The Resources for Schools page (formerly called the SCO page - School Certifying Officials page) is used by SCOs and school administrators to guide Veterans using their GI Bill benefits. Administrators and SCOs refer to this page for training, news, office hours, and daily tasks and the page required an update to remain useful and relevant to the SCOs.

### Solution Statement

The IIR team stepped in to assist in Q1 2024. After conducting research with SCOs through workgroups and interviews, the team redesigned and launched a new page in March of 2024. Based on user feedback, the new page displays all the relevant links and tools for SCOs as they work to ensure Veterans have access to their GI Bill benefits.

### Key Findings
* Users prioritized easy access to Enrollment Manager, which is a crucial part of their daily work.
* Users did not differentiate between the different types of handbooks the same way VA does (such as the VR&E handbook and SCO handbook) and requested that handbooks be consolidated under a distinct section.
* Users desired visibility to updates and trainings, such as Office Hours, and emphasized that when training new SCOs, signing up for GovDelivery was a necessity.

### Next steps 
* Page was launched with updates in March 2024. Additional UI changes may be made based upon feedback given to the Resources for Schools team through the Feedback button

### Change log

* Liza McRuer, 27 March 2024 - Created doc and added links
