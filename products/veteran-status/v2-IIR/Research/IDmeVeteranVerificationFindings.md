## Overview  
ID.me enables U.S. veterans to verify their military status and unlock exclusive discounts. Veterans include former members of the U.S. military who served in any branch (Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Navy, Space Force, NOAA Corps, U.S. Public Health Service) and were discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.

---

## Eligibility  
Veterans who qualify for ID.me verification must meet these criteria:
- Must have previously served in the U.S. military.
- Discharged under conditions other than dishonorable.  
- Veterans with less than honorable discharges are not eligible.

## Proof of Service  
To verify status, veterans can upload one of the following documents:

### **Primary Documents**:
- **DD214 Form**: Must indicate discharge status (e.g., honorable or general discharge).  
- **State-Issued Driver’s License or ID Card**: Must include a veteran endorsement or designation.  
- **Honorable Discharge Certificate**: Official proof of honorable discharge.  
- **NGB Form 22**: For National Guard veterans, showing proof of service and discharge.  
- **Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC)** or **Veteran Identification Card (VIC)**: Official cards issued by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  
- **Reserve Separation Orders**: Proof of discharge from the Reserve forces.

### **Key Requirements for Documents**:
- Documents must clearly show the veteran’s full name and discharge status.
- Expired documents are acceptable as long as they meet the above criteria.
