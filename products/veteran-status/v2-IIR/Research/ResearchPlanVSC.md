# Research Plan for Innovate, Iterate, & Run (IIR) Team - Veteran Status Card (VSC)

**Background**

- **Problem:** The current Veteran Status Card (VSC) experience is inconsistent and difficult to use across web and mobile platforms based on an internal audit. Unclear usage and difficulty to access both can behindering Veterans from utilizing its benefits.
- **Location:** The VSC is found within a Veteran's profile on VA.gov, in the authenticated experience.
- **Familiarity:** Veterans may be aware of the VSC but may not be familiar with its current functionality or how to access it.
- **Product Iteration:** This is an iteration on an existing product, aiming to improve accessibility and usability.

**OCTO Priorities**

This research supports the OCTO priority:

- 1.3**:** All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.
- 2.2: Our platforms measure and improve the satisfaction of their internal users.

**Veteran Journey**

The VSC plays a role in the Veteran's journey by allowing them to easily access and utilize discounts and memberships offered to them. It should be readily available and convenient to use at any point in their post-service life.

**Research Goals**

1. **Understand the challenges and opportunities** associated with verifying Veteran status for both Veterans and businesses.
2. **Evaluate the usability and effectiveness** of the current VSC design and functionality.
3. **Identify opportunities for improvement** in the verification process and VSC design to enhance user experience and streamline the process.

**Outcome**

This research will inform the redesign of the VSC and the development of a streamlined verification process. It will create a user-centered approach to improve accessibility, user flow, and efficiency for both Veterans and businesses. Learnings from this research will be used to develop a revised prototype for further testing.

**Research Questions**

**Part 1: Verification Process**

- **RQ1:** What are the most common scenarios where Veterans need to prove their status?
- **RQ2:** What methods do Veterans currently use to verify their status, and how effective are these methods?
- **RQ3:** What are the primary challenges Veterans face when attempting to prove their status?

**Part 2: VSC Redesign**

- **RQ4:** What are the usability issues and pain points associated with the current Veteran Status Card?
- **RQ5:** How do Veterans perceive the redesigned Veteran Status Card in terms of ease of use, functionality, and overall satisfaction?

**Hypothesis**

We hypothesize that Veterans encounter challenges in the current verification process and VSC experience. By understanding these challenges and conducting usability testing, we can identify opportunities to improve accessibility, create a more intuitive design, and streamline the verification process for both Veterans and businesses.

**Methodology**

This research will utilize a combination of methods:

- **Semi-structured Interviews:** To gain a deeper understanding of Veteran and business experiences with the VSC and verification process.
- **Usability Testing:** To evaluate the current VSC design and user flow on both web and mobile platforms.

**Location**

Remote sessions conducted via Zoom.

**Research Materials**

- **Conversation Guide:** A guide will be developed to ensure consistent questioning across interviews.
- **Live website/app (figma):** Participants will walk moderator through their current experience with accessing the VSC via mobile web or app.
- **Prototype Link (figma):** Participants will walk moderator through the prototype experience with accessing the VSC via mobile web or app.

**Recruitment**

- **Audience:** Veterans who have used or attempted to use the VSC in the past.
- **Approach:** Perigean will be used to recruit participants with a focus on a lean maximum variation sample to ensure diverse representation among Veterans and businesses.
- **Criteria:**
    - **Primary:** Veterans who have used or attempted to use the VSC on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) or VA app.
    - **Secondary:** Veterans with varying levels of experience using technology and mobile applications.

**Timeline**

- Research Review submission: 2-4 weeks before session
- Pilot Session (Mobile web): Date and participant to be confirmed.
- Pilot Session (Mobile app): Date and participant to be confirmed.
- Research Sessions: Dates and times to be confirmed based on participant availability (availability information to be provided after scheduling).
