# Research Plan for Rainbows, VIC landing page, Date TBD

## Goals

This research is a result of the findings of the [previous research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-id-cards/landing-page/results-summary.md) on the usability of the Veteran ID Card Landing page, in which many participants indicated how useful it would be to have some sort of visual aid to help them understand the ID cards that are presented on the page.
1. This document outlines another round of research for the new VIC landing page.
2. [Background of the VIC intiative overall](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-id-cards), [goals of this landing page here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-id-cards/landing-page/project-brief.md)
3. Research questions
    - Are the illustrated versions of the various identification cards accurate representations of their physical counterparts?
    - Are Veterans able to recognize the illustrations?

## Method 
- This research will be done using a chalkmark test so that it can be distributed to a wide audience and completed asynchronously. [Here is a preview](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/chalkmark/4d8j4405).

## Participants and Recruitment
1. Participant criteria: 
    - The goal is to get at least 100 responses, and distribute to at least 250 potential participants. All of the participants should be Veterans or Servicemembers.

2. Recruiting 
    - TBD

## When? 
1. Timeline: TBD
