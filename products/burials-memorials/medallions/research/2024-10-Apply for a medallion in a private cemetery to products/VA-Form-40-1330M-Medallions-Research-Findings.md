## Research Goals
_The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is working to modernize its systems, including the system that processes medallion applications (Form 40-1330M) for determining eligibility for a government medallion to affix to a private marker (VA Form 40-1330M). Currently, family members, VSO officers, funeral homes, cemeteries, and personal representatives do not have a digitized form that allows them to request a medallion for a Veteran buried in a private cemetery with a privately purchased headstone or marker. The Medallions application applies to life stage of Dying, as Veteran’s family members, personal representatives, or Veteran Service Officers can apply for a medallion to affix to a private marker in a private cemetery at the time of death – or at any point after the Veteran’s death._
_[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)_

The purpose of this research was to:
- Goal 1: Design a form that is straightforward and inclusive of the information needed to determine eligibility for a medallion. 
- Goal 2: Test the usability of the medallions digital form and multiple signature solution to ensure that it is easily usable and accessible for applicants. 
- Goal 3: Identify pain points that may hinder user’s ability to complete the form and multiple signature solution, confirming users understand the application process thoroughly from beginning to end.

## Research Questions

-	*Are users adequately equipped to begin this form, ensuring confidence throughout its completion?*
-	*Does the content adhere to the most intuitive and user-friendly experience?*
-	*What specific sections of our form pose the greatest challenges for users?* 
-	*Is the form’s structure proficient in guiding users through the process?* 
-	*Does the organization and content provided help guide the users step-by-step?* 
-	*What can we do to streamline the information for users to make it clearer and easier to understand?* 
-	*What questions do users have before and after completing the form?*



## Methodology 

_We conducted remote usability testing sessions with Zoom using a clickable, interactive prototype of the Medallion and Multiple Signatures designs.
Participants were given a link to open the prototype that they could navigate through to complete a scenario assigned to them.
Users were interviewed about their prior Medallions knowledge in addition to being asked questions to assess how experienced they are with VA.gov digital forms.
Notes from the moderator, notetakers, and observers were then synthesized to form findings and recommendations._
**Scenarios**
- 4 Participants completed the application as a Veteran's family member
- 4 Participants completed the application as a funeral home representative
- All participants were asked to fill out the second form as a cemetery representative


## Hypotheses and Conclusions


- **Understand the language used to differentiate between applicant and Veteran**
  - TRUE  Users generally understood whose information to enter in the applicant and Veteran information sections.
- **Find the form straight to the point and user friendly**
  - DEFINITELY TRUE  All users found the form to be simple and straightforward. 
- **Be able to move through the form and ultimately order a medallion for the Veteran quickly and with ease**
  -	DEFINITELY TRUE –All users were able to complete both the medallions and multiple signatures forms.
- **Spend less time reading and more time getting through questions quickly based on conciseness**
  -	LIKELY TRUE Users were able to navigate through the forms quickly, stopping for help if needed using the links and additional help components.
- **Understand the requirements needed to apply for a medallion and multiple signatures** 
  -	MAYBE TRUE  Users understood what was needed to apply for a medallion, and that there would be a second signature required by the cemetery after the first  form had been completed. 
- **Experience confusion on who is eligible for this benefit**
  - LIKELY FALSE Users generally understood who would be eligible for this benefit, but we found that some additional guidance is needed to better explain the requirements specifically for a Medal of Honor medallion.
- **Have questions about what happens after they apply and how the multiple signature process works**
  -	LIKELY FALSE Users generally understood that they would need an additional second signature to be able to receive this benefit.


## Key Findings


1.	Nearly all participants felt reassured by the help links and additional info components.
2.	Nearly all participants voluntarily opted in to Veteran demographics questions.
3.	Some users were hesitant to enter Veteran information if they didn’t know for sure.
4.	Most participants generally understood questions regarding burial and claimed remains but made assumptions about eligibility requirements regarding cremation.
5.	Some participants experienced confusion around medallion type and sizing.
6.	All participants completed the two-part application process, saying it was quick and straightforward.
7.	Address validation was familiar and easily understood by most participants.



## Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible. Please **add relevant keywords/labels to your findings** selected from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc).

**1. Nearly all participants felt reassured by the help links and additional info components**

Labels: PRDT: Burials-memorials, BNFT: Memorialization 

- 7/8 participants utilized additional info components or help links throughout the application.
- Several participants said that they would call the help line with questions about the application process.
- 1 participant explained that they like the link to open in a new tab so that it would not disrupt the current application process.
- 1 participant said that they would use the help to obtain information about the cemetery contact.



> _“I like that you have the link where you can learn more about stuff. - Having to learn more about it would be helpful because I don’t have a clue of what it is.” - P13_

> _“Presidential memorial certificate, I would need to click learn more about it” - P2_

> _“I like that the learn more opens in a different tab so it doesn’t interrupt the application.” - P3_

> _"As I am going through this and I see continue, my eyes go to need help and I can call the 800 number from M-F from 8am to 730pm if I have questions. Even with it being there I can I know it’s there and I can call with questions.” - P4_

> _“You can get the presidential memorial and the learn more opens in a different tab so that’s nice. I can click on it to learn and I would like it so click yes.” - P4_

> _“I would click on the certificate link because I don’t know what it is from the title”  - P6_

**2. Nearly all participants opted in to Veteran demographics questions.**

Labels: label 1, label 2 

-	7/8 participants opted in to Veteran demographic questions.
-	1 participant opted out of Veteran demographic questions because they said they would not know that information as an organization contact (funeral home.)
-	1 participant said that they would not answer the demographics questions unless they knew for sure, or they would select “prefer not to answer.”
-	1 participant did not like the “prefer not to answer” answer for race, ethnicity, or sex questions.

> _“I would voluntarily answer the demographics.” - P4_

> _“Okay, sure. I guess because on my background I work in the science field so it helps with that statistics. It’s not personal information so it doesn’t feel wrong.” P6_

>_“If I knew I would answer the demographics but nowadays it can be challenging. I would say no unless I knew for sure.” – P2_

>_“Race and gender is fine I would select yes. That page is fine to me it is just asking race, its fine to me.” – P12_

>_“I don’t have a problem with the demographic question so I would put yes. P7"_
