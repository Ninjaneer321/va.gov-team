## Background
VA Form 21P-530 (Application for Burial Benefits) enables eligible individuals to apply for compensation to help cover burial, funeral, and transportation costs. We know “often the first time a Veteran’s family interacts directly with VA is during a high-emotional time of a Veteran’s death.”

Our team aimed to better understand the claimants’ mental models regarding the Burial Benefits form, primarily through the insights of Veterans Service Officers (VSOs), County Veterans Service Officers (CVSOs), and National Service Officers (NSOs). We aimed to identify which sections of the form need clarification and what factors create obstacles, such as drop-offs and delays in the application process.   

## Research Goals
Our goals for this study are the following:

- Understand how VSOs support claimants through the application and post-submission process
- Understand VSOs’ experiences working with claimants and the claimant’s experience by proxy
- Understand what impedes claimants from continuing the Burial benefits form


## Research Questions
- Understand how VSOs support claimants
   - **What brings claimants to seek VSO support?**
   - **What areas of the application VSOs may need to clarify?**
   - What tools do they use to help claimants apply for Burial benefits?
   - What are the typical causes for issuing development letters when working on the Burial Benefits application?
- Understand VSOs’ experiences working with claimants and the claimant’s experience by proxy.
   - Understand the claimant by proxy: Is it typically family members, friends, caretakers, etc.? What are the claimant’s environment, factors, behaviors, and feelings about the Burial benefits from by proxy through VSOs?
   - **What is the VSOs’ mental model of Burial, the Burial application,  Burial service, behaviors, and sentiments?**
   - How do they verify that the claimant is a relative, friend, etc., of the deceased Veteran?
- Understand what impedes claimants from continuing the Burial benefits form
   - **What may stop someone from applying for the burial benefits form online or on paper?**
   - Why do claimants not complete and successfully submit the Burial benefits form?
   - **What sections of the application do claimants need more assistance with?**
   - **What information is most critical?**
   - Why might an application be delayed or denied?


## Methodology 

We conducted semi-structured interviews with six VSOs who assisted claimants in completing the Burial Benefits form. Three of the six VSOs had previously participated in the VSO Pension research.

This research was part of the VSO pilot led by Lesly Ropp and Dené Gabaldón. We followed the research guidelines provided by the VSO pilot team. Participants were selected from the existing volunteered-based VSO pilot database. Our team sent recruitment emails and utilized Microsoft Bookings to enable participants to schedule interview sessions with us using Microsoft Teams.


### Participants
We aimed to gather insights from Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), County Veterans Service Officers (CVSOs), and National Service Officers (NSOs) across various states, including both rural, urban, and suburban areas. Additionally, we sought input from regional offices, Veteran service organizations, Veteran charity organizations, and other accredited entities. It was crucial for our research to interview VSOs from this diverse array of groups to ensure our findings are generalizable and applicable to a wide range of claimants. This approach has helped us prevent bias from focusing on a single group and allowed us to capture different perspectives based on geography and VSO accreditation.

We interviewed a total of six participants across 5 different states: California, Missouri, Minnesota, Nevada and Pennsylvania (2)

- 1 VSO
- 2 CVSOs
- 2 SVSOs
- 2 NSOs 
- 3 from rural areas
- 3 from urban/suburban areas
- 4 worked in regional offices
   - North Dakota Department of Veteran Affairs (NDDVA)
   - California Association of County Veteran Service Officers (CACVSO)
   - Minnesota Brown County VSO
   - Nevada Department of Veteran Services
- 2 worked in Veteran charity organizations
   - Wounded Warrior
   - Disabled American Veterans (DAV) 

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

The study could show that claimants who receive support from VSOs have an easier time completing the Burial Benefits form and gathering all the supporting evidence, leading to less application processing time.

Mostly true. While VSOs support claimants by preparing them for the Burial Benefits, obtaining as much supporting evidence on their behalf, reducing the application process, and giving claimants a lower risk for obtaining development letters, VSOs still need to wait on some information and supporting evidence from the claimant, such as the receipt of all the expenses. 


## Key Findings

1. The typical claimants are spouses and children of the deceased Veteran. VSOs rarely work with extended family, friends, caregivers, funeral homes, state cemeteries and executors.
2.	Claimants face emotional challenges, including grief and the stress of navigating bureaucratic processes during a time of loss   
3.	VSOs support Veterans' end-of-life journey by preparing them and their families for burial benefits.
4.	VSOs have indicated that application process delays are common, primarily due to the need for supporting documents. These delays can range from 7 days to 90 days and, in rare instances, may extend up to a year.
5.	 VSOs help obtain supporting evidence during the Burial Benefits application process and reduce delays.
6.	Many claimants mistakenly believe Burial Benefits will fully cover funeral expenses, unaware it is a reimbursement for specific costs, not a full payment for services
7.	Claimants find some of the terminology used in the form confusing and hard to understand.
8.	VSOs offer DIC benefits to surviving spouses and suggest streamlining the process for service-connected Veterans. Requires additional validation.



## Details of Findings 

### Who tends to file for Burial Benefits
**1) We identified that the typical claimants are spouses and children of the deceased Veteran. VSOs rarely work with extended family, friends, caregivers, funeral homes, state cemeteries, and executors.**
   
Most VSOs primarily assist the surviving spouse and child of the deceased Veteran. They rarely engage with extended family, friends, or executors, although some have partnerships with state cemeteries and work with funeral homes. 
One VSO (P7) mentioned he collaborates with funeral directors and noted that funeral directors actively help claimants complete the Burial Benefits form. However, since the reimbursement amounts are not specified on the paper form, another VSO (P6) pointed out that some funeral homes may use unethical tactics with claimants unfamiliar with the VA or the Burial Benefits process. These funeral homes might convince claimants to pay more by falsely claiming that the VA will cover the costs when, in fact, that is not the case. More research is needed to verify these statements.

> _“It's usually the next of kin (NOK), the family members. Surviving spouse. The son or daughter, that sort of thing. There have been one or two [executors], but let's see. I've been doing this job for about 7 years, and those are few and far between. We may get one every other year. And I think we've maybe had one, maybe two, unclaimed veterans that we've done, a burial for the Funeral Home who was claiming it - P1_

> _“I think some of that might be some unsavory tactics to get them to spend more money on a funeral, and all of a sudden, you say, ‘Nope, you're only going to get this much.’ But they spent so much more with the funeral, and then you gotta explain. It's not even a part of that. The funeral expenses aren't what can be reimbursed.” - P6_

In rare cases, Veterans who do not have living family members or those who are unclaimed may require assistance from state cemeteries or funeral home. Some VSOs indicated that they only collaborate with funeral homes for unclaimed remains of deceased Veterans. In contrast, other VSOs work directly with state cemeteries. For instance, one VSO (P6) located near a state cemetery mentioned that they refer claimants to complete the Burial Benefits form if the Veteran is buried there. Since the state cemetery is close to their office, this VSO noted that it is a smoother process for claimants to visit the cemetery and have staff assist them in completing the Burial Benefits form.

> _“I've done one for a Funeral Home that ended up covering the cost of a Veteran who had no family members, but that was completely different... it was an unclaimed Veteran.” - P5_

> _ “I believe the cemetery has to submit the same form because they can claim it. So, instead of having to do multiple forms for one Veteran and one for the spouse, we just get it all done. One stop shop down there, and it's less confusing for them to talk to me about the Burial Benefit that's entitled to them versus them…  It's just a lot smoother process, but if it's a civilian cemetery, which I've had a few of those, then yeah, I'll do that one.” - P6_


### Navigating Veteran End-of-Life, Death, Burial, and the Claimants' Experience
#### 2) Emotional Burden of Navigating deaths and burials
   
All the VSOs understand the intense emotions claimants experience when applying for Burial Benefits. They recognize that the process often overwhelms claimants, especially during difficult times.

Some VSOs noted that spouses often feel overwhelmed with the responsibilities of planning everything from the funeral to the burial. If claimants visit the VSO office before the funeral, some VSOs encourage them to return once they have managed those arrangements. They will also prepare them by giving them a checklist of all the supporting evidence they might need to apply for the Burial Benefits when ready. 

> _“I make it as easy as I can for somebody who is grieving. I don't want them to get multiple letters. And we run with what we have instead of trying to put more stuff on the spouse. It can be overwhelming..” - P6
“They have enough to worry about already, and they're already grieving. They're already trying to plan a funeral and do all this other stuff like adjusting to life without their spouse.” - P1_

> _“Someone is reaching out because they are overwhelmed, they're grieving, and they're asked to do so much during this time.” - P7_

To assist, the VSOs do everything possible to simplify the application by preparing Veterans and their families for the Veteran’s end-of-life (See finding 3), gathering all the necessary supporting documents (See finding 5) and even suggesting additional benefits (See finding 8) such as DIC for surviving spouses. One VSO noted that their offices provide counseling support to help claimants navigate this challenging experience.

> _“I know this is a complicated process. We have my office offering grieving counseling. And there's a women's support group and a spousal support group. We don't have any male ‘spouses there yet. But it's a spouse and support group.” - P3_

> _“Let's make sure we have everything in place to make sure the Veterans properly honored... And you and your family have a have the peace... And we encourage [claimants] to come, come back in and visit our offices after that funeral with the receipts and the things we need that we've talked about to file that claim. 'Cause, it's a hard time in everybody's life. I'm not trying to slam a claim together. - P3_

> _“All the spouses stressed out. She's already stressed out. [I tell them] this money's not going to come right away. In the grand scheme of things, two weeks is not going to matter. You're still going to have to go to Social Security. It's going to have a lot of things we've got to do. We going to get your finances in order so that we can find out if maybe you might be entitled to a pension.” - P3_

##### Recommendation: 
- HMW put less burden on claimants during the Burial Benefits application process.
- Consider automating and auto-populating as much information we can about the deceased Veteran.


#### 3) The role VSOs play in supporting end-of-life and Veteran deaths

VSOs play a crucial role in supporting Veterans during their end-of-life planning. They provide outreach to educate Veterans and their families about Burial Benefits and actively seek out families of recently deceased Veterans.

VSOs educate Veterans about end-of-life matters when they seek assistance. During a Veteran’s first visit to a VSO office, the staff proactively informs them about all available benefits, emphasizing preparing for Burial Benefits. To help Veterans understand their options, VSOs typically provide informational packets outlining all the VA benefits they may be eligible for, including Burial Benefits. Along with this information, VSOs offer a checklist to ensure Veterans and their families understand the required supporting documents. Most VSOs emphasize the importance of this checklist when discussing burial benefits with them.
Additionally, VSOs tell Veterans to have their spouses come in when they pass, and they will help them with everything. Because of this, most claimants who contact a VSO either had a previous relationship with them or the deceased Veteran had a relationship with them.

> _“Someone should write a book on what to do after the death of a loved one. Some people are pretty lost.” - P4_

> _“We tell our Veterans, don't try to do this alone. Just have your spouse come to us, and we'll do it for them. They have enough to worry about already, and they're already grieving. They're already trying to plan a funeral and do all this other stuff like adjusting to life without their spouse.” - P1_

> _“70 to 80% of our burial benefit business it is because we had already established a relationship with the Veteran when they were still alive” - P6_

Other VSOs actively provide outreach efforts to speak to and prepare Veterans for their end-of-life. Some VSOs work with nursing homes and brief Veterans about Burial Benefits. They also share resources about spouse benefits after their death. VSOs mentioned that a few Veterans get their families together and visit a VSO to plan their departure. However, many Veterans and their families are overwhelmed and struggle to prepare for the Veteran’s death due to a lack of sufficient information they have access to, leading to challenges with funeral, burial, and plot expenses. 

> _“There are some Veterans who prepare. They get their spouses prepared. They put packages of paperwork together and stuff like that, but I would say 90% of the people who walk in our office have hardly any clue about survivors' benefits as a whole. And I would say probably most people in the civilian side don't know what resources are out there for them if they pass away because people don't like to think about that” - P5_

> _“I think it's because a lot of the time they don't want to think about their own mortality and their own death. So many times when we have a surviving spouse come in, they don't even know they're entitled to Burial allowances. They just know they were told to come to the VA or DAV when the Veteran passes away. And that we'll tell them what they need to do.” - P5_

> _“We have Veterans who contact us all the time and say I want to know what benefits are there for my spouse. Should I pass away before then? And we'll send them a rundown, or schedule a time to talk to them and their spouse together and explain to them both. So there's no misunderstanding.” - P5_

> _“There's a lot of struggling families that don't plan.” - P3_

Lastly, VSOs utilize various methods to find the families of recently deceased Veterans. Some organizations monitor obituaries and send condolence or sympathy letters, while others maintain active subscriptions with funeral homes, allowing them to receive emails that they sort through to identify Veterans.

> _“Our Cass County office checks the local obituaries for Veterans passing and sends the Sympathy Letter to the Next of Kin (NOK). Often, a surviving spouse or NOK will not know there are benefits available after the Veteran’s passing. - P1_

> _“We have a subscription with funeral homes. So, whenever they post an obituary, we get an e-mail. We get a couple of 100 emails from nonveterans as well, but it's really good to have it right there. We listen to the local radio station too.” - P4_

##### Recommendation: 
- Ensure that we are preparing Veterans and their families for the death of the Veteran
- HMW leverage ways VSOs prepare Veteran and their families in our digital space?
- HMW reach out to claimants after the death of a Veteran?


#### 4) Timeframe for navigating death and burial

VSOs informed us that many delays could occur during the application process. Most of these delays are caused by the need for supporting documents, and they can last from 7 days to 90 days and, in rare cases, up to a year. 

Some VSOs mentioned that obtaining all the receipts from a claimant could take some time. It can take 30 days to get the bill. Others noted that for claimants who do not have the deceased Veteran’s DD214, it could take 90 days to verify it. However, before contacting the archive, VSOs try to be resourceful in obtaining the DD214 and try other means, such as ancestry.com, military branches, and even the Mormon church. 

Others mentioned that the death certificate could take the longest. It could take from 7-10 days to even a year to be released if there’s an investigation regarding the death of the Veteran. And if there’s an investigation, the VSO won’t be able to proceed with the application until the death certificate has been released. One VSO mentioned that there could be delays with interment. They noted that they had a case where the ground where the Veteran was going to be buried was frozen. They had to wait several months until the spring to bury the Veteran, and only then did they submit the Burial Benefits form to make sure the VA would accept it. 

> _“He passed in the middle of winter. So he wasn't actually interred yet because the ground was frozen, so they couldn't bury him until the spring once the ground had defrosted. We filled out the form but held onto it because I didn't want it to get rejected by the VA asking for proof of burial. So we waited until after the ceremony and after he was buried before we submitted it.” - P6_

> _“Occasionally, we get a death from out of state, and we have difficulty getting those death certificates, especially if it's myself having to run that down.” - P4_

> _“I've had a couple of those where there's an investigated death where they won't release a death certificate…I've had a couple that have gone on for several months and almost a year. The cause of death was part of an investigation of a crime.” - P5_

> _“Unless there are underlying circumstances where they're trying to determine A cause of death, they're usually good within seven to 10 days.” - P7_

> _“We instruct claimants not to come to see us or not make an appointment until they have the funeral receipt hand, which can be up to 30 days because we're going to be submitting a funeral bill to validate for the plot along with opening and closing of the plot..” - P4_

##### Recommendation: 
- Clearly outline the expected time frames for obtaining supporting documents.
- Review the checklist one of the VSO participants shared to ensure claimants know what supporting documents. HMW provide this service digitally? [(see folder “Documents received from VSOs”)](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared_Documents/Pension/Burial/VSO_Research/Documents_received_from-VSOs?csf=1&web=1&e=gMfrBu)


#### 5) The role VSOs play in obtaining evidence

VSOs will try to obtain as much supporting evidence as possible before placing the responsibility on the claimant. They will inform claimants about all the necessary documentation required for a successful application. This includes the deceased Veteran’s DD214, the death certificate, an itemized receipt for all incurred expenses, and, in some cases, the deceased Veteran’s medical records.

As mentioned earlier, VSOs will also give claimants a checklist to ensure they know all the supporting evidence a claimant might need. [(see folder “Documents received from VSOs”)](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared_Documents/Pension/Burial/VSO_Research/Documents_received_from-VSOs?csf=1&web=1&e=gMfrBu). 

VSOs also try to obtain the deceased Veteran’s DD214 and death certificate to reduce the burden on the claimant and to reduce the time it takes to prepare the Burial Benefits application. As soon as they get power of attorney (POA), they can access the deceased Veteran’s information and decide what additional supporting evidence is needed. One VSO noted that the claimant might not need to submit the DD214. One VSO stated that the claimant might not need to submit the DD214. If the VSO discovers that the deceased Veteran has been receiving benefits or is enrolled in VA healthcare. In that case, they can confirm that the Veteran’s service has been verified, meaning they won’t request a DD214. Another VSO (P1) mentioned that their county has prioritized the digitization of Veteran DD214, which allows them to include that information on their behalf. 

> _“We're actually in a process right now of digitizing all of the paper DD214s that were in the county's. We’re also trying to get those digitized and put into Vetrospec at the moment. So that's been a huge thing. We're still finding D214s from the Civil War and separation documents. It's incredible.” - P1_

> _“If they're already receiving VA benefits, I'm not concerned with the DD214 because that means VA has already verified them” - P6_

Additionally, other VSOs may request the death certificate for the claimant, further reducing their burden. Some VSOs first try to ask and wait for the claimants to provide the death certificate, and if they don’t find it after a few weeks, they’ll try to find it for them. One VSO mentioned that their office does not ask for a death certificate because their company generates it. More research should be done to understand how many VSO offices do this. 

The supporting document VSOs must wait on the claimant is the receipt of all expenses incurred. Sometimes, VSOs will also ask for the claimants’ marriage certificate. My team did not incur on the deceased Veteran’s medical information, so more research will need to be done to know how VSOs help claimants with this supporting evidence.   

> _“We don't ask them for a death certificate. Because they have certificates generated by our company anyway, through the reporter's office... Minnesota law allows a Veteran or a veteran service officer One death certificate. At no cost for the purpose of filing a VA benefits” - P4_

All the VSOs noted that they consistently submit the Burial Benefits form through the Fully Developed Claim (FDC) program. Their primary goal is to ensure claimants receive the necessary benefits as quickly as possible. One VSO stated that the VA has also mandated the submission of all forms through the FDC program.

> _“During the transition to the FDC process, VA established the expectation that all claims from CVSOs should be FDCs.” - P4_

Lastly, VSOs help claimants throughout the development of the Burial Benefits. Since they’re familiar with the process, they rarely have issues after submitting the form. Most development letters they deal with come from claimants who have submitted the form themselves. 

> _“Usually the development letters are coming because they did it themselves.” - P3_

##### Recommendation: 
- Identify if the claimant or the deceased Veteran is already receiving VA benefits. We might not need military information for these claimants since the VA has already verified their military history.
- Ensure claimants have included all the necessary information and supporting documents before they submit the form.  


### Comprehension of Burial Benefits and Eligibility

#### 6) Misperception of Burial Benefits and its allowances as similar to compensation rather than a reimbursement

Surviving family members of Veterans often struggle with the VA’s Burial Benefits process, facing confusion regarding covered expenses like transportation and burial plots. VSOs are essential in clarifying the difference in Burial Benefits allowances, helping claimants understand what is reimbursed and under what circumstances. 

Many claimants need help distinguishing between various allowances, particularly the transportation allowance. For example, while some may think it covers transportation to any funeral home, one VSO (P1) explained that it includes transportation to a funeral home for cremation, whereas another VSO (P6) clarified that it only covers transportation to a federal VA cemetery, not a private one.

> _“So I don't think they understand either. I don't think they understand all three [allowances].” - P7_

> _“They can claim the transportation from the place of death to the Funeral Home, even though they've gotten cremated. “- P1_

> _“Make sure that they understand that the transportation costs are only for transportation to a federal VA cemetery because many people may try to get the transportation cost to our state cemetery. And I'd be like not entitled.’” - P6_

Moreover, surviving spouses and children often misunderstand the extent of the VA’s Burial Benefits, incorrectly assuming that most funeral, burial, and plot expenses will be covered by VA. Based on anecdotal information, they may expect the maximum burial benefit of $2,000, but actual reimbursements are typically much lower, around $300. VSOs help manage these expectations by explaining which specific costs are reimbursable.

> _“They heard this was what I get when I die. They're going to give me a plot of land and reimburse you for a funeral.” - P3_

> _“It depends on what they hear. They think they'll cover the whole thing or the entire $12,000 expense [they incurred].  And then you have to tell them. No, here's the amount. And they're like, ‘Whoa, well, that means I gotta come up with an additional $11,000.’ The initial impression is that they'll cover the cost. They don't know what percentage.” - P7_

> _“We try to manage if it's a non-service-connected burial, what the expectations are because you want to be honest upfront and truthful to what they're because they're trying to plan, you know, everything will be based on money… They are trying to plan financially for expenses and need to understand what the benefits will be.” - P7_

VSOs mentioned that they had to explain to claimants that only those who pay for the expenses get reimbursed. One VSO mentioned that claimants need to understand that the Burial Benefit is a “reimbursement” and that they need the receipts first. VSOs have to tell claimants that the person whose name was on the receipt must come in and file the claim. Because of this unfamiliarity, sometimes multiple family members try to claim the same benefit, and it can become difficult for the VSO to handle the different family dynamics. 

> _“There could be a kid or seven kids, a wife, but if an ex-wife paid the expenses, then she's the one that's entitled, and they’re like, ‘Well, what about my mom?’ ‘She didn't pay anything’ and I have to keep bringing it up that it is a reimbursement. It would probably help if there was more verbiage saying reimbursement on it instead of allowance. I think that's where they get confused.” - P6_

> _“We've had it where someone else was just trying to claim [Burial Benefits] because they didn't want their stepmom getting the money. And I was like, well, unfortunately, she paid for everything.” - P5_

> _“He wasn't eligible. So, the person who is actually responsible. Legally, according to the will or whatever may not have been the person who actually incurred the expense” - P6_

VSOs also inform claimants about how their specific situations affect reimbursable expenses. For instance, if a claimant chooses a state cemetery, they may not receive a plot allowance since plots at state cemeteries are free of charge. A common issue is that claimants must understand that reimbursement only applies to those who directly pay for the expenses. This often leads to complications when multiple family members attempt to claim the same benefit, creating challenges for VSOs in managing the claims process appropriately.

> _“If you get a free plot, you can't get the plot benefit. Sometimes I'm the bearer of bad news and have to tell them ‘You are not even eligible’" - P6_

> _“I have to manage expectations. I have to ensure that they understand that it is only a reimbursement, that we need to have the receipts first, and that it is not necessarily to pay for all the extra funeral stuff, no flowers.” - P6_

##### Recommendation: 
- Set the expectation that the VA will not cover all expenses but only a small portion.
- Incorporate additional information about how much reimbursement a claimant can get when they apply for Burial Benefits.
- Include the maximum and minimum amounts someone might get depending on their eligibility in the paper form.
- Change “allowance” to “reimbursement,” so claimants understand that receipts are needed to claim Burial Benefits and further explain that the person incurring the expenses should be the person claiming the benefit.
- Explain each type of allowance, specifically transportation allowances, and various scenarios where transportation expenses could be reimbursed

#### 7) Confusion about the terminology used in the form

Claimants find some of the terminology used in the form confusing and hard to understand. We heard claimants are most confused about whether they are “service-connected” vs. “no service-connected." Others don’t understand “unclaimed remains” or what a “file number” is. One VSO (P1) mentioned that some claimants don’t understand the “place of internment.” They might not make the connection that keeping remains at home equates to a private residence. Lastly, some have issues with the military information section. Still, as long as the claimant or the VSO obtains the deceased Veteran’s DD214 or if they are currently receiving benefits, they are fine. 

> _“Explaining service-connected versus non-service-connected is one of the longer portions of the conversation because they always want to believe the sense that the Veterans served. They're entitled to whatever is available out there, and explaining to them that sometimes they are not entitled to benefits is one of the more difficult conversations.” - P5_

> _“There, there's just a whole bunch of stuff. They get confused. A lot of spouses will say, I don't know if it's service-connected or not. They don't understand what that means.” - P6_

> _“The place of burial plot internment site, your final resting place 'cause some people will cremate. They don't always realize the cremation [means the final resting place is] at home, at a private residence“ - P1_

> _“Here's the amount if it's service-connected and if it’s not. If it's transportation cost, you know this is transportation. This is what they'll cover. And if they pass away at the VA Medical Center, here are some of the nuances. And then also if the veteran passed away because the form has a nursing home facility not paid by VA.” - P7_

##### Recommendation: 
- Consider using plain language throughout the form.
- Provide more explanations regarding these terms online and on the paper form: service-connected, not service-connected, file number, and place of interment.


#### 8) Claimants find some of the terminology used in the form confusing and hard to understand

All the VSOs we spoke to mentioned that they try to get the claimants all the benefits they can. They mentioned that they give them a package informing them of the possible benefits they might be eligible to receive. If the claimant is the surviving spouse, they will automatically offer the [Compensation Benefits for Surviving Spouses and Dependents](https://www.va.gov/family-and-caregiver-benefits/survivor-compensation/dependency-indemnity-compensation/) (VA DIC). Most VSOs start applications for DIC before Burial Benefits. Some do this because the spouse will automatically receive the $2,000 maximum Burial benefit amount after submitting a DIC application. Others mentioned that if the Burial benefit is not automatically generated, then they’ll apply for the Burial Benefits. 

Some VSOs suggested submitting a DIC application should automatically trigger a Burial Benefits application. Another VSO indicated that if we know a deceased Veteran is already receiving service-connected benefits, we should streamline the process for those Veterans and not require them to apply separately for Burial Benefits. Further research is needed to explore the connection between DIC and Burial Benefits.

> _“90% of the time, we don't do the 530. We do the DIC claim, which is automatically generated when it is a spouse… I try to be as efficient as possible, knowing that the VA is gonna automatically do the burial benefits when they determine service-connected. So why
do an extra [530] form if I don't have to?” - P6_

> _“Sometimes we have to work backward to get the most benefit for the spouse. So if there is a possibility that she gets the DIC benefits, then we want to do that first.” - P3_

> _“I think it should be like an automatic benefit that is just paid out, without them having to go through this process. There should almost be an option to streamline it to in with the application instead of having to do a whole separate one. If streamlined, the person isn't getting more than $2000 for funeral expenses.” - P5_

> _“They file for survivors' benefits but have no clue about burial benefits. And it could be. I've had claimants come in several years later, and we're like, did you ever file for burial? And they're like, no, I didn't know I could. Like, oh, and then we have to go through, and we have to try and get the paperwork together and file because they didn't know they were able to file for it.” - P5_

> _“If someone is eligible for DIC - service-connected death, boom they get pension and $2000 for burial expenses, whereas, those that are not service-connected, only on a pension at 10% they will not get that amount ” - P6_

##### Recommendation: 
- Research the connection between DIC and Burial Benefits. There’s an opportunity to raise awareness of DIC in the Burial Benefits paper and online forms and vice versa. We can also streamline the process by guiding a surviving spouse to apply for DIC first if the Veteran passes away from service-connected implications.



## Secondary findings

#### Finding 1
Some VSOs advise claimants on what to include in their death certificate to max out benefits from VA.

Some VSOs go the extra mile and advise claimants on what to include in their death certificate to get the most benefits. If the deceased Veteran’s death was service-connected and is not on their death certificate, the surviving spouse will not be eligible for DIC benefits and the max Burial Benefit. So, they emphasize the importance of this being reflected in the deceased Veteran’s death certificate.

> _“Is making sure what's on the death certificate so that he or she could possibly get DIC benefits. Did the Veteran serve in Thailand? Was he in Vietnam? Make sure it says hypertension was on there. You had dementia. I don't care. Make sure hypertension is a contributing factor. Tell the doctors the difference between 0 and $1800 a month for you for the rest of your life. Yeah. Is making sure that we have time to talk to this family and the spouse to make sure the right thing is on the death certificate.” P3_

##### Recommendation: 
- Mention the importance of including when the Veteran passed away from a service-connected implication in their death certificate.


#### Finding 2
VSOs provide support to claimants with language barriers

One VSO (P4) mentioned encountering a surviving spouse with language barriers. Some claimants with language barriers might need to learn they are eligible for benefits and could find the process difficult and frustrating. 

> _“I did have one last year where the surviving spouse was a Filipino woman. She could speak a little broken English, but she relied on her spouse for everything, for driving indoor food, shopping, and making her life here in America. She came in with her sister-in-law .” - P4_

#### Recommendation: 
- Ensure the Burial Benefits form is available in multiple languages, both paper and online. More research should be done to identify which languages


#### Finding 3

VSOs suggested improvements to the Burial Benefits form, including adding bank information fields for direct reimbursements.
At the end of our interview session with all the VSOs, we asked how they would improve the Burial benefits form. One VSO (P1) mentioned that the Pension form asks for the claimant's bank information and wondered why the Burial Benefits form did not. Another VSO (P3) mentioned that claimants generally get paid by check, which could be delayed, and wondered why direct deposit was not part of this form. 

> _“Mail around here right now is very inconsistent. And it can take a while for something to get to you, and then having a check for like $2000 floating around out there. And there's nowhere on like the 530 form in which you can provide a bank account.” - P1_

#### Recommendation: 
- Include bank information on the paper and online forms so claimants can get reimbursement faster.


#### Finding 4
VSOs suggest a 30-60-day timeframe to receive the Burial Benefits

VSOs give claimants a timeline of about 30-60 days. Some VSOs mentioned that it could take 180 days to even a year if the deceased Veteran has never tapped into VA services. Several VSOs mentioned that it was difficult to process the Burial Benefits form when the Veteran never taps into any VA benefit during their lifetime.

> _“He passed in the middle of winter. He wasn't interred yet because the ground was frozen, so they couldn't bury him until the spring once the ground had defrosted. So we waited until after the ceremony and after he was buried before we submitted it.” - P6_

> _“Anytime that we've submitted one, usually it's within 30 or 60 days to get the payment.” - P7_

> _“I would think everyone is being paid within 60 days.” - P4_

#### Recommendation: 
- Clearly outline the expected time frames for receiving Burial Benefits reimbursement


#### Finding 5
VSOs suggested improvements to the award letter and the paper form.

One specific VSO pointed out a big issue with the award letter. He mentioned that even though he didn’t apply for all the different Burial Benefits allowances for a given claimant, the award letter this claimant receives will include language on “denied” benefits to allowances they didn’t apply for, which can be very confusing.

> _“The award letter says we approved your claim for [x benefit], but we denied your claim for transportation. Everyone will call us and say, ‘Well, I don't understand why I was denied this benefit.’ And we explain, ‘Well, we didn't even apply for that benefit.’...it throws people off because it says, ‘We denied your application for Transportation.’ They didn't apply for it to start with.  - P4_

Some VSOs had specific feedback regarding the paper form and award letter. One VSO (P4) mentioned that on page three of the form, the FDC instructions mention medical examination — **_“this statement should be deleted. This is a benefit for a deceased Veteran! The claimant doesn't need a medical examination.”_** [See appendix](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/burials-memorials/burial-allowance/research/2024-09-VSO-Research/research-findings.md#fdc-program-language-page-3). Another VSO mentioned adding an “unknown” checkbox option. For instance, include an “unknown” checkbox for the military section. **_“Just put a box that says unknown. That way, you don't think they skipped or missed it. They generally don't know, and I don't think that's unreasonable.”_** Another VSO suggested increasing the font size of the paper form and moving all the instructions to the end of the form, like some of the other paper forms he has come across.  

#### Recommendation: 
- Ensure the award letter is straightforward and doesn’t mention “denied” when the claimant has not applied for that benefit.


#### Findings 6
Some claimants are unaware of VA and Burial Benefits, resulting in some missing out on years of benefits they are entitled to.

Several people don’t know about VA benefits and go years without knowing they could have been eligible for some benefits. This is a regrettable missed opportunity. For these particular cases, one VSO (P6) mentioned that they make sure they apply for all the benefits the claimants might have missed, ensuring they are not overpaid. 

> _“It's all about misinformation. It's it's really there's a lot of misinformation around the burial benefits that are entitled to veterans, right? And that could be for whatever reason.” - P3_

> _“They file for survivors' benefits but have no clue about burial benefits. And it could be. I've had claimants come in several years later, and we're like, did you ever file for burial? And they're like, no, I didn't know I could. Like, oh, and then we have to go through, and we have to try and get the paperwork together and file because they didn't know they were able to file for it.” - P5_

> _“They don't know anything. Some have no idea that when their husband died x amounts of years ago, they would've been entitled to this because he died of a service-connected condition.” P6_

> _“They may have only gotten a nonservice-connected burial 10 years ago. Well, now that they died of prostate cancer and they have established their Agent Orange, they're entitled to the $2000 because the rule has changed. So it's nice for me to go looking back. OK, so instead of me saying you'll get the $2000. You already got $300 back in 1996. So you're only going to get the difference now.” - P6_


#### Finding 7
Additional VSO recommendations around the Burial Benefits

Other VSO Recommendations include contacting claimants to confirm VA support during difficult times, mailing information packets after a Veteran's passing, automatically sending families their presidential letter, and granting VSOs access to VA.gov

> _“Then it may be a phone call. Hey, we want to make sure that you understand some of the information that'll be sent out. We do know it's an overwhelming time.”  - P7_ 

> _“Someone might just call the VA and say my husband was a veteran, he passed away and that that kind of automatically send that package to the VA.” - P6_

> _“ Once the VA is notified that the Veteran has passed, just send the presidential letter to the family instead of having them apply for it” - P3_
“I look forward to hopefully seeing a backdoor version of this claims process for VSO soon. I know it's been in the conversation for quite some time now.” - P5

## Recommendations

### Navigating Veteran End-of-Life, Death, Burial, and the Claimants' Experience  
1.	HMW put less burden to claimants during the Burial Benefits application process 
2.	Consider automating and auto-populating as much information we can about the deceased Veteran
3.	Ensure that we are preparing Veterans and their families for the death of the Veteran 
4.	HMW leverage ways VSOs prepare Veteran and their families in our digital space
5.	Clearly outline the expected time frames for obtaining supporting documents. 
6.	Review the checklist one of the VSO participants shared that's used to ensure claimants know what supporting documents. HMW provide this service digitally? [(see folder “Documents received from VSOs”)](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/vaabdvro/Shared_Documents/Pension/Burial/VSO_Research/Documents_received_from-VSOs?csf=1&web=1&e=gMfrBu)
7.	Identify if the claimant or the deceased Veteran is already receiving VA benefits. We might not need military information for these claimants since the VA has already verified their military history. 
8.	Ensure claimants have included all the necessary information and supporting documents before they submit the form.  

### Comprehension of Burial Benefits and Eligibility    
9.	Set the expectation that the VA will not cover all expenses but only a small portion. 
10.	Incorporate additional information about how much reimbursement a claimant can get when they apply for Burial Benefits. 
11.	Include the maximum and minimum amounts someone might get depending on their eligibility in the paper form.
12.	Change “allowance” to “reimbursement” so claimants understand that receipts are needed to claim Burial Benefits and further explain that the person incurring the expenses should be the person claiming the benefit.
13.	Explain each type of allowance, specifically transportation allowances, and various scenarios where transportation expenses could be reimbursed
14.	Consider using plain language throughout the form.
15.	Provide more explanations regarding these terms online and on the paper form: service-connected, not service-connected, file number, and place of interment.
16.	Research the connection between DIC and Burial Benefits. There’s an opportunity to bring awareness to the DIC in the Burial Benefits paper form and online form and vice versa. There’s also an opportunity to streamline the process, where we can guide a surviving spouse to apply for DIC first if the Veteran passes away from service-connected implications.

### Secondary findings  
17.	Mention the importance of including when the Veteran passed away from a service-connected implication in their death certificate.
18.	Ensure the Burial Benefits form is available in multiple languages, both paper and online. More research should be done to identify which languages.
19.	Include bank information on the paper and online forms so claimants can get reimbursement faster.
20.	Clearly outline the expected time frames for receiving Burial Benefits reimbursement
21.	Ensure the award letter is straightforward and doesn’t mention “denied” when the claimant has not applied for that benefit.



## Next Steps

- Present VSO Burial research findings and recommendations with the Pension Burial team
- Pension Burial team can share this report and deck with VBA partners
- Incorporate findings into the following Burial Benefits enhancement
- Quick wins that the Pension Burial team can focus on:
    - Include bank information on the paper and online forms so claimants can get reimbursement faster. Since Pensions already include this information on both paper and online forms, VBA might be more open to incorporating it into the Burial Benefits form, both on paper and online.
    - Explain each type of allowance, specifically transportation allowances, and various scenarios where transportation expenses could be reimbursed.
    - Consider using plain language throughout the form.
    - Provide more explanations regarding these terms online and on the paper form: service-connected, not service-connected, file number, and place of interment.
    - Clearly outline the expected time frames for obtaining supporting documents and receiving Burial Benefits reimbursement.
    - Include the maximum and minimum amounts someone might get depending on their eligibility in the paper form.
- To verify these findings, conduct additional research with spouses, children, extended family, friends, caregivers, funeral homes, state cemeteries, and executors.
- Research the connection between DIC and Burial Benefits. There’s an opportunity to bring awareness to the DIC in the Burial Benefits paper form and online form and vice versa. There’s also an opportunity to streamline the process, where we can guide a surviving spouse to apply for DIC first if the Veteran passes away from service-connected implications.


## Further research needed

#### Claimants might incur additional fees to obtain supporting documentation.
In addition to all the funeral, burial, and plot expenses, some VSOs mentioned that claimants might need to pay extra fees to obtain certain supporting documents. One VSO (P4) in Minnesota mentioned that they don’t charge claimants for obtaining supporting documents. Still, if the claimant lived in another state, claimants must track down these supporting documents from out-of-state and pay $25 to get them.

> _“In Minnesota, we don't pay for any documents. We have laws that allow us to obtain those for free. If I call to Kentucky looking for a death certificate, they might want to charge me 25 bucks. [this fee falls on the claimant]” - P4_

#### Some claimants might face name change challenges.
One VSO mentioned a case where a claimant’s maiden last name was on VA, so when the check came, it came in with the wrong last name. In this particular case, the spouse was added to VA benefits using the wrong last name, and the information was never updated. The spouse realized their last name was incorrect when the Burial Benefit check arrived.

> _“If the dependency was previously established for the surviving spouse with the incorrect last name and the surviving spouse didn’t change her maiden last name to the married last name. We've had a couple of times where the burial allowance check went out with the married name. So they couldn't cash the check because it wasn't actually their name. So we've had to fight to get the check reissued using the correct name.” - P1_

#### Some VSOs mentioned that some claimants can face challenges if the Veteran never taps into VA benefits.
> _“You're not even eligible because the Veteran never filed anything with the VA, so yeah… I mean, that happened to both my grandfathers. Neither one filed a claim, so when their times came, they got headstone. Well, one got a heads stone. One got a marker. There were no burial benefits. I didn't know it from my first grandfather. I was a child, but my last grandfather passed in 2020, and I didn't get his pension claim in time. So we're kind of SOL.” - P6_

> _“They never tapped into VA, meaning they never came into our offices. They never filed a claim… And they heard this was, what I get when I die. They're going to give me a plot of land and reimburse you for a funeral.” - P3_

#### Some VSOs mentioned funeral homes are proactive in helping claimants complete the Burial benefits form. In contrast, others could take advantage of claimants unfamiliar with it.

> _“Their surviving spouse will say, ‘We're working with the funeral director. They're helping us complete the form because they'll have all the information.’ So, a lot of times you're seeing that the 530 are being completed upfront by the funeral directors helping the families.” - P7”

> _“ I think some of that might be some unsavory tactics to get them to spend more money on a funeral, and all of a sudden, you say, ‘Nope, you're only going to get this much.’ But they spent so much more with the funeral, and then you gotta explain. It's not even a part of that. The funeral expenses aren't what can be reimbursed.” - P6_

#### Claimants might get confused about tribal contributions about question 19A, and others might have issues with supplemental claims. 
One VSO (P1) mentioned getting a lot of questions regarding tribal contributions. Question 19A asks, “Did the federal/state government or the Veteran’s employer contribute to the burial?.” It doesn’t mention tribal contributions. Native Americans, who might choose “Yes, tribal trust land” for question 18, might also receive tribal contributions and might want to report them on the Burial Benefits form.  

> _“The questions I'm getting about the form when they're filling it out is if a federal or state government like or like veterans employer contributed to the burial. The most recent question I got about it was about tribal contributions. Technically, they're not federal, and they're not state. They're a sovereign nation… So, I looked through the M21 rules. I asked the pension management center. Hey, you know what? What is the correct answer here? And yeah, the answer was ‘no.’ You don't put anything there.” - P1_

Another VSO (P5) mentioned that he’s had some claimants who have gotten the Burial Benefits denied and have submitted a new Burial Benefits form without submitting a supplemental form. The VA will then reject this new Burial Benefits claim and it would delay the claimant from receiving the Burial Benefits.  

> _“[When there's a denial]  people don't realize that they still have to submit the supplemental claim form when they're reopening that denial, and so when they'll go, they'll refile, and they'll submit just the 530 with all the evidence that they need to prove that they're entitled to the benefit. But they don't do the supplemental claims, so the VA has to reject that claim, which automatically is now going to delay things at least a month or two” - P5_
