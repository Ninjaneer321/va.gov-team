## Background
VA Form 21P-530 (Application for Burial Benefits) enables eligible individuals to apply for compensation to help cover burial, funeral, and transportation costs. We know “often the first time a Veteran’s family interacts directly with VA is during a high-emotional time of a Veteran’s death.”

Our team aimed to better understand the claimants’ mental models regarding the Burial Benefits form, primarily through the insights of Veterans Service Officers (VSOs), County Veterans Service Officers (CVSOs), and National Service Officers (NSOs). We aimed to identify which sections of the form need clarification and what factors create obstacles, such as drop-offs and delays in the application process.   

## Research Goals
Our goals for this study are the following:

- Understand how VSOs support claimants through the application and post-submission process
- Understand VSOs’ experiences working with claimants and the claimant’s experience by proxy
- Understand what impedes claimants from continuing the Burial benefits form


## Research Questions
- Understand how VSOs support claimants
   - **What brings claimants to seek VSO support?**
   - **What areas of the application VSOs may need to clarify?**
   - What tools do they use to help claimants apply for Burial benefits?
   - What are the typical causes for issuing development letters when working on the Burial Benefits application?
- Understand VSOs’ experiences working with claimants and the claimant’s experience by proxy.
   - Understand the claimant by proxy: Is it typically family members, friends, caretakers, etc.? What are the claimant’s environment, factors, behaviors, and feelings about the Burial benefits from by proxy through VSOs?
   - **What is the VSOs’ mental model of Burial, the Burial application,  Burial service, behaviors, and sentiments?**
   - How do they verify that the claimant is a relative, friend, etc., of the deceased Veteran?
- Understand what impedes claimants from continuing the Burial benefits form
   - **What may stop someone from applying for the burial benefits form online or on paper?**
   - Why do claimants not complete and successfully submit the Burial benefits form?
   - **What sections of the application do claimants need more assistance with?**
   - **What information is most critical?**
   - Why might an application be delayed or denied?


## Methodology 

We conducted semi-structured interviews with six VSOs who assisted claimants in completing the Burial Benefits form. Three of the six VSOs had previously participated in the VSO Pension research.

This research was part of the VSO pilot led by Lesly Ropp and Dené Gabaldón. We followed the research guidelines provided by the VSO pilot team. Participants were selected from the existing volunteered-based VSO pilot database. Our team sent recruitment emails and utilized Microsoft Bookings to enable participants to schedule interview sessions with us using Microsoft Teams.


### Participants
We aimed to gather insights from Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), County Veterans Service Officers (CVSOs), and National Service Officers (NSOs) across various states, including both rural, urban, and suburban areas. Additionally, we sought input from regional offices, Veteran service organizations, Veteran charity organizations, and other accredited entities. It was crucial for our research to interview VSOs from this diverse array of groups to ensure our findings are generalizable and applicable to a wide range of claimants. This approach has helped us prevent bias from focusing on a single group and allowed us to capture different perspectives based on geography and VSO accreditation.

We interviewed a total of six participants across 5 different states: California, Missouri, Minnesota, Nevada and Pennsylvania (2)

- 1 VSO
- 2 CVSOs
- 2 SVSOs
- 2 NSOs 
- 3 from rural areas
- 3 from urban/suburban areas
- 4 worked in regional offices
   - North Dakota Department of Veteran Affairs (NDDVA)
   - California Association of County Veteran Service Officers (CACVSO)
   - Minnesota Brown County VSO
   - Nevada Department of Veteran Services
- 2 worked in Veteran charity organizations
   - Wounded Warrior
   - Disabled American Veterans (DAV) 

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

The study could show that claimants who receive support from VSOs have an easier time completing the Burial Benefits form and gathering all the supporting evidence, leading to less application processing time.

Mostly true. While VSOs support claimants by preparing them for the Burial Benefits, obtaining as much supporting evidence on their behalf, reducing the application process, and giving claimants a lower risk for obtaining development letters, VSOs still need to wait on some information and supporting evidence from the claimant, such as the receipt of all the expenses.
