# Product Outline: Form 21-8416 Medical Expense Report

---

## Overview
Veterans, their spouses/family members, and other third parties use Form 8416 to submit expenses for in-home attendants, full-time care facilities, adult daycare, other various medical costs, and mileage for travel to support care. Claimants report these expenses to help VA better calculate their income and assets compared to their outlaid care costs, potentially increasing their eligibility for and payment rate of benefits. These expenses are often reported on a yearly basis.

## Problem Statement
Veterans and their families have to report their medical expenses each year to confirm their eligibility for VA benefits. The existing form is time-consuming to fill out, cramped in layout, and requires additional forms that require care providers' signatures. This form should be digitized to streamline the claimant experience of submitting it, which could in turn accelerate VA’s ability to make decisions based on the submitted data.

## Desired User Outcomes

- Users will know at the start of the process which forms they need signed by a third-party and uploaded as an attachment to their claim.
- Users will have the ability to fill out as many line items as necessary for each form section, unhindered by the paper form’s space limitations
- Users will have a shorter total-time-to-complete for the web form v. the paper/PDF form

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Form now takes longer to fill out

- User lacks clarity on what documents they need to upload with the form


## Desired Business Outcomes

- VA will receive these forms more accurately and quickly from users, enabling faster decision-making on claimants' cases
- [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) will have increased exposure to users as an option for filling out forms and filing claims with ease

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- VA does not use the web form’s data to support decision-making

- VA’s timeliness stays the same or decreases when using these forms for decision-making

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use                                               | Service completion                                           | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------ |
| KPI      | Number of 8416 submissions via web form per month (quant) | Rate of 8416 submissions via web form that are able to be used in  decision-making without additional development by claim examiner (qual) |                    |        |
| KPI      |                                                           |                                                              |                    |        |

## Assumptions
