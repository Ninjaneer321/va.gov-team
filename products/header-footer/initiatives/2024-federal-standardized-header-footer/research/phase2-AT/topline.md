This topline summary is a preliminary summary of research findings observed in the research sessions. The purpose is to share what was learned in the sessions before the full research report is complete.

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on **wayfinding using the new Federal header and footer**, as well as Veteran sentiment on the new USA logo branding, **from Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier assistive technology**. 

## Participants
On January 29 - February 5, 2024, we talked over Zoom with **9 Veterans**--2 of which were also family members of Veterans. 
- One third (3 of 9) saw the **mobile** version of the prototype
- Two thirds (6 of 9) saw the **desktop** version of the prototype 


## Preliminary Findings
### Usability Successes
1. The **page design was well received overall**. Participants  mentioned specifically liking the page layout, the links in the header and footer, the placement of the *Sign in* button in the top right, the simple font with good color contrast, the menus that start out collapsed, and the ample spacing between touchable links on mobile devices. 
1. **Successful wayfinding to tasks seemed *not* adversely affected by the new header and footer**. Each participant completed 5-7 wayfinding tasks. 3 of 9 participants completed all of their tasks without any help, while others were challenged by a few of them. Tasks that were most difficult were FOIA information (for participants not looking in the federal footer area) and changing address (for participants who had trouble finding the Auth menu).
1. **None of the 9 participants mentioned missing the "VA" logo**, so it seems fine to not have that on the page. Everyone noticed the VA seal and the text "U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs", which was sufficient to participants to recognize the site as pertaining to the VA.
1. After opening the Auth menu, **all participants recognized and clicked on *Profile***, which was the correct navigation path. 

### Authentication issues
1. After signing in using the prototype, **one third of the participants (3 of 9, which was 2 on mobile and 1 on desktop) didn't recognize that they were actually signed in** because the user interface didn't change much. The subtle change of the "Sign in" button to "Sign out" (on mobile) or their first name (on desktop) wasn't enough for everyone to notice.
1. After signing in, ***ALL 3 of the mobile users* had difficulty finding the Auth menu**, which was located *under their name within the mobile header menu*. They didn't think to click on the *Menu* button because they were looking for their name or something like "My profile" at the top of the screen.
1. After signing in, ***2 of 6 desktop users* had difficulty finding the Auth menu** (by clicking on their name), while the other 4 found it easily. One participant's difficulty was because he didn't notice the triangle dropdown indicator to the right of his name (he was using a screen magnifier, and the shape was different from the carat symbol for dropdowns in the blue menu bar). The other participant's difficulty was due to confusion about what her screen reader said ("button menu"), and she wondered whether it was a button or a menu.


### Footer issues
1. **Four participants (3 desktop, 1 mobile) misperceived the bottom of the page and didn't see any of the links in the black federal footer** until prompted by the moderator to scroll farther down. 3 of them stopped scrolling at the blue VA footer, and 1 stopped at the white USA logo. One person in phase 1 also stopped scrolling at the white USA logo, so that's a total of 2 participants from both phases of research.
1. **Three participants interpreted the footer as only the black federal part**, and so when they were looking for links that they thought would be in the footer *(Careers, Contact us)*, they **looked only there and not in the blue VA part** of the footer. They interpreted the blue VA part of the footer as part of the page content, not part of the footer where they should be looking.
1. **Three participants looked for *Find a VA Location* in the blue VA footer**, which is not there in the prototype (but *is* there in Production). Two participants instead selected the *State Veterans Affairs Offices* link that enables you to pick a state and then go to that state's VA link (unmodernized page), which doesn't go to the Facility Locator. The third participant looked in 3 different columns of the blue footer before looking in the header instead. (*Note*: Research participants heard ALL user task prompts while they were at the top of one of the pages in the prototype, so the header and page content were visible but the footer was not.)
1. **Two participants said that the blue VA part is too large** and has too many links. One person in phase 1 said the same thing, so that's a total of **3 people from both phases of research.**

### Header issues
1. 

### Accessibility issues to investigate 
#### Issues that caused difficulty during sessions


1. p3 (desktop using MAGic 14 screen reader and magnifier) **didn't notice the 4th column of footer links** with his magnified screen. When we looked at it together later, he said that there's a larger gap after column 3 than there is between the other columns, so he assumed that there was nothing more to the right.
1. p10 (desktop using VoiceOver screen reader on an iPad) was **confused by navigation in the blue footer because he didn't perceive any columns but saw (with limited vision) the screen jump**, which happened every time he moved from the last link in one column to the first link in an adjacent column.
   > *"I'm down here at the lower part of screen. Now I'm back at the top of the screen, and...I think I did something wrong or something's going funky with the screen" (p10).*
1. p7 (mobile using VoiceOver screen reader on an iPhone) was **confused by the header buttons changing name**: search magnifying glass changed to *X*, and *Menu* changed to *Close*.
   > *"It isn't quite self-evident. You just kind of got to remember that. That's where the search icon used to be, and it is now replaced with just an X" (p7).*
1. p1 (desktop using JAWS screen reader) was confused about why the **screen reader said "button menu" for her name** (to open the Auth menu). She wondered if it's a button or a menu because they're two different things that you interact with different? they're too diff things. never encountered this before.
1. p1 (desktop using JAWS screen reader) **didn't hear "link" at the beginning of the FOIA link and so thought it wasn't clickable**. When the moderator asked her to go back and listen again, she heard "link" this time.
1. p10 (desktop using VoiceOver screen reader on an iPad) tried to click on the *Contact Us* column header in the blue footer. They **couldn't tell that it wasn't interactive** from what the screen reader said. This same participant also tried clicking on the *Get education benefits* header text on the *VA Benefits and Health Care > Education and training* page.

#### Issues discussed but didn't cause much difficulty during sessions
1. p7 (mobile using VoiceOver screen reader on an iPhone) said that it's **difficult to differentiate a menu from the content behind** when the menu background is the same color as what it's overlaying. In this way, The it's hard for the participant to tell where the menu ends and the content continues. Note that our prototype pushes the content down, rather than covering any of it up, but not sure how this will work in the implementation. 

1. p6 (desktop using ZoomText screen magnifier) said that the **VA Benefits and Health Care menu options aren't visible with her screen magnification**, but she knows to scroll horizontally to find the options because the arrows tell you which direction to look (to the right).

1. p11 (desktop with the font enlarged ~150%) said that they **preferred a larger font**, which they suggested doing by having less white space on the left and right sides of the content. 

### Content feedback to consider
1. See **Footer issue #3** above.
1. See **Footer issue #4** above.
1. Two participants **didn't know what the "Business" link was** in the blue footer was. One wondered why they would need that and the "Researchers" link. The other participant thought the "Business" link might be for classes on having your own business.  
1. One participant said that the **"Privacy, policies, and legal information" and "Privacy Service" links seem redundant**. They wondered if they could be combined into one link.
1. One participant said that **"About VA" doesn't make sense in the black part** of the footer unless the VA link would be there for all federal agencies. All the other VA information is in the blue part of the footer.
1. One participant **wanted to see information specifically for seniors** or geriatrics since there are already so many other links for other kinds of Veterans. He would like to see information on activities for seniors (e.g., day programs, the Senior Olympics) and medical links (e.g., how to get tested for Alzheimers). He said *"I feel discriminated against" (p9).*
1. One participant **wanted the "Information for" footer accordion to be more descriptive**. She said that the items underneath were a mixture of individual identies, medical diagnoses, group events, and unknown information for "Business" and "Researchers".  
1. One participant noticed that the **mobile header close buttons are inconsistent**: *X* to close the search panel *vs.* *Close* for the Menu.
     > *"There's no standardization between the two...If I'm looking for an X, it should have the same function across the website" (p7).*



### How recognize as an official government website
1. Most (TBD of 9) participants said that they would **look at the URL to see if it's *.gov* or *VA.gov*** because the words and graphics could be spoofed. 
1. Participants also mentioned other features of the page:
     - **VA seal** (TBD)
     - "An official website of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs" in the footer (TBD)
     - "U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs" in the header (TBD)
     - "USA Government" in header (TBD)
     - Logo, typeface, and accordions of other VA pages (TBD) 
     - "USA" logo in footer (TBD)
     - "Veterans Crisis Line" (TBD)

### Feedback on the USA Logos
1. **TBD of 9 participants thought the colored USA logo in the header was TBD** with varying degrees of sentiment: 
 


18. **TBD participants liked the black/white USA logo in the footer better than the colored one** in the header because it stands out, looks good, and seems more official.
