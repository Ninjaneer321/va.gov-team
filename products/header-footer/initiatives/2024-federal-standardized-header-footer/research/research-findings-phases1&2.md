## Research Goals
OFCIO and GSA (USWDS) proposed a federal header and footer in an effort to standardize across all federal agencies, and it included a new “USA” logomark. The Department of Veterans Affairs volunteered to be the first high-impact service provider (HISP) to attempt to adopt this proposed header and footer and integrate them into the department’s design system.

Initial usability research tested with Veterans to validate that it can be  adopted with minimal to no negative impact to site visitors.

There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and the header and footer throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out 
- Starting up 
- Taking care of myself 
- Retiring 
- Aging 

The purpose of this research was to find out:
- Wayfinding task success rate throughout header and footer menus
- How Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology navigate the proposed header and footer IA
- Veteran sentiment on USA logo and VA seal, with the dropping of the “VA” brand mark

## Research Questions



## Methodology 
We conducted **remote usability testing** over Zoom on October 2-6, 2023 to get feedback from research participants using a prototype that presented the questions 

Perigean recruited the participants. **We talked to 9 Veterans**, two of whom were also Veterans' family members.

- **Most (8 of 9) used a computer** e.
