## Research Goals
OFCIO and GSA (USWDS) proposed a federal header and footer in an effort to standardize across all federal agencies, and it included a new “USA” logomark. The Department of Veterans Affairs volunteered to be the first high-impact service provider (HISP) to attempt to adopt this proposed header and footer and integrate them into the department’s design system.

Initial usability research tested with Veterans to validate that it can be  adopted with minimal to no negative impact to site visitors.

There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and the header and footer throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out 
- Starting up 
- Taking care of myself 
- Retiring 
- Aging 

The purpose of this research was to find out:
- **Wayfinding task success rate** using the proposed Federal header and footer menus
- **How Veterans using screen reader or screen magnifier technology navigate** the proposed header and footer IA
- **Veteran sentiment on USA logo and VA seal**, with the dropping of the “VA” brand mark

The findings from this research show how the proposed header and footer design impacts the Veteran wayfinding experience. 

## Research Questions
1. Are Veterans (and others) able to navigate the newly organized footer with new column headings, link names, and separate VA and Federal footer sections? 
    - What tasks, if any, do participants struggle navigating to?  
1. How does the new font family and increased font size impact readability?  
1. Do Veterans (and others) using screen readers or other assistive technology have a positive experience with information wayfinding and task completion?  
1. What do Veterans (and others) think of the integration of both the authenticated menu and main menu on mobile into one menu? 
    - Do they provide a better, positive experience or create confusion? (i.e., how to sign in, sign out, locate  auth menu items) 
1. What are Veterans’ (and others’) task success rates?  
1. What are Veterans’ (and others’) first impressions of the new header and footer? 
    - How do Veterans (and others) feel about the way VA is represented in the header without the letters “VA”?  
    - How do Veterans (and others) feel about the new USA logo? 


## Methodology

We conducted **remote usability testing** over Zoom in 3 research phases to get feedback from participants using a design prototype showing VA.gov:

Research Phase | Participants | Tasks | Dates | Topline Summary
----- |------|-------|--------|--------
1 | 10 non-assistive technology users | Unauthenticated + authenticated | Dec 15-21, 2023 | [link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2024-federal-standardized-header-footer/research/phase1-no-AT/topline.md)
2 | 9 assistive technology (screen reader and/or screen magnifier) users | Unauthenticated + authenticated | Jan 29-Feb 5, 2024 | [link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/header-footer/initiatives/2024-federal-standardized-header-footer/research/phase2-AT/topline.md)
3 | 4 assistive + 8 non-assistive technology users | Authenticated only | Jan 29-Feb 1, 2024 | [link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/discovery-research/authenticated-menu-usability/summary.md)

This report will cover Phases 1-2 in detail. Phase 3 is covered in the third topline summary link above.

## Participants
 Perigean recruited all of the participants. In Phases 1-2, **we talked to 19 people**.

- **Most** (18 of 19) **were Veterans**, 4 were family members of Veterans, 2 were caregivers of Veterans, and 1 was a Service Member (some had multiple roles).
- **Almost half** (8 of 19) **saw a mobile prototype**, and the others (11 of 19) saw a desktop prototype. 
- **About half** (9 of 19) **were full-time assistive technology users**: 5 used a screen reader, and 5 used a screen magnifier (one person used both).

The assistive technology used by 9 participants is summarized in the table below. All of them had been using their assistive tech for at least 2 years (average of 10 years; range 2-18 years).

P# | Screen Reader/ Magnifier | Software | Device | O/S | Browser | Prototype version
-- | ----- |------|-------|--------|--------|---------
1 | SR | JAWS | computer | Windows | Chrome | desktop
2 | SR | Fusion | computer | Windows | Chrome | mobile (b/c browser window small)
3 | SR & SM | MAGic | computer | Windows | Firefox | desktop
4 | SM | Magnified screen by 160% | phone | iOS | Chrome | mobile
6 | SM | ZoomText | computer | Windows | Edge | desktop
7 | SR | VoiceOver | phone | iOS | Safari | mobile
9 | SM | Increased font to 125% | tablet | iOS | Safari | desktop
10 | SR | VoiceOver | tablet | iOS | Safari | desktop
11 | SM | Increased font to 150% | computer | Windows | Chrome | desktop

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Veterans (and others) will be able to easily use the header and footer. 
1. Veterans (and others) won’t have any difficulty reading any of the text shown in the prototypes. 
1. Veterans (and others) who use assistive technology (screen reader or screen magnification software) will be able to easily use the header and footer. 
1. The new VA seal helps Veterans (and others) understand this is a VA website. 
1. Veterans (and others) will be able to easily find the authenticated menu when it’s integrated with the main menu in the mobile header. 
1. The new USA logo mark helps Veterans (and others) understand this is a Federal government website. 

1. 
    - MOSTLY TRUE: 
     


## Key Findings

1. **Wayfinding wasn't adversely affected** by the header and footer design.
1. There were some **accessibility problems that affected task completion by participants using screen readers**.
1. **Half of the participants had difficulty finding the Auth menu**, and a third of the participants didn't recognize that they were signed in.
1. There was **confusion about what constituted the footer and the bottom of the page**, due to a long VA footer followed by a shorter federal footer.
1. **More than half of the participants who could see the colored federal USA logo in the header had negative impressions** of it. Some of these participants preferred the white USA logo in the footer.
1. **None of the participants mentioned missing the "VA" logo**. Everyone noticed the VA seal and the text "U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs", which was sufficient to recognize the site as pertaining to the VA.


## Details of Findings 



### 1. 
For each of the 7 tasks that research participants did during the sessions, the moderator recorded how it was completed:
- **Directly successful** (using one of the "correct" paths implemented in the prototype)
- **Indirectly successful** (using a different path that wasn't implemented in the prototype but was plausible and would likely work in Production, such as doing a site search, OR using one of the "correct" paths in the prototype but not as the first try)
- **Needed help** (needed a hint or other help from the moderator in order to successfully complete the task)
- **Unsuccessful** (unable to complete the task, even with help from the moderator)

The success rate for each task was computed by adding together the directly and indirectly successful numbers and dividing by the number of participants who completed that task. A summary of the data is shown in the table below. **All 7 tasks were completed successfully without any help by at least 60% of the participants**. The 3 tasks with the lowest success rates (60-75%) were challenging for some participants because they didn't look in the footer (for the FOIA and VA Careers links) or couldn't find the Auth menu (needed to update mailing address).
