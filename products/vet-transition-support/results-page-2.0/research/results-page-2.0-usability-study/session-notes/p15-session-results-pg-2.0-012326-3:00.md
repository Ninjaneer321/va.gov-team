| Location | GA / Rural |
| Separation | More than 10 years |
| Guard and reserve | N/A |
| Honorable discharge | Yes |
| Years served | 1-4 years |
| Cognitive disability | Yes |
| Assistive tech | Screen magnifying |
| Comfort with technology | Somewhat |
| About device and accessibility tech | using windows laptop (HP, with copilot) with built in screen magnifier program. Wants to learn to use copilot to help her--but just got it, so isn't comfortable yet. Using magnifier for a little over a year, but finds the screen reaeder frustrating since it reads everything aloud ("too much for my nerves". Prefers just regular magnification. Used to use screen reader on her iphone Laptop comfortability (just magnification, no screen reading): very comfortable |
| What services they use on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) | uses secure messages for lab test results, also uses it to refill RXs and get medications. Recently went to VA hospital and learned about things on VA.gov to help learn about health information (other benefits she could apply for and submitting claims) Lately logging in almost every other day ("A lot going on in my life right now.") |
| Complete questionnaire easily | Yes |
| Questionnaire observations | first impulse was to sign in reads through the info before going to get started when she sees multiple things on a page, she always goes through the whole page and reads everything before going on Finds the review accordion redundant--but realized that her zoom window was blocking the fact that it was a review and not asking her to review her choices. Wasn't clear that it was a review page--thought she was going to go into more of a breakdown of the DYB tool was(?) She would normally read the policy (but there's an error in new tab when she clicks), having some trouble getting back to previous tab since it opened a new tab (she tried hitting back and refresh, but nothing happened) In this case, she'd exit the whole system (program) and then try to log in again. thoroughly reads the intro material and filter boxes before moving onto results |
| Finding sort | No |
| Notes on finding sort | said she noticed the results are alphabetical (but I think she might've been looking at filters?) Not sure what "expiration date (soonest first)" as a sort means and asked Anna about it. |
| Use sort as expected? | No |
| Notes on using sort | Asks why disability comp shows up first, while scrolling through, she says that it's ordered by what people most need as the transition out (i.e. order of importantance) thinks Disability Comp is first for her because she's a disabled Vet. "expiration date (soonest first)" sounds like it would be about priorizing things that are most impactful, important to her. Switches back and forth between expiration and alhpa order to see what differences there are. |
| Finding filters | Yes |
| Notes on finding filters | saw them immediately and starts clicking before going to full list of results Doesn't know why before AND after are shown for transitioning service members. Thinks it should just be AFTER. the "Benefits for transitioning service members" link made her think that it would ONLY be for transition service members. The link for service members link to info for VA benefits for service members is confusing to her. She clicked and doesn't see how it connects to her experience//benefits she's eligible for. Thinks that the "show only results for you" doesn't need to exist, since that should be the only things that get shown.  |
| Use filters as expected? | Yes |
| Notes on using filters | She clicked them very quickly (After separation, since that's what she is; more support since that's what she's interested in). Seems like she's using the filters more as radio buttons instead of checkboxes (unchecking one as she checks another), but that might just be because she feels like she knows enough about health care Said she expected to see more results after selecting "more support" from the filter. Seems to prefer using the informational links at the top of the page more than the filters for her actual recommendations. But feels like these have a lot of information to take in ("It just feels like a lot") |
| Exploring and understanding recommended vs all | Yes with help |
| Notes on recommended vs all | Anna prompted her to click the filter, I think.  |
| Exploring and understanding when to apply filter | Yes |
| Notes on when to apply filter | Used it imediately to narrow things down to her experiences. Later used it to show everything. |
| Found benefit information easily | Yes |
| Notes on finding benefit information | Found links for in about transitioning and current service confusing (not sure how it relates to her situation, or the situation of someone transitioning) Hadn't seen info about mental health before and said that the SGLI \--\> VGLI info would've been really helpful when she was transitioning. Never heard of VR\&E before. She's clicking through links as she finds things she didn't know about before. Clicked through to VR\&E since she never heard of it, then clicked through to eligibility info on their va.gov page and would continue to read about that eligibility process. Thinks something like "Recreation activities" could be useful (e.g. fishing licenses), and then described why she thinks state benefits would be a great inclusion (she hasn't scrolled to the actual results yet). After seeing state benefits card, said she'd like more info in that card about the kinds of info that would be there (taxes, vehicles, recreation, etc.) to make it more simplistic for people. Doesn't know "where to go from here" after looking at the results card. Sees the "learn more" but wants to look at other benefits/information before going forward. Wants a help number to be more apparent in case you do have a problem. (make it easier to find) "There's a lot to take in all at once if you're trying to apply for benefits." Would like something more to the point with the information you need. (But is still talking about the informational links rather than the tailored benefit cards.) Interested in disability housing grant after seeing the card, so she clicked on it. Hadn't heard of this benefit before seeing it on the DYB results page Skips over "RECOMMENDED" since she's aware that these are already recommended for her based on filter. She's looking at the benefit titles and what are interesting to her, so big titles are helpful for her. |
| Is this tool helpful for you in your life today? | Yes |
| Notes on helpful in life today | Looking over all results (especially expiring/time sensitive ones for transitioning service members): this is something that would've been very helpful for me when I was transitioning (paraphrase) "Wow, well this is very important information. This makes a lot of sense." Hadn't heard of the SAH benefit before seeing it on the DYB results page, and she's going to research it outside of this. "I definitely think so", because she's finding out about things she's actually eligible for (SAH, GI Bill transfer) and knowing that it's there on a site for and she can find them. |
| Satisfaction 1-5 | 4-4.5 |
| Notes on satisfaction | 4-4.5 Putting in recreational--fun things--for Vets would make it better. Navigating isn't bad, but it feels overwhelming (a lot of info to go through before you get to what you really need) |
| What would you change about this tool to help someone transitioning from Active Duty? |  |
| What do you think VA should know about your experience getting benefits after transitioning? | She had issues with knowing about tri-care use and overlap during her transition period. Found that confusing. |
| Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared? |  |
| Recording consent | Yes |
| Consent to share clips | Yes |

00:00:15.730 \--\> 00:00:25.140  
Moderator: Great, and are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?  
4  
00:00:25.500 \--\> 00:00:27.040  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes, that's fine as well.  
5  
00:00:27.990 \--\> 00:00:41.379  
Moderator: Great. Okay, so, we briefly talked about this a couple minutes ago, but now that we're recording, I wanted to check in with you about it again. So, you said you're on an HP laptop.  
6  
00:00:41.380 \--\> 00:00:41.960  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes.  
7  
00:00:41.960 \--\> 00:00:45.500  
Moderator: You're using screen modif… you're using screen magnification.  
8  
00:00:45.770 \--\> 00:00:46.600  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes.  
9  
00:00:46.600 \--\> 00:00:59.399  
Moderator: and you're using the one that's built in with your computer, that, you're not using, like, an additional app or anything for it, and that you also are using, Copilot.  
10  
00:00:59.550 \--\> 00:01:03.709  
Moderator: to do some of your navigation. Can you tell… are you using that right now?  
11  
00:01:04.400 \--\> 00:01:22.189  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: The only thing I'm using right now is the screen magnifier. As I stated to you earlier, I just purchased this laptop. It came with Copilot. I, myself, and also, I'm trying to learn it as well. It's like an assistant, like an AI assistant. So, yeah, but I'm not familiar with it enough to tell you about it, because I'm learning myself.  
12  
00:01:24.090 \--\> 00:01:24.910  
Moderator: Gotcha.  
13

14  
00:01:32.630 \--\> 00:01:33.519  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: You're welcome.  
15  
00:01:39.960 \--\> 00:01:52.649  
Moderator: you know, so it sounds like you're new to magnification or, like, this laptop specifically. How long have you been using screen magnification in general?  
16  
00:01:53.270 \--\> 00:01:58.390  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I've been using it I want to say, like, a little bit over a year. Like, I don't…  
17  
00:01:58.540 \--\> 00:02:10.020  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: use it often, because I'm really not on my laptop often, like, on a laptop often, because it's really no need unless I have something to research, so I don't use it often, but it's been, like, a little bit over a year.  
18  
00:02:10.130 \--\> 00:02:12.909  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: It's just that it's kind of annoying, because  
19  
00:02:13.150 \--\> 00:02:16.730  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: It reads aloud everything, and it can't… it just…  
20  
00:02:17.390 \--\> 00:02:28.300  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: it's frustrating, you know what I mean, to use it, so I'd rather use the regular, just, screen magnifying to where it can just be… to where I can see it, you know? I like to 200 is enough for me to see it, but…  
21  
00:02:28.490 \--\> 00:02:31.410  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: It just is too much when it's talking and…  
22  
00:02:31.620 \--\> 00:02:34.289  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: all that for my nerves, like, it's just… I can't take it.  
23  
00:02:35.210 \--\> 00:02:49.159  
Moderator: When you were using the screen reader, do you know what it was called? Was it… was it JAWS or NVIDIADA, or were you using something that was inside… like, included with your computer?  
24  
00:02:50.420 \--\> 00:02:55.479  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'm not sure what it was called, because I didn't use it on my computer, I used it on my cell phone.  
25  
00:02:55.790 \--\> 00:02:57.080  
Moderator: Oh, got you.  
26  
00:02:57.080 \--\> 00:02:59.210  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: the cell phone that I was using it on.  
27  
00:02:59.520 \--\> 00:03:00.770  
Moderator: Do you have an iPhone?  
28  
00:03:01.120 \--\> 00:03:01.909  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I do.  
29  
00:03:01.910 \--\> 00:03:06.489  
Moderator: Okay, it's likely that you were using, Apple VoiceOver?  
30  
00:03:07.270 \--\> 00:03:08.689  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: That's exactly what it was.  
31  
00:03:08.690 \--\> 00:03:18.410  
Moderator: Okay, gotcha. Okay. So, like, just to recap, it sounds like, the magnification is working better for you because the voice was annoying.  
32  
00:03:18.700 \--\> 00:03:19.490  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes.  
33

35  
00:03:28.860 \--\> 00:03:32.620  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: the one I'm using now, the laptop, just regular screen magnifying.  
36  
00:03:33.000 \--\> 00:03:38.540  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I mean, if this is… it's… I can see, so I'm comfortable enough to put it in and be able to see, so…  
37  
00:03:39.120 \--\> 00:03:45.030  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: It's not much, you know, tech stuff to it, so I'm very comfortable with, you know, with that.  
38  
00:03:45.950 \--\> 00:03:57.630  
Moderator: Great. Okay, thanks. That's a lot of really useful context about, you know, what, you know, what we're gonna do for…  
39  
00:03:57.940 \--\> 00:04:01.930  
Moderator: the, for the research with this new tool. Okay.  
40  
00:04:02.270 \--\> 00:04:14.739  
Moderator: And a couple of questions about, you and, VA.gov, or VA Services. So, VA.gov, or the mobile app.  
41  
00:04:14.950 \--\> 00:04:22.279

42  
00:04:23.020 \--\> 00:04:32.890  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I go for the secure messages, I go for my lab test results, like, with everything I'm going through now, I go for everything, to refill my medication, my prescriptions, or what have you.  
43  
00:04:33.000 \--\> 00:04:36.370  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I mean, that's usually… and I don't really use my,  
44  
00:04:36.990 \--\> 00:04:40.290  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Lately, I went to the VA hospital.  
45  
00:04:40.960 \--\> 00:04:47.440  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: was talking to me about different things that was for, you know, advantageous for females to be aware of, because.  
46  
00:04:47.520 \--\> 00:04:50.239

P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I forgot what it's called, but it's on the Dropbox, you know, it has, like, MyHealthyVet and VA.com.  
49  
00:04:57.170 \--\> 00:05:00.299  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Gov, like, different things we can go to, but it's something,  
50  
00:05:00.570 \--\> 00:05:06.349  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: to learn, like, to help vets know more about, like, more information. So, I recently went to that as well.  
51  
00:05:06.790 \--\> 00:05:18.350  
Moderator: So, was it… was it suggesting information about… about healthcare or other benefits you might… you might want to apply for?  
52  
00:05:18.350 \--\> 00:05:26.999  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: other benefits that I might want to apply for. Like, I think it was the one that had claims and how to do this and all that. It fell underneath on that page.  
53  
00:05:27.000 \--\> 00:05:28.809  
Moderator: Okay, got it.  
54  
00:05:28.810 \--\> 00:05:29.490  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So…  
55  
00:05:30.440 \--\> 00:05:33.280  
Moderator: How often do you log in?  
56  
00:05:34.500 \--\> 00:05:40.670  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Ma'am, lately I've been logging in quite often, like, almost every other day, because there's a lot going on in my life right now, so yeah.  
57  
00:05:41.000 \--\> 00:05:42.630  
Moderator: Yeah, so, a lot.  
58  
00:05:42.660 \--\> 00:05:43.780  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes.  
59  
00:05:44.180 \--\> 00:05:54.239  
Moderator: Great, okay, so what I have for you is, this is a new thing that,  
60  
00:05:54.700 \--\> 00:06:04.599  
Moderator: is… it's on VA.gov. It is designed to help veterans understand, their benefits, and  
61  
00:06:04.930 \--\> 00:06:16.580  
Moderator: I have put a link in the chat for you, and if this isn't a good way to click on that link, just let me know, and we can figure out another way to get it to you, but  
62  
00:06:17.050 \--\> 00:06:21.440  
Moderator: Are you in Zoom, the app, or Zoom in your browser?  
63  
00:06:21.910 \--\> 00:06:28.710  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I am… my daughter downloaded This to my computer, so… It's the app she downloaded.  
64  
00:06:29.120 \--\> 00:06:46.619  
Moderator: That's great, it makes it a lot easier. Okay, so to get to the link, if you go to the bottom of Zoom, there's… there's some icons across the bottom, chat is right in the middle. If you click on that, and then click on the link in the chat.  
65  
00:06:50.530 \--\> 00:06:55.030  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, you're about to access a development port served by someone's Cold space.  
66  
00:06:55.210 \--\> 00:06:58.650  
Moderator: Yeah, and if you want to hit continue.  
67  
00:07:02.270 \--\> 00:07:10.259  
Moderator: And fortunately, that page isn't part of the actual website. That's, that's just part of the Perfect Five.  
68  
00:07:10.920 \--\> 00:07:11.840  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
69  
00:07:12.110 \--\> 00:07:16.310  
Moderator: Okay, so, now could you please share your browser with me?  
70  
00:07:17.110 \--\> 00:07:19.359  
Moderator: I'm sorry, share your screen with me.  
71  
00:07:21.250 \--\> 00:07:26.770  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I don't know how to… again, I don't normally use this, so I'm not sure how to share the screen with you.  
72  
00:07:26.910 \--\> 00:07:29.209  
Moderator: Oh, that's okay, I can talk you through it.  
73  
00:07:29.210 \--\> 00:07:30.749  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'm gonna minimize that.  
74  
00:07:30.750 \--\> 00:07:33.049  
Moderator: Yeah, so, what.  
75  
00:07:33.050 \--\> 00:07:34.030  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: They're here.  
76  
00:07:34.030 \--\> 00:07:37.380  
Moderator: What browser are you using to open that app, first of all?  
77  
00:07:37.800 \--\> 00:07:45.450  
Moderator: Or to open the, like… Are you using, Edge?  
78  
00:07:45.560 \--\> 00:07:47.280  
Moderator: Chrome…  
79  
00:07:48.270 \--\> 00:08:00.809  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'm not sure what this is. Like, literally, it looks like a CD disc, like a little green… I usually know it, but again, I'm not… I never used this one before. I usually use, like, Google and Chrome, but this is, like, a little…  
80  
00:08:02.130 \--\> 00:08:07.119  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: it looks like a little green… I'm not sure… I'm not sure what this is, what…  
81  
00:08:07.660 \--\> 00:08:12.300  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: And I'm not sure where it would tell me what it is. I don't know, ma'am.  
82  
00:08:12.810 \--\> 00:08:14.430  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I honestly do not know.  
83  
00:08:14.750 \--\> 00:08:22.580  
Moderator: We will figure it out. So the way to share your screen is go to the bottom of the Zoom window.  
84  
00:08:24.640 \--\> 00:08:33.560  
Moderator: And, right next to where you found chat, if you look over to the right, there's a share button. It has an arrow in it.  
85  
00:08:34.510 \--\> 00:08:35.860  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: All the way to the right.  
86  
00:08:36.000 \--\> 00:08:38.939  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I see share options, short…  
87  
00:08:39.150 \--\> 00:08:43.999  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Share sound optimized, but on the bottom, it's blue saying share, on the bottom of my screen.  
88

P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: And I thought I already clicked on that, so…  
177  
00:16:33.790 \--\> 00:16:38.229  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I would think it would bring me to something else, like a better breakdown.  
178  
00:16:38.760 \--\> 00:16:42.870  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Of understanding my benefits, what it should be, not bringing me back to the same question.

184  
00:17:08.550 \--\> 00:17:13.259  
Moderator: Correct me if I'm wrong, but are you scrolling, right and left?  
185  
00:17:15.599 \--\> 00:17:18.289  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: You said, am I scrolling bottom left?  
186  
00:17:18.290 \--\> 00:17:25.189

188  
00:17:30.960 \--\> 00:17:38.110  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: No, actually, it's the way the screen is set up, but the magnification with the… I don't have to, it's literally everything's on the screen.  
189  
00:17:38.240 \--\> 00:17:42.049  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: what was in the way was actually the Zoom. Like, can you still see me?  
190  
00:17:42.350 \--\> 00:17:59.420  
Moderator: Yes, you know, I'm not actually able to see the boxes from Zoom, but you are able, if there's something that says this meeting is being recorded, there's an X at the right end of that that you can click off.  
191  
00:18:00.150 \--\> 00:18:04.979  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, and that wasn't it? It's just saying that it was… it was just,  
192  
00:18:05.170 \--\> 00:18:16.929  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: in the weight, literally, it was too big, so I had to minimize it, but it's still there. Now I can actually see that I clicked on understand my benefits, and it's showing selected, so I can move down to service from this part.  
193  
00:18:17.150 \--\> 00:18:19.629  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Got it. So I'm clicking on service.  
194  
00:18:19.860 \--\> 00:18:26.530  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: And it's letting me know what I clicked on in total, how long have you serviced, letting me know 3 years or less, okay.  
195  
00:18:26.880 \--\> 00:18:33.529  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: the branch is telling me everything that I actually selected. I guess it's just kind of like a review before I proceed to the next step.  
196  
00:18:33.900 \--\> 00:18:36.959  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Active duty military service, are you currently? So, no.

200  
00:18:48.770 \--\> 00:18:58.610  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: It stated discovery of Benefits Review, but no, ma'am, I wasn't clear that it was a review. I was under the assumption that I was going actually more in depth to what I clicked on.  
201  
00:18:58.810 \--\> 00:19:04.830  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: to the actual benefits, what it was going to show me to understand my benefits, though it would be, you know, more of a breakdown.  
202

Moderator: And… So… The transitioning service members…  
320  
00:31:02.820 \--\> 00:31:13.739  
Moderator: title. Also, I want to confirm that, like, when you saw that, you thought that that meant that all the benefits were just for transitioning service members. Yes, that's what I assumed.  
321  
00:31:13.740 \--\> 00:31:25.330  
Moderator: Okay, this is really good insight, because we, we need to make it clear that actually most of these benefits are available to people no matter  
322  
00:31:25.330 \--\> 00:31:28.509  
Moderator: How long that they've been out of active duty.  
323  
00:31:28.740 \--\> 00:31:29.570  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
324  
00:31:29.570 \--\> 00:31:36.789  
Moderator: You know, these are… some of… very few of these are available to somebody in their first…  
325  
00:31:36.800 \--\> 00:31:54.920  
Moderator: you know, like, a year before they separate, or, like, a year after they separate, but the majority of them are for everybody, so that really needs to be clear. So now, knowing that, a lot of these benefits are available to you as a person who separated several years ago.  
326  
00:31:55.380 \--\> 00:32:01.970  
Moderator: I would like you to, keep using this page to explore benefits you might be interested in.

P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I will do. I'm making up the chances.

00:32:31.150 \--\> 00:32:32.939  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I knew about the education.  
329  
00:32:34.370 \--\> 00:32:35.970  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So I don't need to speak on that.  
330  
00:32:37.940 \--\> 00:32:40.830  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'm gonna click on More Support. It might tell me

P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: And I plot of filters.

00:32:48.840 \--\> 00:32:59.340  
Moderator: benefits, how does… how do the categories look for you? Do you see anything that's missing? Do you think anything, anything that doesn't make sense?

00:33:01.070 \--\> 00:33:06.080  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Bears and memorials, I mean, everything, literally, I mean, it's… it's…  
335  
00:33:06.720 \--\> 00:33:14.269  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: stuff that vets would, you know, service members would need to know about, so… I'm trying to think of what could possibly be added, but…  
336  
00:33:15.470 \--\> 00:33:24.500  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I mean, I know there's things like recreational activities, for example. I didn't even know this, but I met a Vietnam vet, and he had asked me.  
337  
00:33:24.760 \--\> 00:33:25.940  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Excuse me.

339  
00:33:28.370 \--\> 00:33:40.680  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: well, you know, whether or not you knew about, you know, you can get fishing license and state parks and things like that, but I think that would be good to put on here as a topic as well, so people can actually know  
340  
00:33:41.020 \--\> 00:33:52.169  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: like, from different states, what's eligible, like, what they can, you know, get, like, even with your, you know, housing exemptions for the older people that I don't know, they know about that for taxes and things like that.  
341  
00:33:52.880 \--\> 00:34:03.600  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, I think that would be some interesting tabs that could be put, and you know, you can just direct and click on it to know what's available from state to state, because again, all states are different.  
342  
00:34:04.530 \--\> 00:34:07.950  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So that, that, that, that will be helpful, I think.

350  
00:34:42.560 \--\> 00:34:49.219  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes, ma'am, and to… to… I would assume after applying the filters, more things would have populated in the system, like…  
351  
00:34:50.409 \--\> 00:34:52.719  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Subtitles underneath, you know.  
352  
00:34:53.710 \--\> 00:34:55.590  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: This, that was my assumption.  
353  
00:34:55.900 \--\> 00:35:02.060  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: under more support, I thought more things would have populated to where I could see what else was there, you know, to be offered.

359  
00:35:30.230 \--\> 00:35:35.729  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Well, I was literally saying, I didn't even read that. Each state has their own list of benefits and resources that they provide.  
360  
00:35:35.960 \--\> 00:35:38.360  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Well, if they're gonna state this.

363  
00:35:45.940 \--\> 00:35:54.319

373  
00:36:46.090 \--\> 00:36:52.120

00:42:03.880 \--\> 00:42:04.640  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes.  
430  
00:42:04.640 \--\> 00:42:13.030  
Moderator: okay, that it would populate more benefits, and that, you know, clicking Apply Filters would… would… you'd see… you'd see more.  
431  
00:42:13.080 \--\> 00:42:30.080  
Moderator: I would like you, to do it a little bit differently this time, where you go up, scroll up a little bit, a little bit down, where right… okay, so right where it says filters,  
432  
00:42:30.820 \--\> 00:42:41.419  
Moderator: Based on everything you've seen so far, when you come to this page and you don't click anything, how do you think that…  
433  
00:42:41.950 \--\> 00:42:49.170  
Moderator: the results… are… How do you think the results are showing for you?  
434  
00:42:50.870 \--\> 00:42:53.550  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Without clicking anything, just looking at this page.  
435  
00:42:53.550 \--\> 00:42:54.020  
Moderator: Yeah.  
436  
00:42:54.020 \--\> 00:42:59.780  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'm just… I'm curious as to say… it's saying show results, show only results.  
437  
00:42:59.870 \--\> 00:43:14.580  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: recommended for you. I'm trying to understand what exactly does that mean? Like, if you don't click on it, does that mean it's gonna recommend things that's not for you? Like, otherwise, why would I be on this page if I wasn't looking for something for me? It's like, why is that there to me?  
438  
00:43:15.590 \--\> 00:43:18.229  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Like a no-nonsense type thing in my head.  
439  
00:43:18.230 \--\> 00:43:21.779  
Moderator: And then, when to apply, I think that's important, because it's…  
440  
00:43:22.290 \--\> 00:43:26.620  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Before and after separation, if you are making it to where it's for  
441  
00:43:26.740 \--\> 00:43:31.179  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: All military, whether you're active or, you know, vets, then that makes sense to me.  
442  
00:43:31.330 \--\> 00:43:32.840  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: The benefit type.  
443  
00:43:33.000 \--\> 00:43:35.150  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: makes sense to me. I mean…  
444  
00:43:36.980 \--\> 00:43:43.300  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: it's alphabetical order, I mean, the way it's easy navigation to it is just, again, I would…  
445  
00:43:44.290 \--\> 00:44:00.770  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: add more, like, one more tab. Like, if let recreational just fall underneath that, or, you know, housing, you have housing assistance. I didn't click on it to really see. I did click on housing assistance, see what else fell underneath that, but just getting more direct to the things that  
446  
00:44:01.090 \--\> 00:44:10.560  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: putting yourself in a situation of what it is that that would entail when vets go, when they want to, you know, seek a house, you know, the certificate of eligibility, just being more direct, not…  
447  
00:44:11.350 \--\> 00:44:22.620  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: because we already know what it is, most of us, like, coming out of what it is that, you know, we need in order to get something, and we just want to go and get it. You know what I mean? Like, just go to it. But it's like…  
448  
00:44:22.790 \--\> 00:44:32.690  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: The navigation process is just too many, like, loops to me to jump through to get to what we actually need, like, to the form of filing and, you know, submitting it and all that part.  
449  
00:44:33.320 \--\> 00:44:37.930  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: That's… that's… that's all I have to say about this particular page, ma'am.  
450  
00:44:38.310 \--\> 00:44:41.909  
Moderator: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  
451  
00:44:43.370 \--\> 00:44:54.139  
Moderator: So now that you don't have any… anything checked, no filters, nothing, could you scroll down a little bit further and look at where it… under it says, your results?  
452  
00:44:54.260 \--\> 00:44:58.160  
Moderator: So, what I'd like you to do is…  
453  
00:44:58.540 \--\> 00:45:10.429  
Moderator: just, read through, and… oh, actually, because we're doing kind of a fresh start here, I would like you to go up and click Apply.  
454  
00:45:11.840 \--\> 00:45:12.390  
Moderator: Yeah.  
455  
00:45:12.390 \--\> 00:45:13.280  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Apply filters.  
456  
00:45:13.280 \--\> 00:45:13.950  
Moderator: Yeah.  
457  
00:45:14.100 \--\> 00:45:17.429  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, before I do that, can I ask you a question?  
458  
00:45:17.430 \--\> 00:45:18.300  
Moderator: Certainly.  
459  
00:45:18.510 \--\> 00:45:26.390  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: For the, sort, the expiration date, soonest to 1st, what is this about? Like, the results for… I'm not understanding, like, what does that…  
460  
00:45:26.780 \--\> 00:45:32.290  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Expiration date soon as first, like, based on… What it's offering.  
461  
00:45:32.640 \--\> 00:45:36.610  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: like, what… how is it applicable to anything, is what I'm trying to understand.  
462  
00:45:36.790 \--\> 00:45:46.569  
Moderator: Yeah, that's a great question. So, when that applies, is that sometimes when someone is transitioning, you know, when they're a year.  
463  
00:45:46.570 \--\> 00:45:57.650  
Moderator: before they separate, a year after they separate. There's things like life insurance that you have to apply right away. So that's… Okay. So as a…  
464  
00:45:57.770 \--\> 00:46:02.099  
Moderator: Veteran, who has been out for a while like you.  
465  
00:46:02.230 \--\> 00:46:05.409  
Moderator: You're not gonna see expiration dates.  
466  
00:46:05.910 \--\> 00:46:06.790  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
467  
00:46:07.130 \--\> 00:46:08.359  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I understand.  
468  
00:46:08.750 \--\> 00:46:11.190  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Thank you. Thank you so much.  
469  
00:46:11.470 \--\> 00:46:12.210  
Moderator: Of course.  
470  
00:46:12.620 \--\> 00:46:18.590  
Moderator: And also, I want to reiterate that this is something that we need to make more clear. Like, this is… this is not…  
471  
00:46:18.590 \--\> 00:46:22.010  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I understand. Yes, ma'am, I understand.  
472  
00:46:22.110 \--\> 00:46:31.360  
Moderator: Yeah, I just don't ever want anybody who's helping us out with something like this to feel like our design problems are, you know, something that you're doing wrong.  
473  
00:46:31.360 \--\> 00:46:37.430  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I appreciate that, ma'am. And I'm listening to you, and I'm clicking on Apply Filters, as you said, and…  
474  
00:46:38.770 \--\> 00:46:43.239  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Transition Assistance Program tab pops up from underneath, versus  
475  
00:46:43.810 \--\> 00:46:58.420  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: literally, you know, how it was geared to, you know, personal. The TAB program provides information services and training to help you plan for your transition and meet your post-military goals. One to apply up to two years before you separate from service.  
476  
00:46:59.380 \--\> 00:47:03.650  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Then it says Careers and Employment, DOD Skill Bridge Program. The DOD…  
477  
00:47:03.810 \--\> 00:47:13.090  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Skill-based program can help you gain valuable civilian work experience through specific industry training, apprenticeships, or internships. See, this right here is…  
478  
00:47:14.310 \--\> 00:47:18.340  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: very informative. Like, again, I could have used this in my life.  
479  
00:47:19.680 \--\> 00:47:28.590  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: transfer your GI Bill. You may be able to transfer your unused post-911 GI Bill to your spouse or dependent children. Learn about this process now to request  
480  
00:47:28.870 \--\> 00:47:34.290  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Transfer, transfer of benefits, so… Oh, wow.  
481  
00:47:34.850 \--\> 00:47:39.689  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Is this something, literally, that's just being done? Like, because… or I just missed it?  
482  
00:47:40.620 \--\> 00:47:45.119  
Moderator: Yeah, we started working on this about a year and a half ago.  
483  
00:47:45.120 \--\> 00:47:45.940  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Wow.  
484  
00:47:45.940 \--\> 00:47:58.309  
Moderator: Yeah, because of what you were saying earlier, you know, you said that there were benefits like life insurance and TRICARE that you didn't know that you needed to transfer, you didn't know that you needed to change. Right.  
485  
00:47:58.420 \--\> 00:48:03.420  
Moderator: This is for somebody who's getting out of the military right now, so they don't have to wander.  
486  
00:48:03.630 \--\> 00:48:07.779  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Wow. Well, this is very important information, and it's… yeah.  
487  
00:48:08.990 \--\> 00:48:11.760  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: This makes a lot of sense. I'm listening to you.  
488  
00:48:11.760 \--\> 00:48:17.870  
Moderator: Yeah, so at the same time, it's also for veterans, but…  
489  
00:48:18.160 \--\> 00:48:34.040  
Moderator: it looks… we know that we have some work to do to make it more clear that, you know, it is also for veterans, it's not just for transitioning service members. So, some of the questions you're asking are really helping us answer those questions.  
490  
00:48:34.600 \--\> 00:48:40.119  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, thank you. And I need to actually look at Disability Housing Grant.  
491  
00:48:40.240 \--\> 00:48:41.740  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: while I'm on here.  
492  
00:48:42.440 \--\> 00:48:47.169  
Moderator: Certainly. I would love it if you could explore that, you know, just by  
493  
00:48:47.860 \--\> 00:48:51.489  
Moderator: Because it sounds like you're… you might want that benefit, so go ahead.  
494  
00:48:51.490 \--\> 00:48:52.649  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes, ma'am.  
495  
00:48:53.260 \--\> 00:48:56.270  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'm not trying to hold you all up or anything either, so…  
496  
00:48:56.270 \--\> 00:48:58.160  
Moderator: We have plenty of time.  
497  
00:48:58.430 \--\> 00:49:01.849  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, we offer housing grants for veterans and service members of certain…  
498  
00:49:01.970 \--\> 00:49:14.030  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: service-connected disabilities so they can run a change of changing home to meet their needs to live more independently. Changing home might involve installing ramps or widening doorways, finding if you're eligible, or disability housing, or how to apply.  
499  
00:49:14.430 \--\> 00:49:16.750  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Grant eligibility for your permanent home.  
500  
00:49:17.860 \--\> 00:49:20.299  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Can I get a specially adapted housing grant?  
501  
00:49:21.190 \--\> 00:49:23.069  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: You may be able to meet a…  
502  
00:49:23.830 \--\> 00:49:32.180  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Let's see, H, if you're using the grant money to buy a builder, change your permanent home, a home you plan to live in for a long time, and you meet those requirements.  
503  
00:49:32.920 \--\> 00:49:35.130  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Your own will or will, okay, on the home?  
504  
00:49:35.310 \--\> 00:49:38.570  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: And of course, cocaine Military Services Ability.  
505  
00:49:40.190 \--\> 00:49:45.279  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: The loss or lost use of more than one limb, the loss or loss of a lower leg, and the residual lasting effects.  
506  
00:49:45.960 \--\> 00:49:50.490  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Flies in both eyes, certain severe burns, the loss of lower extremity.  
507  
00:49:53.310 \--\> 00:49:54.320  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
508  
00:50:00.380 \--\> 00:50:02.089  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: You may be able to showcase.  
509  
00:50:02.530 \--\> 00:50:05.410  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: It's a great living builder, private home builder.  
510  
00:50:05.890 \--\> 00:50:09.459  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, for example, I'm not done reading it.  
511  
00:50:10.150 \--\> 00:50:14.700  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: But I know this is not nothing you all change versus the eligibility side of things.  
512  
00:50:14.950 \--\> 00:50:21.460  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So I guess this question, I'll just keep it to myself, just versus… What classifies it?  
513  
00:50:21.590 \--\> 00:50:23.080  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: your eligibility.  
514  
00:50:28.530 \--\> 00:50:32.360  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I guess what I'm saying is, me being a veteran.  
515  
00:50:32.510 \--\> 00:50:38.519  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: and having service-connected issues with the military, you know, and it's 100% the issues that I have.  
516  
00:50:39.580 \--\> 00:50:42.480  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: And owning your own home, but it's just…  
517  
00:50:44.270 \--\> 00:50:50.109  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I don't know that… I'm not seeing the eligibility that it would be… that I would… that would be considered.  
518  
00:50:50.310 \--\> 00:50:55.049  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: even versus connections to it, so that's all I wanted to know. We can proceed.  
519  
00:50:55.610 \--\> 00:51:07.439  
Moderator: Yeah, and I noticed that that information is on the page, but there's a lot of information on this page, and there's a lot.  
520  
00:51:07.730 \--\> 00:51:12.039  
Moderator: It's complex, and there's a lot of information.  
521  
00:51:14.100 \--\> 00:51:21.050  
Moderator: What, had you… Heard of this benefit before you found it, just now?  
522  
00:51:21.800 \--\> 00:51:26.359  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: And no, ma'am, never heard of it. That's why, when I saw it, I was like, okay, let me…  
523  
00:51:26.770 \--\> 00:51:29.600  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Read it. I've never heard of this before.

525  
00:51:36.670 \--\> 00:51:40.090  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So am I. Thank you. Thank you very much.  
526  
00:51:42.300 \--\> 00:51:48.479  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Well, now I'm just… I'm done, because I'm going to do my research. Now that I know SEH, I'm gonna go and look it up.  
527  
00:51:48.640 \--\> 00:51:52.979  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: on the outside of this, so I'm focused on what I'm doing with you, so…

00:52:51.020 \--\> 00:52:53.900  
Moderator: So if you could go back up to the filters…  
543  
00:52:54.650 \--\> 00:53:02.049  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So I'm trying to move the… the thing… there we go. Sometimes it, like, gets stuck. You say go back to the filters up here?  
544  
00:53:02.490 \--\> 00:53:04.480  
Moderator: Okay. And, and take your time.  
545  
00:53:06.600 \--\> 00:53:07.529  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: There we go.  
546

547  
00:53:12.470 \--\> 00:53:22.470

548  
00:53:22.770 \--\> 00:53:23.590  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
549  
00:53:25.730 \--\> 00:53:27.140  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I clicked on it.  
550  
00:53:27.400 \--\> 00:53:28.260  
Moderator: Okay.  
551  
00:53:28.740 \--\> 00:53:36.850

552  
00:53:37.710 \--\> 00:53:40.230  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, so just show only recommended for me results.  
553  
00:53:40.230 \--\> 00:53:40.710  
Moderator: And then…  
554  
00:53:40.710 \--\> 00:53:42.170  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: It's just supply filter, got it.  
555  
00:53:42.170 \--\> 00:53:42.870  
Moderator: Yeah.  
556  
00:53:44.490 \--\> 00:53:45.330  
Moderator: Okay.  
557  
00:53:45.460 \--\> 00:53:51.879  
Moderator: And so now, I'd like… I'd like you to scroll down to your results and explore it that way.  
558  
00:53:52.530 \--\> 00:53:58.340  
Moderator: Based on you having clicked that, what's your expectation about what you're gonna be seeing right now?  
559  
00:54:01.000 \--\> 00:54:03.860  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: You qualify for syllabus Day.  
560  
00:54:14.790 \--\> 00:54:18.719  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'm going through it in my head, ma'am, I'm coming. Let's see.  
561  
00:54:19.570 \--\> 00:54:21.980  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So just show only results for you.  
562  
00:54:24.970 \--\> 00:54:26.600  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Apply filters.  
563  
00:54:28.810 \--\> 00:54:48.199  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: is this, like, a general input? Like, I know this is, like, a prototype, but it's, like, generally, like, if you would come on and just input the information as is, is this, like, a real run-through of what would actually populate in the system for everyone, or just, like… I know it's, you know, like, just me, or is this just something… you understand what I'm trying to ask, pretty much?  
564  
00:54:48.200 \--\> 00:54:48.970  
Moderator: Yeah.  
565  
00:54:49.280 \--\> 00:54:57.069  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Because if so, like, how… How would… like, how… why would disability compensation be the first thing  
566  
00:54:57.340 \--\> 00:55:01.760  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: that populates, you know? I mean, most people looking for  
567  
00:55:03.560 \--\> 00:55:06.370  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Compensation, or dealing with, you know, their,  
568  
00:55:06.630 \--\> 00:55:16.360  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: percentage rating, etc. So, I get that. So, would that be the first thing that populates for everybody? Like, how is… how is the algorithm to where that pops up?  
569  
00:55:17.150 \--\> 00:55:23.660  
Moderator: That is… that is really, really important feedback, and I'm not going to answer that question until we.  
570  
00:55:23.660 \--\> 00:55:24.170  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, okay.  
571  
00:55:24.170 \--\> 00:55:25.729  
Moderator: one more time, because…  
572  
00:55:25.730 \--\> 00:55:26.140  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
573  
00:55:26.140 \--\> 00:55:30.140  
Moderator: yeah, we'll come back to that.  
574  
00:55:30.140 \--\> 00:55:32.540  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, well then…  
575  
00:55:32.840 \--\> 00:55:43.599  
Moderator: Because it'll… not knowing… not knowing how it's working is gonna help me understand, you know, whether we're communicating that correctly. So that's why I'm gonna hold off on answering that question.  
576  
00:55:43.600 \--\> 00:55:46.249  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, yes, ma'am. Okay, no worries.  
577  
00:55:46.390 \--\> 00:55:49.790  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: When to apply before or after your serve… from service.  
578  
00:55:51.840 \--\> 00:55:53.829  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I think those are recommended for your housing.  
579  
00:55:55.720 \--\> 00:55:58.419  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I mean, I guess the only thing that I could… I mean…  
580  
00:55:59.290 \--\> 00:56:00.980  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: To a certain service that you…  
581  
00:56:01.480 \--\> 00:56:15.880  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: housing grant. These are all things that I know, just getting out of the military, if this is literally just for transitioning, and from staying focused on the topic of what I'm doing here, then all this makes sense. It does make sense, because these are things that  
582  
00:56:16.140 \--\> 00:56:17.030  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know.  
583  
00:56:17.310 \--\> 00:56:23.120  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: they're gonna need, and, you know, that I would initially have questions, kind of like a general list of things, pretty much.  
584  
00:56:23.920 \--\> 00:56:30.520  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Of what you would, what you would want to know and have, like, right there. That's important.  
585  
00:56:30.740 \--\> 00:56:34.710  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So, state, okay, state veterans, benefits, uniforms, okay?  
586  
00:56:35.460 \--\> 00:56:41.680  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Now, why is, like, it… the question, like, it answered, I… the question I asked is being answered right now.  
587  
00:56:42.270 \--\> 00:56:44.420  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Throw me at what I'm looking at now.  
588  
00:56:44.700 \--\> 00:56:50.370  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So… the VA Dental Health Services, When to apply.  
589  
00:56:50.620 \--\> 00:57:02.679  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: And it's important because you all are actually saying when to apply, you know, before and after, and then when you click on learn more, I know it's going to break it down, but I still want to look at everything that's recommended for me before I click on one of these.  
590  
00:57:03.930 \--\> 00:57:06.730  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Housing assist and VA-backed home loans.  
591  
00:57:08.280 \--\> 00:57:10.940  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: When to apply, education, reticent.  
592  
00:57:11.060 \--\> 00:57:16.100  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Y'all are really doing some awesome stuff here. Like, really, really awesome, because…  
593  
00:57:16.890 \--\> 00:57:21.540  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Again, if this would have been 10, 12 years ago, this would have been even better.  
594  
00:57:22.170 \--\> 00:57:24.210  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Vet Success on Campus.  
595  
00:57:24.680 \--\> 00:57:26.479  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Foreign Medical Program.  
596  
00:57:28.140 \--\> 00:57:30.850  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Outside the consumer may cover your costs.  
597  
00:57:31.010 \--\> 00:57:32.830  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Never heard of that before.  
598  
00:57:33.480 \--\> 00:57:51.439  
Moderator: So, to answer your question from earlier, the reason you're seeing what you're seeing is based on the answers that you put in the form, where you said, you know, I am a veteran, I have already transitioned, I have a disability rating, I have an honorable discharge.  
599  
00:57:51.440 \--\> 00:57:53.080  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Those are all…  
600  
00:57:53.080 \--\> 00:57:59.309  
Moderator: recommendation factors. So, what you're seeing… Is…  
601  
00:57:59.600 \--\> 00:58:04.290  
Moderator: based on those questions. Another question for you…  
602  
00:58:04.660 \--\> 00:58:09.020  
Moderator: What is your theory on why things are in the order that they're in?  
603  
00:58:11.830 \--\> 00:58:13.120  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: my theory…  
604  
00:58:13.420 \--\> 00:58:16.869  
Moderator: Like, why do you think you're seeing flexibility first?  
605  
00:58:19.010 \--\> 00:58:21.250  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: because I'm a disabled veteran, for one.  
606  
00:58:21.560 \--\> 00:58:28.230  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I mean… literally, and I guess it would be anything else that can be available to me.  
607  
00:58:28.680 \--\> 00:58:31.320  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: that I will be offered based on  
608  
00:58:31.440 \--\> 00:58:46.070  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, everything, like you said, that I literally just put into the system is just based off of my input, and it's taking it from there, and it just, I guess, expanded it a bit of possibly, you know, anything else that could be offered to me that I could seek and look out.  
609  
00:58:46.690 \--\> 00:58:48.450  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: That, you know, might be of aid.  
610  
00:58:49.330 \--\> 00:58:54.739  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: That's… the only answer that I have. I mean, that makes sense to me.  
611  
00:58:57.110 \--\> 00:59:04.050  
Moderator: Did you notice, when you were scrolling, that there's a box if you scroll up a little bit?  
612  
00:59:05.370 \--\> 00:59:12.130

613  
00:59:12.890 \--\> 00:59:14.669  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Sword Exploration,  
614  
00:59:14.670 \--\> 00:59:17.399  
Moderator: How do you think that's affect… affecting…  
615  
00:59:17.870 \--\> 00:59:20.059  
Moderator: The way the results are displayed.  
616  
00:59:24.470 \--\> 00:59:30.430  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah, I'm trying to think backwards now. How do I think it's… the way it's affecting the way the results are displayed?  
617  
00:59:30.770 \--\> 00:59:33.480  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: showing soonest to 1st. It should be…  
618  
00:59:40.890 \--\> 00:59:45.850  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'm trying to make sense out of it, versus what would be… And I'd say more.  
619  
00:59:47.550 \--\> 00:59:53.900  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: applicable, but what, what, what would be, like, take precedent? I mean, it's… I don't even know how to answer this.  
620  
00:59:54.390 \--\> 00:59:58.200  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Like, it's kind of like, to me, I'm thinking in my mind, like, prioritizing.  
621  
00:59:59.140 \--\> 01:00:03.070  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: What would be… Not say needed, but…  
622  
01:00:03.190 \--\> 01:00:09.769  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I can't think of the latter, but in my head, I know what I'm trying to say. But to convey it, I'm having difficulty.  
623  
01:00:10.280 \--\> 01:00:15.140  
Moderator: Yeah, totally. Do you mean, like, highest impact, most important, biggest?  
624  
01:00:15.450 \--\> 01:00:18.450  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes, but as it relates to… to me.  
625  
01:00:18.820 \--\> 01:00:19.590  
Moderator: Right.  
626  
01:00:21.910 \--\> 01:00:24.740  
Moderator: Gotcha. That makes a lot of sense.  
627  
01:00:24.740 \--\> 01:00:37.379  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Does it really? Because in my head, it made sense, but saying it out loud, it didn't make too much sense, but I understand what I'm saying, and what you're saying is pretty much what I'm saying, but I'm just trying to…  
628  
01:00:38.100 \--\> 01:00:48.619  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: still understand at the same time. If I change this to, for example, ANZ, can I do that so I can see if it's going to change here? Will that make a difference, or don't do that?  
629  
01:00:48.620 \--\> 01:00:50.150  
Moderator: Do it and see what happens.  
630  
01:00:50.150 \--\> 01:00:51.080  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
631  
01:01:02.810 \--\> 01:01:03.660  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
632  
01:01:03.960 \--\> 01:01:09.509  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: It's still the same thing. No, it did change, because foreign medical program, that wasn't…  
633  
01:01:09.680 \--\> 01:01:11.729  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I don't think that was a third one.  
634  
01:01:13.470 \--\> 01:01:16.060  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Disability Compensation, disability housing grant.  
635  
01:01:16.380 \--\> 01:01:17.380  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Let me see…  
636  
01:01:32.190 \--\> 01:01:33.760  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: It did change.  
637  
01:01:39.850 \--\> 01:01:45.580  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Because foreign… Was the third one.  
638  
01:01:46.590 \--\> 01:01:49.380  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: now… Okay.  
639  
01:01:58.140 \--\> 01:02:04.630  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: But the… I'm… I'm still… I guess it's still kind of, like, confusing to me, in all honesty.  
640  
01:02:04.630 \--\> 01:02:09.739  
Moderator: Because when they're saying type of benefit A through Z, it's just populating those benefits.  
641  
01:02:09.740 \--\> 01:02:13.669  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: beginning with A through Z, you know what I'm saying? It's like, it's just…  
642  
01:02:15.170 \--\> 01:02:20.339  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: it's kind of… just the way you're reading it is like, what do you mean, type of benefits A through Z?  
643  
01:02:21.430 \--\> 01:02:22.660  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: You know what I mean? It's like, it's not…  
644  
01:02:22.660 \--\> 01:02:23.280  
Moderator: Yeah.  
645  
01:02:23.280 \--\> 01:02:31.419  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: clear enough in my mind, because that's why I asked you in the beginning, like, what do you… what does that mean, sort type from latest, you know, it's just like it…  
646  
01:02:33.750 \--\> 01:02:37.100  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Because if this is A through Z, this is still all of them, but…  
647  
01:02:37.400 \--\> 01:02:46.209  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: so it'll populate everything from A to Z, literally, starting from the first letter of the word? I mean, like, what is it picking up on, you know what I mean?  
648  
01:02:46.490 \--\> 01:03:03.820  
Moderator: That's a great… that's a great question. It's really good to know that that's unclear. Question for you. So, when you're going benefit by benefit, when you're looking at the benefits, what grabs your eye first? Like, what are you noticing first on the results?  
649  
01:03:05.110 \--\> 01:03:06.279  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: What's in bold?  
650  
01:03:06.570 \--\> 01:03:11.469  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: the VA National, like, the bold letters, that's the first thing that I see.  
651  
01:03:12.780 \--\> 01:03:14.510  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So it tells me, you know.  
652  
01:03:15.760 \--\> 01:03:18.840  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: What's gonna fall underneath there, which is helpful.  
653  
01:03:24.780 \--\> 01:03:40.370  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I mean, of course I see the recommended for you, but that's not really what I'm looking at. You know, I'm, like, disregarding that, because if I applied the filters the way I did, I know that's what's going to pop up, so I'm looking at the main topics, and, you know, what's bold is popping up, which is the…  
654  
01:03:40.530 \--\> 01:03:45.199  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: VA National Cemetery, burial, and the when to apply.  
655  
01:03:46.150 \--\> 01:03:55.439  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: You know, which is, you know, important to see, versus if this is what I needed to go with, then I can click on the learn more and take it from there.  
656  
01:03:57.190 \--\> 01:03:59.440  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: So I think that setup is, you know.  
657  
01:04:00.080 \--\> 01:04:02.520  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: It's okay. It's good to me.  
658  
01:04:03.020 \--\> 01:04:03.700  
Moderator: Okay.  
659  
01:04:05.290 \--\> 01:04:12.709  
Moderator: So, we're getting close to time, let's wrap up. I have a couple of last questions for you.  
660  
01:04:12.710 \--\> 01:04:13.880  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes, ma'am.  
661  
01:04:14.750 \--\> 01:04:18.090  
Moderator: Okay, let me just make sure I got my notes in front of me.  
662  
01:04:28.030 \--\> 01:04:29.320  
Moderator: So…  
663  
01:04:29.880 \--\> 01:04:44.070  
Moderator: You, you have explained pretty clearly why this would be helpful for somebody who is transitioning, who needs to know about expiring benefits, who needs to know about applying for disability compensation for the first time.  
664  
01:04:44.250 \--\> 01:04:55.240  
Moderator: For you, as somebody who has been… who has transitioned out of active duty service for some time now, is this helpful for you?  
665  
01:04:55.990 \--\> 01:04:58.000  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I definitely think so, yes ma'am.  
666  
01:04:58.620 \--\> 01:05:00.669  
Moderator: What is helpful about it?  
667  
01:05:01.270 \--\> 01:05:05.910  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: the fact that I'm finding out things I didn't even know I was eligible for. For example, the SHA.  
668  
01:05:06.040 \--\> 01:05:08.489  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: And the… for the,  
669  
01:05:08.600 \--\> 01:05:23.539  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: transferring about the post-GI… post-911 GI Bill, that was something with the education side of things as well. That was also helpful to, learn. And just know that it's out there, and I can go and look at it and see, you know.  
670  
01:05:23.820 \--\> 01:05:28.589  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: What actually is available to me as a veteran, even after all these years of being out.  
671  
01:05:28.700 \--\> 01:05:32.110  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: You know, it's… It's a need to know, because…  
672  
01:05:32.820 \--\> 01:05:37.070  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I didn't know. Known as a site you can go to and have that available to you.  
673  
01:05:39.400 \--\> 01:05:45.610  
Moderator: What would you rate this on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5… 1 being the worst, 5 being the best?  
674  
01:05:47.570 \--\> 01:05:51.350  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I would say… Four… four and a half.  
675  
01:05:52.330 \--\> 01:05:53.799  
Moderator: What would make it better?  
676  
01:05:55.620 \--\> 01:06:02.059  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Literally, that one little thing, like I said, versus adding to the… all the topics of the drop-down.  
677  
01:06:02.930 \--\> 01:06:08.970  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Putting in recreational, something like that, to also… to give all the benefits, not just, you know.  
678  
01:06:09.210 \--\> 01:06:15.929  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: what's on there now. Just some of the fun things as well that's available to vets, not just, you know, the business side of things.  
679  
01:06:17.350 \--\> 01:06:37.079  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: I think that would be, helpful. And just the navigation… the navigation… navigation… gating of it all is not bad, but it's just still… it brings you to… it's just over… I think it'll be overwhelming. I don't mind reading, but I just, again, I look at the elderly, too. It's a lot to keep going through, through, and through, to get to what you, you know, really need.  
680  
01:06:37.900 \--\> 01:06:40.350  
Moderator: Yeah, and…  
681  
01:06:40.510 \--\> 01:06:52.150  
Moderator: we've gotta… we've gotta make it… we've… we've gotta make it work more clearly for, magnification users like you, because I know that there's… there's some things that we can do better.  
682  
01:06:52.390 \--\> 01:07:01.230  
Moderator: Yes, ma'am. To make it more clear. I really appreciate you surfacing all of those issues. This has been enormously helpful.  
683  
01:07:04.180 \--\> 01:07:23.570  
Moderator: So to wrap up, I want to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. To remind you, we will remove all information that can be used to identify you before sharing, to only share the videos with them to… with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
684  
01:07:24.250 \--\> 01:07:25.959  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes, ma'am, I'm okay with that.  
685  
01:07:25.960 \--\> 01:07:30.000  
Moderator: Is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?  
686  
01:07:30.910 \--\> 01:07:36.209  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: No, ma'am, it's nothing at all. Everything is fine. What works and helps, then that's fine. I'm okay with it.  
687  
01:07:37.280 \--\> 01:07:54.809  
Moderator: Great. So, I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts. Your feedback is enormously helpful. You… you found some things that we really need to know about, and your… your time and effort is very much appreciated. Finally.  
688  
01:07:55.140 \--\> 01:07:57.080  
Moderator: the,  
689  
01:07:57.480 \--\> 01:08:06.690  
Moderator: Paragian's gonna be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb you can pass along to other veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies, so…  
690  
01:08:06.690 \--\> 01:08:07.870  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes, ma'am.  
691  
01:08:07.870 \--\> 01:08:11.649  
Moderator: That's it, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day, and have a great weekend.  
692  
01:08:11.650 \--\> 01:08:18.250  
P15 \[Screen magnification user\]: Thank you all, you all do the same, and be safe with the weather. Oh yeah, you too. Bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.
