| Complete questionnaire easily | Yes |
| Questionnaire observations | Rules out what doesn't apply to him Is curious what plan for my and my family's future includes (Finance, dependents, get family on medical?) Big difference in separating 3 years ago vs 10 or 20 years ago (previous questions were big increments, but this one is smaller increments). He's been out 11 years now. Disability claim might not be clear if you have a rating, but also have a claim in process. |
| Finding sort | No |
| Notes on finding sort | Only sees sort after noticing recommended vs all results Doesn't understand why expiration date is there when nothing is actually time-sensitive for him |
| Use sort as expected? | No |
| Notes on using sort | Assumption would be what's been used the most based on filters Looks for sort, but finds recommended vs all results Switches it to Name A-Z |
| Finding filters | Yes |
| Notes on finding filters | Filtered immediately because there were 15, but there aren't a lot. Card is bland and not eye-catching, so he wanted to filter right away. Thinks radio should automatically apply, but checkboxes shouldn't. |

| Notes on using filters | After separation, Careers and employment, Education, Health care, Life insurance |
| Exploring and understanding recommended vs all | Yes with help |

| Notes on finding benefit information | Wants to see multiple cards at a time in row design (less scrolling and fixed filters) Scanning headings Didn't find any benefits he didn't already know about \- has already done a lot of research over the last 10 years. State benefits may be something he looks into. |
| Is this tool helpful for you in your life today? | Yes |
| Notes on helpful in life today | 0 |
| Satisfaction 1-5 | 3 |
| Notes on satisfaction | VA wording and style could be better (fonts, sizes) |
| What would you change about this tool to help someone transitioning from Active Duty? | 0 |

1  
00:00:09.990 \--\> 00:00:16.630  
Moderator: Okay, I've started recording. I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  
2  
00:00:16.890 \--\> 00:00:17.580  
P12: Yes.  
3  
00:00:18.270 \--\> 00:00:26.969  
Moderator: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that could be used to identify you?  
4  
00:00:27.280 \--\> 00:00:27.990  
P12: Yes.  
5  
00:00:30.720 \--\> 00:00:36.820  
Moderator: So, can you tell me what services you use on GA.gov, usually?  
6  
00:00:38.830 \--\> 00:00:46.129  
P12: Well… I've applied for… My claim… well, some claims…  
7  
00:00:46.370 \--\> 00:00:51.080  
P12: that a long time ago, but I think it was mainly for my education benefits.  
8  
00:00:51.630 \--\> 00:00:53.320  
P12: About 11 years ago.  
9  
00:00:54.710 \--\> 00:01:03.670  
P12: And then… I used it… I don't remember if I used it to add dependents to my disability claims.  
10  
00:01:04.269 \--\> 00:01:06.180  
P12: But now I use it…  
11  
00:01:07.070 \--\> 00:01:12.780  
P12: To, you know, message my providers, because my healthy vet has kind of gone away.  
12  
00:01:13.270 \--\> 00:01:19.379  
P12: I use it to look up medical records, I use it to look up my benefits letter.  
13  
00:01:21.260 \--\> 00:01:34.510  
P12: you know, direct… My claims for mild, or, travel reimbursement, Let's see… that's… Yeah, that's… that's probably it.  
14  
00:01:35.580 \--\> 00:01:37.510  
Moderator: Yeah, so a lot of different services.  
15  
00:01:38.320 \--\> 00:01:42.019  
Moderator: How… Often would you say that you log on to the site?  
16  
00:01:43.490 \--\> 00:01:44.769  
P12: Probably once a week.  
17  
00:01:46.040 \--\> 00:01:54.399  
Moderator: Would you say that you log in, most of the time you use it, or do you ever spend time on the part of the website where you're not logging in?  
18  
00:01:55.220 \--\> 00:01:57.610  
P12: No, I usually log in.  
19  
00:01:58.340 \--\> 00:02:01.609  
P12: Yeah, it's usually, you know, for medical stuff,  
20  
00:02:01.990 \--\> 00:02:04.709  
P12: You know, I've used the site a little bit to try to…  
21  
00:02:05.830 \--\> 00:02:10.640  
P12: Because before, for travel reimbursement for, like, doctor's appointments, you used to have to…  
22  
00:02:10.940 \--\> 00:02:16.100  
P12: send in paperwork, and now you can do it online, and so, I mean.  
23  
00:02:16.210 \--\> 00:02:19.069  
P12: you know, I was researching on how to do that, but…  
24  
00:02:19.520 \--\> 00:02:23.009  
P12: Yeah, it's usually just logging in to the app.  
25  
00:02:24.380 \--\> 00:02:25.080  
Moderator: Got it.  
26  
00:02:26.410 \--\> 00:02:35.500  
Moderator: So, let's go ahead and get to the tool that we're gonna test. I am gonna share a link with you in the chat for this meeting.  
27  
00:02:45.380 \--\> 00:02:47.400  
Moderator: Do you see a message with a link?  
28  
00:02:47.880 \--\> 00:02:48.490  
P12: Yes.  
29  
00:02:48.490 \--\> 00:02:49.000  
Moderator: Great.  
30  
00:02:50.900 \--\> 00:02:51.590  
P12: Sitting.  
31  
00:02:53.540 \--\> 00:02:59.039  
Moderator: And, could you tell me what kind of device are you on, and what browser are you using?  
32  
00:02:59.870 \--\> 00:03:01.250  
P12: I am  
33  
00:03:05.020 \--\> 00:03:11.800  
P12: Lenovo… And I'm using Microsoft Edge.  
34  
00:03:12.770 \--\> 00:03:13.940  
P12: I believe.  
35  
00:03:14.710 \--\> 00:03:18.120  
P12: Hold on, let me confirm that. Yeah, Microsoft Edge.  
36  
00:03:19.500 \--\> 00:03:20.640  
P12: For the browser.  
37  
00:03:21.450 \--\> 00:03:22.900  
Moderator: Great, good to know.  
38  
00:03:25.670 \--\> 00:03:30.469  
Moderator: Are you, are you able to open the link?  
39  
00:03:32.240 \--\> 00:03:32.950  
P12: Yes.  
40  
00:03:33.350 \--\> 00:03:39.030  
Moderator: Great. You're gonna see a green box that says, you know, that you're entering a prototype, that's code.  
41  
00:03:39.030 \--\> 00:03:39.400  
P12: Right.  
42  
00:03:39.400 \--\> 00:03:44.070  
Moderator: That's the tool we're using. It's not going to behave exactly like VA.gov.  
43  
00:03:46.480 \--\> 00:03:50.650  
P12: Okay, so… hit the get started, the green arrow.  
44  
00:03:51.150 \--\> 00:03:54.659  
Moderator: Yes, and could you please share your screen as well?  
45  
00:03:54.660 \--\> 00:03:55.850  
P12: Oh, yeah, yeah.  
46  
00:03:58.650 \--\> 00:04:00.799  
P12: I had a feeling you were gonna ask that.  
47  
00:04:01.660 \--\> 00:04:06.160  
Moderator: Yeah. And take all the time you need if you need to minimize other stuff.  
48  
00:04:25.340 \--\> 00:04:43.320  
Moderator: Great. So looks like you started on the first page in Discover Your Benefits, and then, you hit get started. We can… we can start here. What I would like you to do for this test, I'd like you to use this exactly like you would if you're doing it on your own. The only difference is I'd like you to  
49  
00:04:43.320 \--\> 00:04:49.749  
Moderator: You know, say aloud what you're noticing, thinking, feeling, especially if anything goes wrong, especially if there's something you really like.  
50  
00:04:50.040 \--\> 00:05:01.280  
Moderator: And, you know, don't forget, this is… this is a test of the tool, this is a test of the website, this is not a test of you. And, you know, we want to know about anything that feels weird.  
51  
00:05:02.510 \--\> 00:05:03.539  
P12: Right, right.  
52  
00:05:03.740 \--\> 00:05:04.470  
P12: Okay.  
53  
00:05:05.420 \--\> 00:05:15.330  
P12: Yeah, I mean, for me, if, you know, I saw this, you know, discover your benefits, I don't need financial support, I mean, I'm 100%, I don't…  
54  
00:05:16.320 \--\> 00:05:20.809  
P12: really need to go any further. I would like to go back to school.  
55  
00:05:21.870 \--\> 00:05:23.210  
P12: I can't retire.  
56  
00:05:24.120 \--\> 00:05:32.440  
P12: Already transitioned… You know, I need to start taking better care of my health, well-being.  
57  
00:05:33.370 \--\> 00:05:35.690  
P12: Maybe understand my benefits better.  
58  
00:05:37.100 \--\> 00:05:40.120  
P12: And I mean, this one, I click it because I'm curious what…  
59  
00:05:40.230 \--\> 00:05:45.970  
P12: you know, playing for my family's future, I'm not really sure, but I, you know, I'm interested in that.  
60  
00:05:46.510 \--\> 00:05:48.950  
Moderator: What's your best guess about what it is?  
61  
00:05:50.140 \--\> 00:05:50.645  
P12: Mmm…  
62  
00:05:54.950 \--\> 00:05:56.920  
P12: I would say…  
63  
00:06:00.090 \--\> 00:06:07.610  
P12: You know, I… I don't know, I don't know, it could be anything from… How to plan for finances…  
64  
00:06:08.150 \--\> 00:06:09.810  
P12: You know, how to…  
65  
00:06:13.080 \--\> 00:06:15.979  
P12: you know, I don't know.  
66  
00:06:16.180 \--\> 00:06:21.790  
P12: How to get my family on medical or something, I'm not sure.  
67  
00:06:23.470 \--\> 00:06:26.890  
Moderator: So, finance, dependents, that kind of stuff.  
68  
00:06:28.410 \--\> 00:06:29.250  
P12: Yeah.  
69  
00:06:29.870 \--\> 00:06:30.430  
Moderator: Okay.  
70  
00:06:30.630 \--\> 00:06:31.429  
Moderator: Yeah.  
71  
00:06:31.430 \--\> 00:06:32.729  
P12: You know, maybe he'll…  
72  
00:06:33.130 \--\> 00:06:33.620  
Moderator: limits.  
73  
00:06:33.850 \--\> 00:06:36.120  
Moderator: Sorry to interrupt. Go ahead, please.  
74  
00:06:36.940 \--\> 00:06:42.990  
P12: Oh, I said, you know, however, you know, my family comes into my benefits, I'm guessing.  
75  
00:06:44.020 \--\> 00:06:44.770  
P12: So…  
76  
00:06:47.800 \--\> 00:06:54.900  
Moderator: So, when you're ready, maybe they'll benefit this list, you can go ahead and, hit continue.  
77  
00:06:58.310 \--\> 00:06:59.320  
P12: Alright.  
78  
00:07:01.710 \--\> 00:07:04.400  
P12: Yeah, there's nothing weird about this question.  
79  
00:07:05.530 \--\> 00:07:06.549  
P12: At all.  
80  
00:07:14.370 \--\> 00:07:16.520  
P12: Nothing weird about that.  
81  
00:07:17.700 \--\> 00:07:19.980  
P12: So, all the branches there.  
82  
00:07:22.590 \--\> 00:07:27.329  
P12: Same as this one, everything that I would expect in that question is there.  
83  
00:07:34.650 \--\> 00:07:35.630  
P12: See ya.  
84  
00:07:37.160 \--\> 00:07:39.469  
P12: This is straightforward.  
85  
00:07:52.900 \--\> 00:07:56.869  
P12: I mean, that's straightforward, too. You know, I guess, in my head, I'm like…  
86  
00:07:57.340 \--\> 00:08:00.450  
P12: Well, you know, there's a big difference between separating  
87  
00:08:01.750 \--\> 00:08:10.520  
P12: 3 years ago versus 10 or 20, you know, Depending on… Whatever.  
88  
00:08:10.720 \--\> 00:08:13.000  
P12: You know, there could be different benefits.  
89  
00:08:14.380 \--\> 00:08:19.969  
P12: Yeah, you know, and I know some… some benefits for some people expire after a certain time.  
90  
00:08:24.080 \--\> 00:08:26.419  
P12: So anyway, that's just my thought.  
91  
00:08:29.360 \--\> 00:08:39.030  
Moderator: So, does seeing… does seeing the way that the question is structured make you feel like…  
92  
00:08:39.419 \--\> 00:08:41.380  
Moderator: You know, make you…  
93  
00:08:41.570 \--\> 00:08:48.390  
Moderator: Change your expectations about what kind of benefits might be recommended to you, or does it, what does it make you think about?  
94  
00:08:48.670 \--\> 00:08:59.030  
P12: Well, I think more just because now it's smaller increments. The previous questions, you know, were, like, up to 20 years or whatever, and now it's lower, so it's kind of like, okay…  
95  
00:09:00.040 \--\> 00:09:08.519  
P12: does it really matter if it was a year or 3 years? You know, obviously it has 3 plus years, but then it factors, you know, because…  
96  
00:09:09.240 \--\> 00:09:15.170  
P12: I've been out for 11 years now, and, you know, stories of people who are out  
97  
00:09:15.790 \--\> 00:09:22.399  
P12: couple years before me, or 10 years, you know, things have changed in how you apply for benefits, and even since I've been out.  
98  
00:09:22.400 \--\> 00:09:23.190  
Moderator: born.  
99  
00:09:23.190 \--\> 00:09:27.380  
P12: That might be, you know… I guess in my head, if…  
100  
00:09:27.600 \--\> 00:09:34.229  
P12: I was trying to guide people, you know, there could be different questions for people that were out 10 years ago versus…  
101  
00:09:34.660 \--\> 00:09:41.000  
P12: 20 years ago or more, besides just everything grouped into 3-plus years or more.  
102  
00:09:45.640 \--\> 00:09:58.220  
Moderator: So, if we were going to do something like that, what do you think about 3 to 9 years, and then 10 plus years? Do you think that would make… would feel more inclusive, or more accurate?  
103  
00:09:58.790 \--\> 00:10:01.129  
P12: Well, or even, you know.  
104  
00:10:02.140 \--\> 00:10:08.019  
P12: 0 to 3 months, you know, I would think is good, because that's, like, ins… you know, you're fresh out.  
105  
00:10:08.130 \--\> 00:10:12.789  
P12: And then, you know, like, 3 months to a year.  
106  
00:10:13.860 \--\> 00:10:19.199  
P12: You know, then maybe 1 to 3 years, and then, yeah, like, and then the increments get bigger.  
107  
00:10:21.540 \--\> 00:10:26.859  
P12: But having 3 different options all within the last… within a single year seems kinda…  
108  
00:10:27.200 \--\> 00:10:32.690  
P12: I don't feel like that's… in my head, I'm like, that just seems… Kinda weird.  
109  
00:10:32.770 \--\> 00:10:33.720  
Moderator: Hmm.  
110  
00:10:34.400 \--\> 00:10:39.470  
P12: It's like there's… it's like there's too much, you know, it's almost like it should just be zero to one year.  
111  
00:10:40.250 \--\> 00:10:46.319  
P12: And then… You know, maybe 1 to 3 years, and maybe 3 to… 9 or whatever.  
112  
00:10:46.740 \--\> 00:10:48.860  
P12: And then, you know, maybe 10 plus and up.  
113  
00:10:50.470 \--\> 00:11:00.080  
Moderator: When you were, transitioning out of the military, was it common to do benefit application or benefit determination and separation like people do now?  
114  
00:11:01.310 \--\> 00:11:06.769  
P12: Well, I'm not sure how they do it now. I know I got out in 2014\.  
115  
00:11:06.910 \--\> 00:11:14.140  
P12: And I think… In 2012, They… the military…  
116  
00:11:15.600 \--\> 00:11:25.010  
P12: changed how, like, transitioning out. So you had to go through a class about… Applying for benefits, you know…  
117  
00:11:25.470 \--\> 00:11:32.349  
P12: And, starting your VA… claims before you even got out, which is what I did.  
118  
00:11:33.190 \--\> 00:11:36.070  
P12: So, like, I started doing my packet  
119  
00:11:36.280 \--\> 00:11:41.239  
P12: you know, 6 months before I got out, for… my VA claims.  
120  
00:11:43.300 \--\> 00:11:51.159  
P12: And that was kind of part of your transition process, that you, you know, you had to at least go through the classes and learn.  
121  
00:11:51.470 \--\> 00:11:55.780  
P12: that you could do it. You weren't forced to do VA claims, but…  
122  
00:11:56.570 \--\> 00:12:03.780  
P12: you learned a lot more, and I'm like, hey, I could start this now, you know, and hear from others how, you know.  
123  
00:12:03.970 \--\> 00:12:08.879  
P12: Could take years, and… I mean, that was really helpful.  
124  
00:12:10.120 \--\> 00:12:14.590  
P12: And those were called the TAP classes, Transition Assistance…  
125  
00:12:15.540 \--\> 00:12:17.310  
P12: program, I believe.  
126  
00:12:18.130 \--\> 00:12:20.650  
P12: Or transition something,  
127  
00:12:22.250 \--\> 00:12:26.550  
P12: So yeah, that was… that was very helpful, but when I got out, I didn't, you know, I used…  
128  
00:12:26.710 \--\> 00:12:32.080  
P12: I think the American Legion on post… at Fort Lewis.  
129  
00:12:33.360 \--\> 00:12:42.109  
P12: Or one of the similar… Groups there, and they helped me… Go through my medical records.  
130  
00:12:42.660 \--\> 00:12:47.170  
P12: you know, what… And kind of get all that stuff together.  
131  
00:12:47.650 \--\> 00:12:50.720  
P12: And they applied for me.  
132  
00:12:50.930 \--\> 00:12:53.790  
P12: You know, as my service representative.  
133  
00:12:56.500 \--\> 00:13:01.970  
P12: And then when I got out, you know, I had…  
134  
00:13:02.590 \--\> 00:13:04.870  
P12: A couple things that were, like, instant.  
135  
00:13:06.140 \--\> 00:13:13.320  
P12: But I still… it still took me 2 years to get everything… Acknowledged.  
136  
00:13:13.590 \--\> 00:13:19.320  
P12: And I had to do… A lot of that… Almost on my own.  
137  
00:13:19.940 \--\> 00:13:22.440  
P12: Help from… from peers.  
138  
00:13:23.170 \--\> 00:13:29.209  
P12: You know, I had a VSO through the county, Which was really helpful.  
139  
00:13:30.710 \--\> 00:13:37.869  
P12: But they were just so busy, had so many, you know, it was like, I wasn't getting the help that I needed, and I'm pretty thorough.  
140  
00:13:38.780 \--\> 00:13:46.859  
P12: You know, just hearing stories from other veterans… And people, you know, I… I basically…  
141  
00:13:47.430 \--\> 00:13:50.970  
P12: You know, went through all my medical records myself again.  
142  
00:13:51.780 \--\> 00:13:54.700  
P12: And, you know, one of… somebody…  
143  
00:13:55.040 \--\> 00:13:57.559  
P12: showed me the link to see…  
144  
00:13:57.920 \--\> 00:14:02.020  
P12: It's basically a link, you know, like an index of every…  
145  
00:14:02.270 \--\> 00:14:06.479  
P12: Code for every kind of service-connected disability.  
146  
00:14:07.680 \--\> 00:14:12.160  
P12: And what I would… and what you could do in that is…  
147  
00:14:12.930 \--\> 00:14:17.609  
P12: You go through your medical records, say, hey, I was diagnosed with this, I had these problems.  
148  
00:14:18.450 \--\> 00:14:22.620  
P12: And on this website, you would go to, like, okay…  
149  
00:14:24.600 \--\> 00:14:30.170  
P12: you know, stomach problems are, like, your right hand. You know, let's say I injured my right hand.  
150  
00:14:31.010 \--\> 00:14:33.300  
P12: You go to the… the hands…  
151  
00:14:33.980 \--\> 00:14:37.550  
P12: Hands and feet section, and then you can kind of, like.  
152  
00:14:38.070 \--\> 00:14:43.720  
P12: Say, okay, here's all the different codes for… Connectable…  
153  
00:14:43.850 \--\> 00:14:53.549  
P12: codes for different conditions for your hands, you know, and what happened, and I was able to say, okay, well, these are in my records, this is what I can prove, this is the code that…  
154  
00:14:54.050 \--\> 00:14:56.830  
P12: I need to submit to the VA so they don't…  
155  
00:14:57.350 \--\> 00:14:59.560  
P12: Have to look for it themselves, right?  
156  
00:15:00.510 \--\> 00:15:06.350  
P12: if my records matched it, and those were the issues I was having, and…  
157  
00:15:06.940 \--\> 00:15:12.600  
P12: you know, I basically got everything I… Submitted for.  
158  
00:15:13.060 \--\> 00:15:14.020  
P12: Eventually.  
159  
00:15:14.470 \--\> 00:15:14.899  
Moderator: Good food.  
160  
00:15:14.900 \--\> 00:15:15.790  
P12: Hmm.  
161  
00:15:17.840 \--\> 00:15:20.120  
P12: So I was just… I was more on top of it.  
162  
00:15:20.460 \--\> 00:15:28.550  
P12: then… what I was, you know, I know there's some great VSOs out there, but…  
163  
00:15:29.500 \--\> 00:15:34.869  
P12: I've… yeah. Anyway, that was kind of my… my process.  
164  
00:15:35.790 \--\> 00:15:40.819  
Moderator: Yeah, thank you for sharing that. It's really helpful to know what that was like.  
165  
00:15:45.250 \--\> 00:15:50.489  
Moderator: So, if you could hit continue, and we'll go on to the next section of this form.  
166  
00:15:53.010 \--\> 00:15:53.830  
P12: \-  
167  
00:16:01.800 \--\> 00:16:08.010  
P12: Yeah, I mean, that's… this is… Straightforward.  
168  
00:16:08.890 \--\> 00:16:11.609  
P12: All the different discharge types.  
169  
00:16:17.970 \--\> 00:16:18.930  
P12: I guess.  
170  
00:16:19.960 \--\> 00:16:26.809  
P12: Okay… I guess where I'm thinking, I'm like, highest, you know, when I read highest, and before, I'm like…  
171  
00:16:27.070 \--\> 00:16:32.120  
P12: Is there a ranking structure? Which, I mean, I guess there is, you know,  
172  
00:16:35.240 \--\> 00:16:39.110  
P12: I think just highest, you know, seems kind of like, okay…  
173  
00:16:39.510 \--\> 00:16:43.650  
P12: what the heck does that mean? But, you know, then I look at it, and I was like, okay, well, that is…  
174  
00:16:46.140 \--\> 00:16:47.610  
P12: That is kind of…  
175  
00:16:51.320 \--\> 00:16:55.309  
P12: I guess there's… I mean, honorable's the highest you can get. There's… you can't…  
176  
00:16:56.490 \--\> 00:16:57.630  
P12: That's the highest.  
177  
00:16:58.040 \--\> 00:17:07.430  
Moderator: Yeah, so there's the text right underneath what it… where it says that, that explains why it might say highest. Is that…  
178  
00:17:07.660 \--\> 00:17:12.209  
Moderator: Right. Or should… or… or should we, change that?  
179  
00:17:15.450 \--\> 00:17:17.449  
P12: No, that's… no, that's pretty clear.  
180  
00:17:18.990 \--\> 00:17:21.670  
P12: You know, and then I see this, although…  
181  
00:17:22.470 \--\> 00:17:27.080  
P12: I didn't really quite see this, just because it's a different color, to learn more.  
182  
00:17:28.400 \--\> 00:17:33.509  
P12: You know, I kind of skipped over it, smaller techs.  
183  
00:17:34.580 \--\> 00:17:36.050  
P12: Kind of a weird color.  
184  
00:17:37.100 \--\> 00:17:43.480  
P12: You know, in my opinion, it would be better to have this above the drop-down box.  
185  
00:17:44.290 \--\> 00:17:48.900  
P12: Or… even…  
186  
00:17:49.200 \--\> 00:17:59.130  
P12: you know, that section, if you feel your character of discharge and just, you know, because, like, I only read the first sentence. I was like, okay, I know what I do, I gotta click this box.  
187  
00:18:00.110 \--\> 00:18:06.809  
P12: You know, I read… I didn't even read the second sentence, to be honest. I just naturally skipped over it, because I was like, okay.  
188  
00:18:07.660 \--\> 00:18:13.330  
P12: my discharge, here it is, you know, and I would have hit continue, and Missed it.  
189  
00:18:16.980 \--\> 00:18:17.570  
Moderator: Good insight.  
190  
00:18:17.570 \--\> 00:18:22.970  
P12: You know, maybe… I don't know, change how it's laid out.  
191  
00:18:25.550 \--\> 00:18:27.529  
P12: So people can see it.  
192  
00:18:28.940 \--\> 00:18:31.939  
P12: Or, you know, they don't skip over. I'm not really sure.  
193  
00:18:32.550 \--\> 00:18:34.029  
P12: How you do that.  
194  
00:18:38.400 \--\> 00:18:40.410  
P12: But yeah, I skipped over both of them.  
195  
00:18:42.150 \--\> 00:18:43.559  
Moderator: And which is totally fine.  
196  
00:18:45.890 \--\> 00:18:48.600  
P12: So… Excuse me.  
197  
00:18:50.480 \--\> 00:18:53.500  
P12: So, this one, disability rating…  
198  
00:19:01.860 \--\> 00:19:02.750  
P12: Okay.  
199  
00:19:06.340 \--\> 00:19:11.960  
P12: So, like, with this one, you know, for me, like, I filed, I received some ratings right away.  
200  
00:19:13.470 \--\> 00:19:16.490  
P12: Some needed more information.  
201  
00:19:19.080 \--\> 00:19:23.080  
P12: So, like, I guess, you know, I guess one of the questions that could be missing is…  
202  
00:19:23.570 \--\> 00:19:28.780  
P12: I filed a disability claim… Some received a rating, some…  
203  
00:19:29.170 \--\> 00:19:31.879  
P12: were denied. You know, like, if you had both, right?  
204  
00:19:35.910 \--\> 00:19:44.589  
Moderator: That's… that's a really good insight. So it might not be clear if, you know, you're in the process of the supplemental claim, is that what you're saying?  
205  
00:19:45.260 \--\> 00:19:46.849  
P12: Right, well, like, you know, like…  
206  
00:19:47.160 \--\> 00:19:54.120  
P12: Sure, I filed a disability claim and I received a rating, but I also filed a disability claim and haven't received a rating.  
207  
00:19:56.050 \--\> 00:20:02.810  
P12: You know, so it could be either or, I guess it just depends on… You know, there's… There's no…  
208  
00:20:04.010 \--\> 00:20:07.979  
P12: They're both right answers, but you can't… you can only click one, right?  
209  
00:20:08.650 \--\> 00:20:09.020  
Moderator: Yep.  
210  
00:20:11.780 \--\> 00:20:13.800  
P12: So that's all I have for that.  
211  
00:20:15.530 \--\> 00:20:21.640  
P12: Review… oh, okay.  
212  
00:20:32.470 \--\> 00:20:34.399  
P12: Okay, I see what it's doing there.  
213  
00:20:38.860 \--\> 00:20:43.320  
P12: I guess for this, it was kind of weird, I was like, okay, review, what is it telling me to do?  
214  
00:20:44.060 \--\> 00:20:50.149  
P12: You know, the privacy policy, Okay, I gotta… You know, click that…  
215  
00:20:54.300 \--\> 00:20:57.480  
P12: Oh, it's not… nothing loaded for me, but…  
216  
00:21:00.090 \--\> 00:21:10.780  
P12: you know, usually when I read this, okay, checkmark, I mean, every… I mean, I've, you know, over my lifetime, hundreds of these where, you know, you usually gotta click on that other link.  
217  
00:21:11.110 \--\> 00:21:14.720  
P12: That's straightforward, I guess, up here, top, where, you know.  
218  
00:21:15.180 \--\> 00:21:20.399  
P12: Well, we went over, the plus sign. Might be good to have, like, some texting.  
219  
00:21:21.120 \--\> 00:21:24.429  
P12: You know, in these boxes, you can review…

Moderator: I noticed that you are filtering right away. Can you tell me about that decision?  
232  
00:23:03.130 \--\> 00:23:08.389  
P12: Well, there's… I mean, there's 15 things on there.  
233  
00:23:09.040 \--\> 00:23:14.709  
P12: You know, even though it doesn't seem like a lot, it was…  
234  
00:23:17.670 \--\> 00:23:22.460  
P12: I don't know, just, you know, when I f- because I first started scrolling down slightly to just see…  
235

P12: I don't know, some of the stuff at the top, I wasn't… didn't really need, and it was kinda…  
237  
00:23:37.550 \--\> 00:23:42.460  
P12: I tend to… filter things…  
238  
00:23:43.590 \--\> 00:23:50.479  
P12: Right away, especially if, you know, I'm looking for specific things. You know, I saw, like, on the side, okay.  
239  
00:23:51.170 \--\> 00:23:56.150  
P12: Well, before separation, that doesn't apply to me. Let's get rid of this stuff.  
240  
00:23:57.370 \--\> 00:24:00.190  
P12: That is for that, doesn't… Apply.  
241  
00:24:00.880 \--\> 00:24:06.940  
P12: You know, I saw after, so I knew that would, you know, filter down.  
242  
00:24:08.200 \--\> 00:24:10.459  
P12: Mmm… And then, you know, I'd…  
243  
00:24:11.490 \--\> 00:24:16.420  
P12: Because this filter section was easy, okay? Here's some of the different topics that came up.  
244  
00:24:17.130 \--\> 00:24:23.420  
P12: with what… You know, the previous questions… Compiled.  
245  
00:24:24.400 \--\> 00:24:31.309  
P12: Then, you know, here, it's, like, a little bit more, you know, the topics of… what came up?  
246  
00:24:31.920 \--\> 00:24:37.289  
P12: And the ones, you know, I'd maybe look at, you know, interested in looking at right now, or not.  
247  
00:24:38.400 \--\> 00:24:41.810  
P12: That's pretty straightforward.  
248  
00:24:44.040 \--\> 00:24:47.800  
P12: And, yeah, I just… I personally tend to…  
249  
00:24:48.900 \--\> 00:24:53.219  
P12: go straight to the filters when I'm on things like, you know, doing something like this.  
250  
00:24:54.700 \--\> 00:25:01.150  
P12: You know, it's kind of like Google. It's like, you Google something, but you don't see what you're looking for right away at the top.  
251  
00:25:02.060 \--\> 00:25:04.199  
P12: Okay, well, let's refine the search.  
252  
00:25:04.350 \--\> 00:25:10.469  
P12: You know… And going to… I mean, I have gone to college, I have used my GI Bill.  
253  
00:25:10.870 \--\> 00:25:18.810  
P12: You know, looking up… Sources, you know, library sources, it's like, you're gonna get…  
254  
00:25:19.790 \--\> 00:25:22.470  
P12: It's best to just refine as, you know…  
255  
00:25:23.380 \--\> 00:25:30.129  
P12: As much as you can, and if you don't find it, you know, reduce… Your filters, or increase them.  
256  
00:25:33.520 \--\> 00:25:43.769  
Moderator: When you first got on this page and started looking at it, what was your assumption about why the benefits that are being shown to you are being shown to you?  
257  
00:25:45.240 \--\> 00:25:47.159  
P12: Well, I mean, based off…  
258  
00:25:47.560 \--\> 00:25:49.589  
P12: You know, I just did that questionnaire.  
259  
00:25:50.670 \--\> 00:25:58.380  
P12: So I assume that's, you know, based off, you know, my questions in that, kind of filtered… pre-filtered.  
260  
00:25:58.560 \--\> 00:25:59.610  
P12: horns.  
261  
00:26:01.260 \--\> 00:26:04.859  
P12: what I'm seeing now, before I did these filters on this page.  
262  
00:26:05.110 \--\> 00:26:05.540  
Moderator: Hmm.  
263  
00:26:05.540 \--\> 00:26:07.429  
P12: I kind of assumed that.  
264  
00:26:12.480 \--\> 00:26:13.330  
P12: Yeah.  
265  
00:26:15.420 \--\> 00:26:16.590  
P12: Can you…  
266  
00:26:17.090 \--\> 00:26:20.099  
Moderator: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Please, go ahead.  
267  
00:26:20.700 \--\> 00:26:24.770  
P12: But one thing that comes up to mind, you know, when I saw this.  
268  
00:26:25.270 \--\> 00:26:29.249  
P12: Each… each thing that… each result that popped up  
269  
00:26:30.420 \--\> 00:26:33.779  
P12: There's all this extra room on the side of the page…  
270  
00:26:33.910 \--\> 00:26:38.320  
P12: And I can only see one at a time with at least how my screen zoom is.  
271  
00:26:39.890 \--\> 00:26:43.219  
P12: You know, I don't know if this is…  
272  
00:26:43.480 \--\> 00:26:51.220  
P12: kind of set up for phones, where you got the narrow screen, but… it's so wide, I can only see, like, one or two at a time, versus…  
273  
00:26:52.370 \--\> 00:27:00.670  
P12: you know, if you're on, you know, on, like, Google searching, it's usually a skinnier, narrow row…  
274  
00:27:01.330 \--\> 00:27:04.729  
P12: Where you can see a bunch a lot quicker, right?  
275  
00:27:09.360 \--\> 00:27:18.940  
P12: instead of, you know, having to scroll down just to see a couple more, you know, you can see a lot. In my opinion, you know, you'd be able to see a lot more. It looks like this page is fixed.  
276  
00:27:19.750 \--\> 00:27:25.230  
P12: You know, like, if I… zoom in and out, it doesn't adjust, right?  
277  
00:27:26.940 \--\> 00:27:33.199  
P12: You know, typically, you know, when you do this, in my experience on other search  
278  
00:27:33.830 \--\> 00:27:38.939  
P12: you know, filter engines. You know, the filters would be kind of fixed off to the left.  
279  
00:27:41.130 \--\> 00:27:44.979  
P12: And then, which I guess is kind of…  
280  
00:27:45.200 \--\> 00:27:50.240  
P12: Yeah, it doesn't, so the filters are fixed. You know, it's all part of the same…  
281  
00:27:52.020 \--\> 00:28:00.549  
P12: page, but, you know, in other sites, the filters will always stay on the left, even when you scroll down, so if you're way down here and you need to change it.  
282  
00:28:00.660 \--\> 00:28:02.550  
P12: Now you gotta go all the way back up.  
283  
00:28:05.460 \--\> 00:28:12.740  
P12: Which is, you know, just… Being used to other sites being like that, you know, now it's an inconvenience.  
284  
00:28:14.260 \--\> 00:28:16.239  
Moderator: Yeah, I can definitely see that.  
285  
00:28:17.530 \--\> 00:28:22.129  
P12: You know, we're just lacking, like, okay, well, everybody else does it, you know.  
286  
00:28:22.780 \--\> 00:28:25.340  
P12: Why… how hard is it for…  
287  
00:28:25.970 \--\> 00:28:28.279  
P12: To be like that on here, you know?  
288  
00:28:30.110 \--\> 00:28:31.190  
P12: When you're…  
289  
00:28:31.190 \--\> 00:28:36.699  
Moderator: When you're looking at the different benefits, what's jumping out to you? Where are your eyes going first?  
290  
00:28:40.790 \--\> 00:28:48.140  
P12: Well, I mean, the… the bigger, boldest letter, like, on the top, you know, the GI Bill benefits.  
291  
00:28:49.460 \--\> 00:28:53.969  
P12: But really, what jumps out to me is the ugly square boxes they're in.  
292  
00:28:59.960 \--\> 00:29:02.939  
Moderator: So you're not… you're not a fan of the… of the card format?  
293  
00:29:03.570 \--\> 00:29:05.439  
P12: No. Not at all.  
294  
00:29:12.720 \--\> 00:29:20.330  
Moderator: What do you like more than the card? Like, in a perfect world, how would this information be displayed to you?  
295  
00:29:26.610 \--\> 00:29:31.739  
P12: Well, I mean, like I was saying, you know, for me, I feel like it would have been better…  
296  
00:29:32.880 \--\> 00:29:39.079  
P12: having longer… You know, row-like instead of blocks.  
297  
00:29:39.900 \--\> 00:29:42.049  
P12: You know, these squares that are popping up.  
298  
00:29:44.470 \--\> 00:29:49.420  
P12: You know, and depending on how your Zoom is set on your page, right, all of a sudden.  
299  
00:29:49.810 \--\> 00:29:55.150  
P12: You know, these, for some people, it could be, like, You know, be like that.  
300  
00:29:56.630 \--\> 00:29:59.679  
P12: Super big. Or super small.  
301  
00:30:00.800 \--\> 00:30:08.110  
P12: You know, I tend to like the pages where it auto… formats.  
302  
00:30:09.440 \--\> 00:30:10.860  
P12: You know.  
303  
00:30:11.140 \--\> 00:30:15.019  
Moderator: Where it's responsive to the settings that you have on your browser, where it…  
304  
00:30:15.200 \--\> 00:30:15.690  
P12: Right.  
305  
00:30:15.690 \--\> 00:30:20.699  
Moderator: looks the way you're expecting all of your other tabs to look. Is that what you're saying?  
306  
00:30:20.700 \--\> 00:30:22.090  
P12: Yeah, yeah.  
307  
00:30:24.570 \--\> 00:30:28.060  
P12: Well, and you know, some older people, they don't even know how to… I mean, no…  
308  
00:30:28.350 \--\> 00:30:40.940  
P12: They don't know how to zoom in and out like this, you know, it's… Anyway, that's… I guess…  
309  
00:30:41.330 \--\> 00:30:43.910  
P12: Yeah, I guess that's all I have for that right now.  
310  
00:30:44.060 \--\> 00:30:44.460  
Moderator: Agreed.  
311  
00:30:44.840 \--\> 00:30:46.569  
P12: Unless you have questions.  
312  
00:30:47.110 \--\> 00:30:52.429  
Moderator: Yeah, so follow-up question is… when…  
313  
00:30:52.580 \--\> 00:30:58.910  
Moderator: you're looking at the benefits, you know, you were saying that your assumption is that,  
314  
00:30:59.180 \--\> 00:31:08.060  
Moderator: the ones that are displayed is because of the questionnaire answers. What is your assumption about the order that they're displayed in?  
315  
00:31:12.070 \--\> 00:31:16.370  
P12: I mean, usually, you know, my assumption is  
316  
00:31:16.930 \--\> 00:31:21.130  
P12: Based off these things in the past, or… what…  
317  
00:31:21.880 \--\> 00:31:25.290  
P12: Have been clicked on the most by previous users.  
318  
00:31:26.640 \--\> 00:31:35.959  
P12: And then… Yeah, that's… that would be my assumption. What… what has been used the most?  
319  
00:31:36.880 \--\> 00:31:42.949  
P12: Based off my filters and my… Answers to the previous questions.  
320  
00:31:44.740 \--\> 00:31:48.630  
Moderator: Can you find a way to get that information on the page?  
321  
00:31:50.030 \--\> 00:31:50.900  
P12: What's that?  
322  
00:31:50.900 \--\> 00:32:00.539  
Moderator: Could you look… there is a way to find that information out and change it on the page? I'd like you to see if you can find it.  
323  
00:32:06.520 \--\> 00:32:09.120  
P12: Oh, okay, recommended for you.  
324  
00:32:10.680 \--\> 00:32:12.350  
P12: versus all results.  
325  
00:32:13.140 \--\> 00:32:14.700  
P12: Is that what you're talking about?  
326  
00:32:15.920 \--\> 00:32:29.860  
Moderator: Actually, no, but now that… now that you're… now that you're there, let's take a look at that. So, when you see recommended for you versus all results, are all results something you're interested in seeing?  
327  
00:32:30.170 \--\> 00:32:31.110  
P12: No.  
328  
00:32:31.390 \--\> 00:32:34.539  
P12: But I do see the, you know, the sort thing now.  
329  
00:32:36.390 \--\> 00:32:44.589  
P12: I don't really get why expiration date has… Is even up there.  
330  
00:32:44.860 \--\> 00:32:51.960  
P12: That doesn't make sense, like… How would any, you know, additional information expire, right?  
331  
00:32:52.510 \--\> 00:32:55.389  
P12: Like, what is, what is… what is, you know…  
332  
00:32:55.900 \--\> 00:33:01.439  
P12: Because then you look at these cards, and there's, like, there's… nothing says anything about expiring, what does that even mean?  
333  
00:33:01.770 \--\> 00:33:04.050  
P12: Why is that even an option for sort?  
334  
00:33:05.550 \--\> 00:33:25.040  
Moderator: You know, what you're surfacing here is something that we need to figure out, where we need to make it clear for people who are early in the transition process, that some benefits are time-sensitive and do expire, but for people like you, who, have been out for a while.  
335  
00:33:25.260 \--\> 00:33:37.460  
Moderator: None of the benefits are expiring, so we need to figure out a better way to make that clear why it says expiration date, because that's something that matters to people who are, you know, in their first year, or even 3 years after separating.  
336  
00:33:37.460 \--\> 00:33:37.859  
P12: Thank you.  
337  
00:33:37.860 \--\> 00:33:46.390  
Moderator: military, but it sounds like it's not clear to you and some other people who have tested this who have been out for a while.  
338  
00:33:47.060 \--\> 00:33:48.219  
P12: Right, okay.  
339  
00:33:50.800 \--\> 00:33:56.060  
P12: The other thing is, you know, when I go to A to Z, for me…  
340  
00:33:56.950 \--\> 00:34:03.780  
P12: You know, it's… it's like… because you got different… you got, like, healthcare, education, as… Kind of the…  
341  
00:34:04.190 \--\> 00:34:12.499  
P12: the grouping… But even then… you know, I…  
342  
00:34:12.850 \--\> 00:34:17.750  
P12: It's like… I was assuming, because when I… let's see, let's go back to expiration.  
343  
00:34:19.400 \--\> 00:34:22.460  
P12: you know, here, I was like, oh, gee, I bill benefits.  
344  
00:34:23.130 \--\> 00:34:25.770  
P12: And then VR\&E was down here.  
345  
00:34:26.400 \--\> 00:34:29.309  
P12: But that's also technically education.  
346  
00:34:29.820 \--\> 00:34:40.799  
P12: I'm like, why aren't those two together, right? I… a lot of people, in my opinion, miss out on VR\&E because they look up education, all they get is GI Bill benefits, you know?  
347  
00:34:41.219 \--\> 00:34:43.679  
P12: I've heard this over and over, it's like.  
348  
00:34:45.210 \--\> 00:34:47.580  
P12: You know, you should be learning about both of them.  
349  
00:34:48.239 \--\> 00:34:55.549  
P12: Because really, now that I've been out, and myself, and heard from stories, it's…  
350  
00:34:55.790 \--\> 00:35:01.870  
P12: a whole lot better for people to use VR\&E before they waste out their GI Bill benefits.  
351  
00:35:02.120 \--\> 00:35:03.379  
P12: A lot of people don't.  
352  
00:35:03.710 \--\> 00:35:06.870  
P12: Know that. I mean, as long as they qualify for it.  
353  
00:35:06.990 \--\> 00:35:07.660  
P12: But…  
354  
00:35:12.640 \--\> 00:35:19.249  
P12: Yeah, so then it was like, okay, you know, I sorted by alphabetical, and I was thinking it would be more by the topics, not by…  
355  
00:35:19.620 \--\> 00:35:23.309  
P12: what the second… you know, I was basing it off the top.  
356  
00:35:24.260 \--\> 00:35:24.990  
P12: For me, at least.

00:35:24.990 \--\> 00:35:37.430  
Moderator: Alphabetical by category, not alphabetical by title of the benefit. So, all the health cares. Like, E for education, all the education, H for healthcare, all the healthcare. Is that what you're saying?  
358  
00:35:37.660 \--\> 00:35:39.120  
P12: Right. Yeah.  
359  
00:35:40.890 \--\> 00:35:42.889  
P12: But then if I, if, if it…  
360  
00:35:43.050 \--\> 00:35:44.180  
Moderator: sorted…  
361  
00:35:44.200 \--\> 00:35:49.460  
P12: versus the subject, you know, like healthcare versus education, I would expect  
362  
00:35:49.870 \--\> 00:35:52.030  
P12: It to be in alphabetical order.  
363  
00:35:52.960 \--\> 00:35:58.680  
P12: With the second, you know, foreign medical program versus something that was started with a different letter.  
364  
00:36:00.750 \--\> 00:36:01.910  
Moderator: That's a great insight.  
365  
00:36:04.030 \--\> 00:36:12.059  
Moderator: I have one more question about the recommended for you versus all results. So, when you were looking at filters, did you see that right away?  
366  
00:36:12.710 \--\> 00:36:13.590  
P12: I did not.  
367  
00:36:13.590 \--\> 00:36:14.670  
Moderator: Okay.  
368  
00:36:16.130 \--\> 00:36:20.299  
P12: If I did, I subconsciously saw all results, and I didn't…  
369  
00:36:20.430 \--\> 00:36:23.869  
P12: I already knew I was gonna refine, I didn't want to see all results.  
370  
00:36:24.260 \--\> 00:36:25.200  
Moderator: Great.  
371  
00:36:27.490 \--\> 00:36:29.859  
P12: So, I think I may have seen it, but…  
372  
00:36:30.190 \--\> 00:36:33.300  
P12: I knew I was gonna refine anyway,  
373  
00:36:35.540 \--\> 00:36:43.040  
P12: But it's like here, once I refined anyway, it was… There's nothing changed… well… It might…  
374  
00:36:47.260 \--\> 00:36:49.950  
P12: Oh yeah, so I did get more when I did that.  
375  
00:36:54.510 \--\> 00:36:57.380  
P12: But now my assumption is, is…  
376  
00:36:58.630 \--\> 00:37:01.610  
P12: Is all results if I were to click everything?  
377  
00:37:04.500 \--\> 00:37:09.040  
P12: You know, and like, I… You know, I'm just curious now, but…  
378  
00:37:12.220 \--\> 00:37:12.600  
Moderator: It's like…  
379  
00:37:12.600 \--\> 00:37:14.610  
P12: Like, why is… well, you know…  
380  
00:37:14.840 \--\> 00:37:19.290  
P12: Why is it… now it's way more, but… .  
381  
00:37:23.040 \--\> 00:37:33.380  
Moderator: So the way it's organized is the benefits that are recommended for you via your answers to the questioner versus ones that don't  
382  
00:37:33.540 \--\> 00:37:38.980  
Moderator: aren't recommended, and then the benefit type is independent of that, but…  
383  
00:37:39.170 \--\> 00:37:41.359  
Moderator: Sounds like that is not clear.  
384  
00:37:42.120 \--\> 00:37:42.740  
P12: Right.  
385  
00:37:43.550 \--\> 00:37:45.470  
Moderator: You know, which is… that's our fault.  
386  
00:37:49.420 \--\> 00:37:50.080  
P12: Okay.  
387  
00:37:50.900 \--\> 00:37:56.560  
Moderator: So do you have any other feedback or anything else about this page?  
388  
00:37:57.660 \--\> 00:38:01.890  
P12: Yeah, I mean, I guess it's just… You know, like…  
389  
00:38:02.810 \--\> 00:38:07.570  
P12: In other search engines, you know, sometimes when you have different Check part.  
390  
00:38:08.550 \--\> 00:38:14.490  
P12: boxes, like, when I was clicking this circle, I was assuming it to just automatically apply.  
391  
00:38:14.490 \--\> 00:38:16.700  
Moderator: Instead of having to go all the way down.  
392  
00:38:17.390 \--\> 00:38:20.720  
P12: you know, for stuff like this, you know, I'm used to, okay, well, that's…  
393  
00:38:20.830 \--\> 00:38:25.810  
P12: don't automatically apply it until I'm done doing all of them, but since this is an either-or.  
394  
00:38:27.560 \--\> 00:38:29.720  
P12: Doesn't really matter, right?  
395  
00:38:32.440 \--\> 00:38:35.260  
P12: you know, if I already had checkmarks down here, it's like…  
396  
00:38:35.500 \--\> 00:38:38.369  
P12: Okay, we'll click that and just populate already.  
397  
00:38:38.960 \--\> 00:38:52.339  
Moderator: Yeah, so the checkbox is you have to hit apply, the radio button that's either or, that… your expectation is that that takes… that goes right away, that you don't have to hit apply.  
398  
00:38:52.340 \--\> 00:38:54.190  
P12: Right, that's… yeah, that's…  
399  
00:38:54.560 \--\> 00:38:58.130  
P12: You know, I was expecting that. That's why I was like, oh, wait, I gotta hit apply.  
400  
00:39:00.240 \--\> 00:39:01.789  
Moderator: Yeah, that's good to know.  
401  
00:39:02.870 \--\> 00:39:09.259  
Moderator: So I have a couple of follow-up questions now that you've gone through the tool, now that you've shared your feedback.  
402  
00:39:09.540 \--\> 00:39:16.010  
Moderator: And the first is, is this something that's helpful for you in your life today?  
403  
00:39:17.000 \--\> 00:39:18.899  
P12: Yeah, I mean, if this…  
404  
00:39:19.220 \--\> 00:39:25.480  
P12: You know, if this was on there… Yeah, I would definitely… Look into it.  
405  
00:39:28.760 \--\> 00:39:32.010  
P12: You know, it looks like a regular VA page, I'm used to that.  
406  
00:39:33.990 \--\> 00:39:38.519  
P12: you know, I have the VAgov app now, so I've been using it a lot more.  
407  
00:39:41.170 \--\> 00:39:42.670  
P12: Yeah, I probably…  
408  
00:39:43.020 \--\> 00:39:49.310  
P12: I mean, I'd probably still use it. I mean, now I know how to use it, and I see what it looks like, I wouldn't be surprised.  
409  
00:39:50.090 \--\> 00:39:53.819  
P12: you know, if the same exact thing was actually on the VA site.  
410  
00:39:56.420 \--\> 00:40:03.380  
Moderator: There's something similar, I can share the link with you for it as well. Are you finding any benefits that you didn't already know about?  
411  
00:40:05.520 \--\> 00:40:11.670  
P12: No, I mean, like, I know about disability housing grants.  
412  
00:40:12.900 \--\> 00:40:17.780  
P12: I mean, I've done a lot of research on my own over the last 10 years, and I've…  
413  
00:40:18.030 \--\> 00:40:20.789  
P12: heard, you know, I think it's good there's…  
414  
00:40:20.950 \--\> 00:40:24.499  
P12: You know, each state has different veterans' benefits.  
415  
00:40:25.130 \--\> 00:40:29.110  
P12: Which I may look into, you know, things change as well.  
416  
00:40:41.720 \--\> 00:40:49.370  
Moderator: If you were gonna give this a rating, your experience, your satisfaction with this from 1 to 5, 1's the worst, 5's the best, what would you give it?  
417  
00:40:52.100 \--\> 00:40:56.010  
P12: Oh, gosh. I mean, it's not great.  
418  
00:40:59.050 \--\> 00:41:02.189  
P12: At least for me, it's… it just seems…  
419  
00:41:02.470 \--\> 00:41:06.540  
P12: I mean, it seems like the typical VA… wordage and…  
420  
00:41:07.940 \--\> 00:41:11.550  
P12: You know, format style, which isn't the best.  
421  
00:41:13.110 \--\> 00:41:15.990  
P12: I couldn't… I couldn't give it a 5\.  
422  
00:41:16.300 \--\> 00:41:18.480  
P12: I wouldn't say it's a 4, I would say it's a 3\.  
423  
00:41:20.030 \--\> 00:41:30.110  
Moderator: what could… well, you've already… you've given some feedback about what could make it better, but, like, what is it about the VA wording and style that…  
424  
00:41:30.780 \--\> 00:41:32.249  
Moderator: That you're not…  
425  
00:41:32.250 \--\> 00:41:35.520  
P12: Well, it's just the fonts and, you know…  
426  
00:41:36.120 \--\> 00:41:45.090  
P12: You know, it's like on here, there's… 3 different fonts, there's… 3 different… font sizes…  
427  
00:41:45.870 \--\> 00:41:50.479  
P12: You know, 1, 2… Three, you know, different…  
428  
00:41:51.260 \--\> 00:41:53.620  
P12: You know, and then the… I mean, it's…  
429  
00:41:54.680 \--\> 00:41:58.890  
P12: I mean, it's just typical. It's not, like, it's necessarily a bad thing.  
430  
00:42:00.040 \--\> 00:42:04.320  
P12: But, you know, you go on Google, or…  
431  
00:42:04.920 \--\> 00:42:10.210  
P12: Bing or whatever, and they really know how to, like, make things pop out for what you're looking for, right?  
432  
00:42:13.500 \--\> 00:42:21.659  
P12: You know, and the other thing is that there's no search bar to be like, hey, you know, like, say there's still a ton, it's like, what if I'm looking for something exactly?  
433  
00:42:22.350 \--\> 00:42:31.450  
P12: there's no search bar to say, hey, I just want disability, or… especially since the sorting is kind of just A to Z, and then that expiration.  
434  
00:42:36.560 \--\> 00:42:43.749  
Moderator: You would rather search for… search for terms, versus the filters on the left?  
435  
00:42:44.510 \--\> 00:42:49.949  
P12: Well, it's… if I was specifically new to what I was trying to look for, and I was using this tool.  
436  
00:42:50.480 \--\> 00:42:57.699  
P12: Or if a word, you know, something pops up in my head, I'm like, well, what about that? Which one is that even, you know, where can I find that?  
437  
00:43:00.100 \--\> 00:43:05.380  
P12: what filters would I have to click to get to it, you know? If… if I was on all results.  
438  
00:43:07.230 \--\> 00:43:11.039  
P12: you know, maybe click it, but let's say I only did disability, and there's, like.  
439  
00:43:11.670 \--\> 00:43:13.999  
P12: 30 in there, it's like, you know…  
440  
00:43:14.390 \--\> 00:43:16.999  
P12: if I knew a key word.  
441  
00:43:17.630 \--\> 00:43:22.720  
P12: Right away, I'd like to just put that keyword in and see what pops up.  
442  
00:43:24.130 \--\> 00:43:26.110  
P12: Instead of reading through everything.  
443  
00:43:27.240 \--\> 00:43:28.740  
Moderator: That's really helpful feedback.  
444  
00:43:33.930 \--\> 00:43:36.819  
Moderator: Okay, just one more follow-up question.  
445  
00:43:39.530 \--\> 00:43:45.610  
Moderator: What do you think VAs should know about your experience signing up for benefits, getting benefits after transitioning?  
446  
00:43:48.270 \--\> 00:43:59.450  
P12: Gosh… Applying for benefits, or, like, the whole process of getting my benefits?  
447  
00:43:59.730 \--\> 00:44:10.950  
Moderator: Especially the process of discovery. Like, finding out how… finding out what's available to you, finding out how to… how to apply.  
448  
00:44:11.380 \--\> 00:44:14.880  
Moderator: The very beginning of starting to apply.  
449  
00:44:16.300 \--\> 00:44:19.340  
P12: Oh gosh, that was a long time ago.  
450  
00:44:20.260 \--\> 00:44:27.220  
P12: And I mean, you know, the VA didn't necessarily give me that information, it was the Army.  
451  
00:44:28.000 \--\> 00:44:32.129  
P12: You know, with those resources that… They hand it out.  
452  
00:44:34.410 \--\> 00:44:41.160  
P12: And back then, you know, the websites… It was far less… user-friendly, and…  
453  
00:44:45.580 \--\> 00:44:49.010  
P12: you know, I couldn't just… it was a lot… you had to…  
454  
00:44:49.170 \--\> 00:44:50.810  
P12: It was just a whole lot different.  
455  
00:44:51.060 \--\> 00:45:01.080  
P12: You know, I haven't applied, but even now on VA.gov, you know, I see there's way… it's way more straightforward of, like, hey, if you're looking to file another claim.  
456  
00:45:01.600 \--\> 00:45:04.309  
P12: You know, and what really sucked is when I got out was, like.  
457  
00:45:04.450 \--\> 00:45:08.250  
P12: There's a different site for education benefits, there's a different…  
458  
00:45:08.940 \--\> 00:45:14.100  
P12: You know, you had to go to a different… Whole area for…  
459  
00:45:16.000 \--\> 00:45:19.699  
P12: Medical, you know, and it was just… it was…  
460  
00:45:20.150 \--\> 00:45:22.870  
P12: That was kind of frustrating.  
461  
00:45:23.290 \--\> 00:45:27.550  
P12: So, I mean, you know that they have most of it compiled into VA.gov.  
462  
00:45:28.100 \--\> 00:45:30.239  
P12: I've been impressed with that, at least.  
463  
00:45:32.530 \--\> 00:45:34.330  
Moderator: Yeah, the consolidation.  
464  
00:45:34.580 \--\> 00:45:35.380  
P12: Yes.  
465  
00:45:35.540 \--\> 00:45:36.410  
P12: Yes.  
466  
00:45:40.590 \--\> 00:45:47.369  
Moderator: Well, that's… that's it for the test, that's it for my questions. Is there anything else you think I should know?  
467  
00:45:49.680 \--\> 00:45:52.909  
P12: I do not.  
468  
00:45:53.790 \--\> 00:45:55.809  
P12: That's… yeah, that's all I got.  
469  
00:45:56.300 \--\> 00:45:57.910  
Moderator: Great. Well.  
470  
00:45:58.010 \--\> 00:46:10.590  
Moderator: I wanted to circle back and reconfirm if you're comfortable if we share a video clip of this session with our VA partners, with your identifying information removed without your face.  
471  
00:46:11.270 \--\> 00:46:12.700  
P12: Yes, that is okay.  
472  
00:46:12.920 \--\> 00:46:17.480  
Moderator: Great. Is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?  
473  
00:46:18.440 \--\> 00:46:21.550  
P12: Nope, let's say that's okay.  
474  
00:46:21.910 \--\> 00:46:32.979  
Moderator: So, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans, and…  
475  
00:46:32.980 \--\> 00:46:46.309  
Moderator: Lastly, Parajan will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies. And thank you again so much, and enjoy the rest of your day.  
476  
00:46:46.590 \--\> 00:46:48.069  
P12: Alrighty, thank you, appreciate it.  
477  
00:46:48.070 \--\> 00:46:50.069  
Moderator: Yeah, thanks, bye\!  
478  
00:46:50.070 \--\> 00:46:50.950  
P12: Alright, bye.
