100:00:16.100 \--\> 00:00:17.180Moderator: All right.  
200:00:17.940 \--\> 00:00:20.199Moderator: We are good to go.  
300:00:20.760 \--\> 00:00:27.430Moderator: So to get started, can you tell me about the services that you are currently using on VA.gov?  
400:00:28.790 \--\> 00:00:35.879P2: services that I'm using under VA.gov? The health services are usually my to-go-to, my number one.  
500:00:36.000 \--\> 00:00:39.690P2: when I… oh, currently, yeah, that's…  
600:00:39.910 \--\> 00:00:43.929P2: typically the only one, VA health and, like, disability.  
700:00:44.250 \--\> 00:00:49.459P2: in the past, I was using more, but now that I've transitioned further out from  
800:00:49.670 \--\> 00:00:55.360P2: leaving the service, my involvement with the VA have just…  
900:00:55.660 \--\> 00:01:01.219P2: been reduced to the bare minimum. I would say, yeah, like I said, the healthcare, business, and disability.  
1000:01:02.490 \--\> 00:01:05.479Moderator: And, how long since he separated?  
1100:01:05.480 \--\> 00:01:12.309P2: Cool. It's been a… it's been a hot minute, because I noticed y'all were asking for those who were separated 10 years or less.  
1200:01:12.570 \--\> 00:01:14.020P2: in the,  
1300:01:15.440 \--\> 00:01:31.750P2: \[Perigean coordinator\]… I forgot her name, but anyway, she… yeah, she puts out the requirements for it. Anyway, it says 10 years or less. I am very close to hitting the 10-year mark. I would say, like, in now a month, month since… a month till, rather.  
1400:01:32.290 \--\> 00:01:42.609Moderator: Yeah, that is fine, because I know, like, transitioning is a big life event, and I'm sure that you, remember a lot about it, so…  
1500:01:42.610 \--\> 00:01:43.080P2: Hell yeah.  
1600:01:43.080 \--\> 00:01:48.490Moderator: It's totally fine that you're towards the end of that spectrum. So, it sounds like you use… you use healthcare a lot.  
1700:01:48.490 \--\> 00:01:48.850P2: Yes.  
1800:01:48.850 \--\> 00:01:49.320Moderator: grow your…  
1900:01:49.750 \--\> 00:01:58.030Moderator: comfortable with VA.gov. It says, says, in your, in your survey that, you're a comfortable user of technology.  
2000:01:58.500 \--\> 00:02:02.010Moderator: Yeah, I'll be taking that into account while we go through the…  
2100:02:03.020 \--\> 00:02:04.909Moderator: While we go through the test.  
2200:02:04.910 \--\> 00:02:12.000P2: Yeah, just like a little note that I was… when I was in the service, my job was surrounded by technology.  
2300:02:12.120 \--\> 00:02:20.889P2: And… I've always been a technology buff, and even my job involves technology, so I'm all for it, I know how to do all this business, so…  
2400:02:21.250 \--\> 00:02:30.710Moderator: Yeah, that's great, because, we want to make sure that it works for everybody, including people who are really comfortable and fluent. All right,  
2500:02:30.940 \--\> 00:02:40.179Moderator: So, I am, going to drop a link in the chat, and I'd like you to click it and share your screen in Zoom.  
2600:02:40.670 \--\> 00:02:41.320P2: Sure.  
2700:02:49.500 \--\> 00:03:04.190Moderator: So, you know, like I was saying about this being a prototype, it's a little slower, and, there might be a couple bugs, and if something like that comes up, and I notice it first, I'll let you know what is and isn't, you know.  
2800:03:04.340 \--\> 00:03:05.619Moderator: A result of that.  
2900:03:05.920 \--\> 00:03:14.909P2: Got it. Alright, I'm sharing my screen… Let's see… Here it is.  
3000:03:17.870 \--\> 00:03:19.570P2: Alright, do you see it?  
3100:03:21.500 \--\> 00:03:22.950Moderator: Yep, there you go.  
3200:03:23.140 \--\> 00:03:29.300Moderator: And before… before you start using this tool, have you ever used the live version of this tool on VA.gov before?  
3300:03:30.350 \--\> 00:03:32.000P2: this specific page?  
3400:03:33.620 \--\> 00:03:34.990P2: Let me see…  
3500:03:36.540 \--\> 00:03:49.819P2: I most likely have. I just took in a hot minute, but I definitely… whenever I was getting out, the VA page looked a lot different, so I… I would say 100% I have been on this page.  
3600:03:50.220 \--\> 00:04:07.409Moderator: Okay. Well, it'll probably look very different than last time you used it. But yeah, let's go ahead and get started. I… please, go through this as if I weren't here. The only difference is I'm gonna, stop you for questions, and please feel free to ask me questions. I might hold them till… the answer's till the end.  
3700:04:07.850 \--\> 00:04:11.730P2: Okay, but, Anna, do you want me to say verbally out loud?  
3800:04:11.730 \--\> 00:04:12.310Moderator: Yes.  
3900:04:12.310 \--\> 00:04:13.879P2: I'm thinking… oh, okay, cool.  
4000:04:13.880 \--\> 00:04:17.340Moderator: What you're thinking, what you're feeling, what you're noticing, questions you have.  
4100:04:17.690 \--\> 00:04:32.619P2: Easy. Alright, so I'll start it off, I'll pretend you're not here, and I'm gonna speak out loud what I'm… what I'm looking at. Okay, so I'm imagining that I recently got out of the service, and I need a… I need some sort of guideline.  
4200:04:32.740 \--\> 00:04:36.750P2: On what to do with my life after the service.  
4300:04:37.340 \--\> 00:04:38.600P2: So, let's see…  
4400:04:42.200 \--\> 00:04:52.440P2: So, in my personal situation, I definitely wanted to look into service-connected condition. I was wanting to go back… I wanted to go to college.  
4500:04:53.180 \--\> 00:04:57.700P2: definitely plan for my transition, I mean, all of this.  
4600:04:57.920 \--\> 00:05:08.469P2: Sounds right up my alley. I mean, when I got out, I was single, but I guess plan for my future. So all of this is right up my alley. I'm just gonna click a few.  
4700:05:09.140 \--\> 00:05:09.880Moderator: Great.  
4800:05:10.470 \--\> 00:05:13.189P2: That's good enough. So, moving on…  
4900:05:14.630 \--\> 00:05:22.239P2: In total, how long have you served? For example, I served close to 6 years, so I'll click the middle one.  
5000:05:22.820 \--\> 00:05:25.630P2: That's… Dang, less than 4 months.  
5100:05:26.690 \--\> 00:05:28.850P2: Okay.  
5200:05:29.300 \--\> 00:05:32.710Moderator: What do you think about the way these answers are laid out?  
5300:05:37.020 \--\> 00:05:40.890P2: I'm thinking about the choices now. The, the five…  
5400:05:41.130 \--\> 00:05:44.929P2: like, little circular options that I could choose from.  
5500:05:45.750 \--\> 00:05:50.109P2: I thought maybe… I guess a little,  
5600:05:50.270 \--\> 00:05:54.960P2: scroll, maybe? A little bit of a… Along…  
5700:05:55.150 \--\> 00:05:57.099P2: Thin line with a circle, and then…  
5800:05:57.100 \--\> 00:05:57.790Moderator: Like a slider?  
5900:05:57.790 \--\> 00:05:59.960P2: Yeah, thank you, a slide, gosh.  
6000:06:00.980 \--\> 00:06:02.569P2: A slider would be cool.  
6100:06:02.870 \--\> 00:06:07.659P2: But… that would be a plus, just because it's different.  
6200:06:07.950 \--\> 00:06:23.029P2: than what we would normally see, especially on the VA website, they like to use the multiple choice a lot. So 3 years to less than 10 years, that would fit my specific situation. If you served multiple periods, choose the answer at Flex, that would make sense.  
6300:06:23.090 \--\> 00:06:35.230P2: I would definitely want these questions, or this little tidbit included. If you guys do decide to go with a slider, I'm not… I'm not suggesting that you guys are, but that's important.  
6400:06:36.060 \--\> 00:06:41.849P2: This is straightforward. This doesn't need to change whatsoever. So, I was in the Army.  
6500:06:42.160 \--\> 00:06:43.370P2: Easy.  
6600:06:45.400 \--\> 00:06:48.170P2: and I was active service.  
6700:06:48.310 \--\> 00:06:55.920P2: And those who've served multiple, I'm sure they would do… they would click on more than one, but me, I just did active service.  
6800:06:56.540 \--\> 00:07:02.790P2: I am not serving in the military, so I would click no, straightforward, nothing confusing.  
6900:07:05.450 \--\> 00:07:12.729P2: A part of me… I know this would be probably difficult for the UX designers, the front end.  
7000:07:13.070 \--\> 00:07:23.339P2: Developers, but… being, I guess, more specific in how far along I am in the service section.  
7100:07:23.400 \--\> 00:07:26.289Moderator: You know, just cause I've asked, I've answered…  
7200:07:26.290 \--\> 00:07:36.559P2: you know, 4 or 5, if it would tell me, hey, you're at this marker right here of the service, because let's say I'm trying to do this in a limited time span, it would be cool to know  
7300:07:36.670 \--\> 00:07:40.500P2: how far along I am in this section. But, moving along…  
7400:07:40.950 \--\> 00:07:47.209Moderator: So it sounds like you're expecting the progress bar to be per question, and not just per topic.  
7500:07:47.420 \--\> 00:07:48.480P2: Yeah, yeah.  
7600:07:52.400 \--\> 00:07:57.820P2: How long did I separate and retire from service? It's been the last 3 years, so…  
7700:07:57.920 \--\> 00:08:05.759P2: That is straightforward. That can also be a slider, maybe, but if not, this is just… this is easy to comprehend, in my opinion.  
7800:08:07.610 \--\> 00:08:10.220P2: Alright, now discharge.  
7900:08:10.430 \--\> 00:08:16.310P2: What is the highest level of, highest character of discharge you have received?  
8000:08:16.920 \--\> 00:08:19.100P2: I've never heard of character.  
8100:08:19.460 \--\> 00:08:20.290P2: Okay.  
8200:08:20.420 \--\> 00:08:24.880P2: But I was… honorable? Easy.  
8300:08:25.080 \--\> 00:08:28.380Moderator: Is there a different terminology that you've heard?  
8400:08:29.610 \--\> 00:08:30.240Moderator: For Carol.  
8500:08:30.240 \--\> 00:08:33.860P2: Yeah, just, just, yeah, instead of character.  
8600:08:35.679 \--\> 00:08:42.330P2: I think service discharge? I think that was one of the ones I've heard before.  
8700:08:43.289 \--\> 00:08:48.159P2: But yeah, just character was a, I've just never seen it before.  
8800:08:49.880 \--\> 00:08:52.499P2: And options are straightforward.  
8900:08:53.030 \--\> 00:08:57.119P2: If you've served, you should've… you should know at least  
9000:08:57.620 \--\> 00:09:01.399P2: a couple of these, but I was honorable.  
9100:09:01.500 \--\> 00:09:07.070P2: I do have a disab… oh, if I'm thinking when I was leaving the service.  
9200:09:07.540 \--\> 00:09:11.360P2: I did not file a disability claim when I left.  
9300:09:11.610 \--\> 00:09:12.900P2: Stupid me.  
9400:09:15.790 \--\> 00:09:18.690P2: I… haven't filed one.  
9500:09:20.080 \--\> 00:09:21.600P2: Okay, and review.  
9600:09:22.380 \--\> 00:09:25.770P2: This I do recall seeing in the past.  
9700:09:31.330 \--\> 00:09:38.330P2: I do like the edit feature, just in case I do make a mess up. That's great. Selected, great. And it shows the…  
9800:09:38.450 \--\> 00:09:43.759P2: options, for the most part, of what I chose. I know I can't go into complete detail.  
9900:09:43.860 \--\> 00:09:45.570P2: But, that's good.  
10000:09:46.020 \--\> 00:09:49.730P2: Character disability, I have read, yes.  
10100:09:49.730 \--\> 00:09:52.770Moderator: Before you click submit, what are you expecting to see on the next page?  
10200:09:53.160 \--\> 00:10:01.070P2: what I am expecting to see… is… I would say it catered.  
10300:10:01.420 \--\> 00:10:05.050P2: A personalized page, listing.  
10400:10:05.630 \--\> 00:10:13.410P2: the parameters that I've inputted, so it should give me a page with certain links saying  
10500:10:13.950 \--\> 00:10:21.620P2: here's how to file, or here's the first step to filing a disability claim. Or,  
10600:10:24.900 \--\> 00:10:31.229P2: Let's see what else would have been related… okay, like, that disability part, along with…  
10700:10:31.440 \--\> 00:10:36.760P2: all of these. There should be links included into…  
10800:10:36.890 \--\> 00:10:39.319P2: Like, let's say we remove selected.  
10900:10:39.510 \--\> 00:10:50.800P2: And they give me this little table here, and there should be links, or just even hyperlink these texts, and be like, hey, go back to school, here are,  
11000:10:50.920 \--\> 00:11:06.300P2: yellow ribbon schools, you know, these are… these are public schools, these are private schools, you know, just… that's where the link would take me. Career fairs nearby, that's… that's probably what that link would tell me, or some sort of training.  
11100:11:06.430 \--\> 00:11:13.609P2: via healthcare that would fit my specific situations, because I know there's different levels  
11200:11:13.950 \--\> 00:11:18.040P2: levels or services… I forget what the… what the…  
11300:11:18.290 \--\> 00:11:34.820P2: metrics they use for it. But yeah, that's what I would expect on the next page. It's links that would be catered to what I put in for my goals, along with my service disability business that I want to possibly pursue filing a claim.  
11400:11:36.260 \--\> 00:11:42.049P2: This other stuff? Not really. This other is just… Like, admin, you know?  
11500:11:42.050 \--\> 00:11:43.499Moderator: About who I am.  
11600:11:45.110 \--\> 00:11:46.580P2: But yeah, that's what that would seem.  
11700:11:46.910 \--\> 00:11:49.790Moderator: Great, so when you're ready, go ahead and hit submit.  
11800:11:50.160 \--\> 00:11:50.850P2: Okay.  
11900:11:53.240 \--\> 00:11:58.060P2: Okay… Based on your answers, great.  
12000:11:58.220 \--\> 00:11:59.310P2: Great.  
12100:11:59.680 \--\> 00:12:01.979P2: You can go back and update, good.  
12200:12:03.070 \--\> 00:12:05.789P2: Oh, yeah, dependents. That's a good one.  
12300:12:07.010 \--\> 00:12:15.069Moderator: I, can you say more about that? I've noticed a lot of people are interested in dependent benefits and things that they're,  
12400:12:15.490 \--\> 00:12:17.899Moderator: When you were transitioning, for instance.  
12500:12:18.290 \--\> 00:12:22.719Moderator: What… what would have been helpful for you to see for dependents?  
12600:12:24.580 \--\> 00:12:25.740P2: Oh…  
12700:12:26.220 \--\> 00:12:46.019P2: for feedback, or for background knowledge, when I did transition, I went to community college, and I worked at a veteran service office, helping veterans, and a lot of it was, they didn't know what benefits they had, that they were allowed to, especially the dependents. So if they're…  
12800:12:47.980 \--\> 00:13:02.880P2: there needs to be, like, smack dab right here, information on how to get my dependent on my VI disability, you know, plan, or program, or my VA healthcare, that there… there needs to be a better  
12900:13:03.380 \--\> 00:13:16.780P2: front page exposure on how my dependents can be affected by my service, because now that I'm out of the service, I'm like, oh gosh, there's so much coming at me, I don't really know where to go to.  
13000:13:17.110 \--\> 00:13:19.479P2: I need to take care of my loved ones, boom.  
13100:13:19.970 \--\> 00:13:22.090P2: It should be right here. So…  
13200:13:22.550 \--\> 00:13:31.240P2: that would have been tremendously beneficial for me, but I had to go and search it myself, asking people, asking all sorts of people, but…  
13300:13:31.360 \--\> 00:13:40.009P2: That was 10 years ago. Now everyone's more involved in their technology, so just having it, let's say, on this page for dependents.  
13400:13:40.770 \--\> 00:13:50.609P2: Like, for one, there's… Hmm… Show results recommended for you. Yeah, something…  
13500:13:51.770 \--\> 00:13:55.869P2: That… that screams dependence on here as a filter.  
13600:13:55.870 \--\> 00:13:56.810Moderator: That way…  
13700:13:56.810 \--\> 00:14:04.260P2: be great. I know, I know that it's most likely gonna be under, let's say, healthcare.  
13800:14:04.520 \--\> 00:14:11.020P2: And let's say I apply the filter, It would say…  
13900:14:12.410 \--\> 00:14:21.160P2: Oh, well, it is just for me, huh? So, let's say all results… Foreign healthcare… see, like this?  
14000:14:21.920 \--\> 00:14:27.950P2: It's all about me, right? I know it says personalized up here when it said… But…  
14100:14:28.090 \--\> 00:14:33.349P2: Okay, previous question, then. On the previous page, go back and update your…  
14200:14:33.780 \--\> 00:14:36.319P2: Give me… give me something, let's say…  
14300:14:36.720 \--\> 00:14:39.559P2: Let's say I go edit here. Update the page.  
14400:14:39.810 \--\> 00:14:42.829P2: Okay. I would… if I selected this.  
14500:14:43.760 \--\> 00:14:49.369P2: family, I should expect to see dependents on the next page.  
14600:14:50.230 \--\> 00:14:52.799P2: Because I'm trying to take care of my family, right?  
14700:14:53.980 \--\> 00:14:55.140P2: I'm not sure.  
14800:14:58.440 \--\> 00:15:04.250P2: No, yeah. So, going back to your question, Anna, There needs to be.  
14900:15:04.810 \--\> 00:15:06.270P2: Test on here.  
15000:15:06.370 \--\> 00:15:08.710P2: screaming dependents.  
15100:15:08.710 \--\> 00:15:12.260Moderator: How can I… how can I get financial help for my dependents?  
15200:15:12.260 \--\> 00:15:18.940P2: I'm now taking care of, let's say, Some more support.  
15300:15:19.130 \--\> 00:15:29.639P2: you know, because there's some dependents that you… that I… let's say I have to take care of, I physically have to take care of, that I am entitled, by the VA, a financial benefit for.  
15400:15:29.640 \--\> 00:15:31.589Moderator: Where would that be under?  
15500:15:31.590 \--\> 00:15:40.979P2: again, some sort of dependent, button, some filter on here would be great. But does that answer your question? And then I can get more into this.  
15600:15:41.320 \--\> 00:15:56.919Moderator: Yeah, that, that answers my question, and, let's circle back to it after we look at the design of the page, because I have a couple of follow-up questions, but I don't want to… I don't want to color your exploration too much by talking through them right now.  
15700:15:57.270 \--\> 00:16:03.240P2: Okay, makes sense. So yeah, I read this part, you stopped me about the dependence, now I'm gonna go back to this page.  
15800:16:03.570 \--\> 00:16:14.819P2: This section here. So, I like that it's defaulted for me, because that's the point of me filling out the questionnaire previously. When to apply? Well.  
15900:16:15.730 \--\> 00:16:34.650P2: This is… I don't know if they call it, taps anymore, but when I was in, they called it taps for transitioning after the service. So let's say it's for me after the service. That's where I'm getting into this. So I click on after separation. This is great, too, before and after, because let's say during the taps.  
16000:16:34.900 \--\> 00:16:50.109P2: process. While in the service, they inform us of visiting this page. I would obviously click on before, because I'm still in the service. After, in this scenario, I've left the service. Great. Benefit type.  
16100:16:56.790 \--\> 00:17:01.819P2: Let me just… not click on any of these, let me see what filters they'll give me.  
16200:17:02.140 \--\> 00:17:06.530P2: Regardless. Okay. Great. Disability, good.  
16300:17:07.520 \--\> 00:17:09.770P2: Disability, yes.  
16400:17:11.270 \--\> 00:17:15.520P2: God, that's good. State veterans, that's incredibly useful.  
16500:17:16.300 \--\> 00:17:20.599P2: I guess so.  
16600:17:22.109 \--\> 00:17:25.569P2: VA-backed home loans, that's good to hear as well.  
16700:17:25.810 \--\> 00:17:28.199P2: A lot of these are recommended for me.  
16800:17:28.890 \--\> 00:17:29.880P2: Okay.  
16900:17:32.180 \--\> 00:17:36.329Moderator: Do you know why they all say recommended for me?  
17000:17:36.330 \--\> 00:17:44.270P2: Oh, yeah, based on… based on what I put in the questionnaire previously. Then that's why. So now, let's click on all results.  
17100:17:44.620 \--\> 00:17:46.180P2: This should go away.  
17200:17:47.050 \--\> 00:17:50.160P2: For recommended for you. Okay, cool.  
17300:17:50.810 \--\> 00:17:52.049P2: Now,  
17400:17:54.360 \--\> 00:17:55.220P2: Hmm.  
17500:17:56.500 \--\> 00:18:01.779P2: It still says recommended for you. I guess… I guess that's… I guess that's still good.  
17600:18:04.800 \--\> 00:18:06.620Moderator: You're,  
17700:18:09.520 \--\> 00:18:22.600Moderator: Could you scroll back up to the filters? I just want to see, to confirm something. Did you… sorry, Ann, I missed this. Did you hit conf… If you scroll down just a tiny bit, apply filters after…  
17800:18:23.140 \--\> 00:18:24.040Moderator: You clicked.  
17900:18:24.430 \--\> 00:18:28.360P2: Yes, yes I did, yeah. After I clicked all results.  
18000:18:28.400 \--\> 00:18:30.269Moderator: Okay. From… yeah.  
18100:18:30.270 \--\> 00:18:46.449P2: from recommended for you, I switched to all results, and then I, clicked on apply filters, and then it's given me this, and it's still showing the recommended for you. A part of me thought that it would just be a blanket. Blanket, where it doesn't… it wouldn't say recommended.  
18200:18:46.450 \--\> 00:18:47.300Moderator: Mmm.  
18300:18:47.300 \--\> 00:18:55.030P2: But, I mean, that's… that's fine, I guess. That's okay, but let's say I'm impatient, which most people are.  
18400:18:57.000 \--\> 00:19:01.240P2: I don't… I just wanna see… everything.  
18500:19:01.960 \--\> 00:19:12.410Moderator: So you're imagining recommended and then not recommended for you. Like, being able to turn off so you don't see the recommended for you alongside the rest of them.  
18600:19:12.410 \--\> 00:19:26.119P2: But granted, granted, granted, it's not a deal-breaker, you know? I'm bringing up the patience portions, because let's say someone doesn't want to scroll through all of these options.  
18700:19:26.120 \--\> 00:19:35.009P2: And still get flooded with the recommended for you, because that's where I would have been anyway for… for… by this defaulted button.  
18800:19:35.500 \--\> 00:19:50.509P2: And I understand, now that we're speaking about it, all results would be everything, even including the recommended for you. I guess I'm just playing devil's advocate for the lazy people out there that only want to see things that are not recommended for me.  
18900:19:50.970 \--\> 00:20:00.400P2: just to gain some more information, because let's say I work in a VSO, VSO, a Veteran Service Office, and I don't want to…  
19000:20:02.040 \--\> 00:20:13.609P2: I don't need to learn any more about this stuff that caters to me. I would want to just focus on Chapter 36, or VGLI, but those are just small, like.  
19100:20:13.960 \--\> 00:20:15.260P2: narrowed…  
19200:20:15.630 \--\> 00:20:22.890P2: instances. So, I feel like I'm making… I feel like I'm making a mountain out of a motel, though, Anna.  
19300:20:23.740 \--\> 00:20:32.800Moderator: Yeah, but what's really interesting about your perspective on this is that you have worked for VSO, or do you currently work for VSO?  
19400:20:32.800 \--\> 00:20:35.540P2: Oh, no, I didn't, no. I did it for 2 years.  
19500:20:35.540 \--\> 00:20:36.320Moderator: You didn't forget.  
19600:20:36.320 \--\> 00:21:01.229Moderator: a few years. Yeah, so I have noticed, talking to veterans, that people who have done veteran services, like, like Vet Success on Campus, or, you know, currently work for VSO, they're using VA.gov in a different way, and we want to think about those users, too. So, not everyone is going to be doing this for themselves alone. They're going to be looking for benefits for their dependents. They are going to be  
19700:21:01.230 \--\> 00:21:14.870Moderator: looking for benefits for a sibling who is having a rougher transition disability in life than they did, or for someone they served with, or, like, professionally for VSO clients. So…  
19800:21:15.570 \--\> 00:21:23.370Moderator: It sounds like this is something that we, you know, we need to look into.  
19900:21:23.810 \--\> 00:21:36.230P2: Yeah, no, like, the amount of times that I would shoulder, I guess shoulder shadow, not shadow, I would be… I would be behind someone, and they would be on the computer, typing away, or feeling this  
20000:21:36.230 \--\> 00:21:49.520P2: you know, example out, and I'll just give them pointers on, oh, don't worry about this part, this isn't gonna affect you because of blah blah blah blah blah. You know, that's just my personal anecdotal, you know.  
20100:21:50.360 \--\> 00:21:57.780P2: situation that I'm just bringing in here. But, let's see… We can continue.  
20200:21:58.040 \--\> 00:22:00.420P2: Yeah, yep.  
20300:22:00.420 \--\> 00:22:05.670Moderator: So, question, when you are scrolling up and down the page, looking at the cards, what is.  
20400:22:06.120 \--\> 00:22:09.499Moderator: What are you noticing first, and how are you deciding what to look at?  
20500:22:09.910 \--\> 00:22:11.480P2: Oh, first thing is, I…  
20600:22:11.990 \--\> 00:22:26.669P2: I type a lot, you know, I'm always on computer. So, whenever it's bolded, that's where my eyes go, naturally, on here. So, I… I definitely see, you know, whenever I see Chapter 36, we would be like, oh, okay, was this… is this relevant for me?  
20700:22:26.910 \--\> 00:22:30.729P2: let's say it is, then I would be like, oh, this other bottom…  
20800:22:31.620 \--\> 00:22:34.440P2: If it's relevant for me, I'll read it a little bit here.  
20900:22:35.250 \--\> 00:22:45.450P2: then I would look at this bolded part, when to apply, oh gosh, I need to apply soon. Let me click on learn more, it'll take me to a new page. You know, that's the first thing that pops into my head.  
21000:22:45.740 \--\> 00:22:48.970P2: My thing is, I wonder why…  
21100:22:49.290 \--\> 00:22:52.210P2: The overall title itself isn't,  
21200:22:52.400 \--\> 00:22:55.719P2: Doesn't stand out more? Or does this even need to be?  
21300:22:56.450 \--\> 00:23:04.450P2: Even here, disability… I guess it does, it's just… This takes a back step.  
21400:23:04.800 \--\> 00:23:07.430P2: To this text right here.  
21500:23:08.280 \--\> 00:23:09.460P2: So…  
21600:23:10.020 \--\> 00:23:17.369P2: It's fine, because most people would see GI Bill, and they've been told about it many times in the service, so that's where their eyes would go.  
21700:23:17.750 \--\> 00:23:26.730P2: And it would… and it's right… it's right below education, so I think it's fine the way it is. Bolded is good. Giving dates.  
21800:23:27.980 \--\> 00:23:32.709P2: is very important. Having a link there, even better.  
21900:23:34.980 \--\> 00:23:40.969P2: I mean, overall, I can't… I can't really nitpick too much about this, because it is helpful.  
22000:23:42.400 \--\> 00:23:44.500P2: Yeah, that's basically it, Diana.  
22100:23:44.970 \--\> 00:23:47.140Moderator: Great. What do you think of…  
22200:23:47.300 \--\> 00:23:50.189Moderator: Okay, backing up a little.  
22300:23:50.680 \--\> 00:23:54.670Moderator: how do you think that this is sorted? Like, what order do you think.  
22400:23:54.670 \--\> 00:23:55.610P2: Mmm.  
22500:23:55.790 \--\> 00:24:03.570P2: I have no idea how it's sorted. You know, that's the thing. I got no idea. Is it… is it alphabetically? Is it… obviously, it's by all results, so…  
22600:24:03.700 \--\> 00:24:06.560P2: I don't know, like, even this…  
22700:24:06.720 \--\> 00:24:10.590P2: I guess sooner… soonest first, so I would have to check the sorting.  
22800:24:11.050 \--\> 00:24:17.520P2: That's how you do it, okay. So I guess by default, soonest first. You know what? That's a good call.  
22900:24:17.690 \--\> 00:24:20.649P2: That's a good call to have this as a default option.  
23000:24:20.930 \--\> 00:24:29.219P2: Because time is a factor, especially leaving the service, where 180 days isn't long at all. It's extremely short.  
23100:24:29.220 \--\> 00:24:30.180Moderator: So…  
23200:24:30.180 \--\> 00:24:33.779P2: Having this as a sort, as the default, I think that's good.  
23300:24:34.130 \--\> 00:24:37.050P2: That's a good call. So, thank you for bringing that up.  
23400:24:37.340 \--\> 00:24:44.420P2: If not, I would have just assumed, oh, it's by random order. No, it's not, it's by this section here.  
23500:24:44.760 \--\> 00:24:51.640Moderator: Yeah, yeah, and it sounds like you didn't notice it right away.  
23600:24:51.640 \--\> 00:24:52.250P2: \-  
23700:24:52.640 \--\> 00:24:57.039P2: No, no, not at all, because again, my eyes went straight to the bold.  
23800:24:57.210 \--\> 00:24:57.630Moderator: It does.  
23900:24:57.630 \--\> 00:25:05.119P2: straight to the bolded part. You know, if you bold the short, then I might stop and be like, oh, you know what? Okay, let me pay attention to this.  
24000:25:05.740 \--\> 00:25:15.509Moderator: Did you notice how many benefits, or, before you started scrolling down, did you… did you have an expectation of how many it would be? Did it feel like a lot?  
24100:25:16.250 \--\> 00:25:30.919P2: Oh, like, if I'm brand new leaving the service, oh yeah, it would feel like a lot. It would feel somewhat overwhelming, you know? Just because, let's… I joined at 17, left at, like, 24, or whatever. So, coming into the real world.  
24200:25:31.270 \--\> 00:25:34.670P2: And figuring out all of this, yeah, it can be overwhelming, for sure.  
24300:25:36.010 \--\> 00:25:36.970P2: But…  
24400:25:37.560 \--\> 00:25:49.929P2: thankfully, I matured since 17 to 24\. I would have enough cognitive development to be like, okay, this doesn't affect me, I'm not dying anytime soon, I think, you know? I'm 24, I don't really need life insurance.  
24500:25:50.130 \--\> 00:25:54.979P2: And then I can go through the, you know, what's necessary and what's not.  
24600:25:59.180 \--\> 00:26:01.930Moderator: I'm check… I'm, checking my notes for a second.  
24700:26:01.930 \--\> 00:26:02.570P2: Okay.  
24800:26:15.590 \--\> 00:26:16.460P2: That's good.  
24900:26:16.460 \--\> 00:26:21.630Moderator: So, follow-up question about what you said about the link.  
25000:26:23.980 \--\> 00:26:33.519Moderator: I… so I noticed that you, you almost clicked on a couple of them. Could you please go to one of the ones you thought about clicking, and click it?  
25100:26:33.900 \--\> 00:26:37.099P2: Sure, since I brought up about disability quite a bit.  
25200:26:37.990 \--\> 00:26:39.740P2: I will click on Learn More.  
25300:26:44.750 \--\> 00:26:46.359P2: Okay, good.  
25400:26:47.600 \--\> 00:26:51.980P2: And then clicking on this usually just forces the page, yep, like normal.  
25500:26:53.470 \--\> 00:26:58.789P2: I mean, I think… I think this is great, especially big, bolded letters. I don't know what this…  
25600:26:58.900 \--\> 00:27:06.120P2: icon would necessarily mean, I guess just paperwork-wise, but having this slightly bolded is good.  
25700:27:09.530 \--\> 00:27:12.559P2: Let me… let me click on a different one, besides that.  
25800:27:19.860 \--\> 00:27:21.520P2: Let's click on GI benefit.  
25900:27:21.520 \--\> 00:27:25.330Moderator: That little bit of lagginess, that's the… that's the… that's the prototype.  
26000:27:25.580 \--\> 00:27:26.330P2: Okay.  
26100:27:26.490 \--\> 00:27:28.640P2: So let's click on the GI benefits.  
26200:27:29.370 \--\> 00:27:35.850P2: Yeah, I've always liked it when they had this in the green and blue sort of business.  
26300:27:35.980 \--\> 00:27:39.139P2: So it's just a quick, fast link to get what I need.  
26400:27:39.140 \--\> 00:27:41.129Moderator: That's always been good.  
26500:27:41.240 \--\> 00:27:43.430P2: Yeah, no, the links are great.  
26600:27:43.610 \--\> 00:27:44.460P2: Too far.  
26700:27:45.940 \--\> 00:27:49.420Moderator: When you navigated away, were you expecting to be able to come back?  
26800:27:50.240 \--\> 00:27:53.299P2: Oh yeah, when I clicked on Learn More.  
26900:27:53.300 \--\> 00:27:53.620Moderator: Yeah.  
27000:27:53.620 \--\> 00:28:03.450P2: let's say I'm done with that page, I want to go back, it should go immediately back to this page. It should 100% not take me back to me trying to fill this out once again.  
27100:28:03.620 \--\> 00:28:07.650P2: That's… that's too many steps. I've already done it, why do I need to do it again?  
27200:28:10.870 \--\> 00:28:25.779Moderator: So, imagine, we had a decision to make with the cards, whether to link to learn more, and to link to the main benefit, or to link to apply. Which do you… do you think we made the right.  
27300:28:27.220 \--\> 00:28:28.929P2: I personally think…  
27400:28:29.140 \--\> 00:28:46.989P2: y'all made the right call to click on the Learn More, and it gives me a more detailed summary of what this disability compensation would be, instead of an apply. I don't… apply is a big step forward, you know? But I'm going in… I'm going into this kind of blind.  
27500:28:46.990 \--\> 00:28:52.519P2: I know I need to do disability, because a lot of my buddies said, man, you gotta apply for disability. Great.  
27600:28:52.730 \--\> 00:28:57.379P2: But what am I getting myself into? What's the negatives of applying too soon?  
27700:28:57.490 \--\> 00:29:09.239P2: And if this just goes to apply, I may feel, again, overwhelmed and not having a clear, full picture of what I'm getting myself into. So whenever I click on Learn More.  
27800:29:09.580 \--\> 00:29:12.010P2: I'm literally learning more.  
27900:29:12.280 \--\> 00:29:18.780P2: about this program that the government gives me. And then I can go down and, you know.  
28000:29:19.640 \--\> 00:29:24.360P2: make a decision based on all this information that I learned about. And then…  
28100:29:26.000 \--\> 00:29:28.070P2: Is there an apply on here?  
28200:29:31.310 \--\> 00:29:34.719P2: Like, if they had another, like, on the GI Bill.  
28300:29:35.440 \--\> 00:29:41.069P2: The sense where it has the blue and the green, like I mentioned, if they also had a big button like that.  
28400:29:41.390 \--\> 00:29:42.500P2: 4?  
28500:29:42.840 \--\> 00:29:48.010P2: For an individual who's like, alright, I'm confident enough, Let me get started.  
28600:29:48.130 \--\> 00:29:50.210P2: On how to… how to do this business.  
28700:29:50.930 \--\> 00:29:51.780Moderator: Excellent.  
28800:29:52.910 \--\> 00:29:59.079Moderator: So, I don't have any more questions about the prototype of…  
28900:30:01.000 \--\> 00:30:10.230Moderator: I have a few follow-up questions. And first is, is this tool helpful for you today? Is this something you would want to come back to?  
29000:30:11.030 \--\> 00:30:16.580P2: Well, for me, now that I've been…  
29100:30:17.280 \--\> 00:30:20.089P2: informed so much about the VA.  
29200:30:21.470 \--\> 00:30:28.349P2: I mean, yeah, you know what, no, I'm… I'm… I'm believing, belittled me.  
29300:30:28.570 \--\> 00:30:30.640P2: my… myself…  
29400:30:30.750 \--\> 00:30:43.110P2: on thinking that I… I know so much that I can just do this without having to go back to resources. Now, I would 100% go back to this, because, for example, let's say I… I don't own a home yet, so I'm renting it.  
29500:30:43.110 \--\> 00:30:55.689P2: And in the back of my mind, this business is literally in the back of my mind, always about VA home loans, and when I need to pull the trigger. So, when I'm at that point of my life where I want to purchase a home.  
29600:30:55.910 \--\> 00:31:05.290P2: I think this would be very beneficial to go back to and learn, but what I would do is probably just go to search and type in VA Home Loan.  
29700:31:05.390 \--\> 00:31:08.929P2: page, you know? So I can just go straight there.  
29800:31:09.300 \--\> 00:31:16.089P2: Instead of going to this business, because I already know… I've already discovered the benefits.  
29900:31:16.510 \--\> 00:31:21.950P2: I just need to learn more about them directly, instead of having to…  
30000:31:22.220 \--\> 00:31:24.399P2: Filter, you know, do the questionnaire.  
30100:31:24.400 \--\> 00:31:25.040Moderator: Yeah.  
30200:31:26.310 \--\> 00:31:33.400Moderator: So, 1 to 5\. How would you rate your satisfaction with The prototype you saw today.  
30300:31:50.410 \--\> 00:31:55.420P2: I would say… I think we've been, like, a 4\.  
30400:31:55.680 \--\> 00:32:09.870P2: 5 is basically perfect in my book, and almost nothing's perfect. So, I think it's great, it does the job, it answers the questions that I, if I was transitioning now, would want.  
30500:32:10.040 \--\> 00:32:13.729P2: to… to get more information about, like, if I was coming in  
30600:32:14.910 \--\> 00:32:27.710P2: like, I had no information on my benefits, going to the whole Discover Your Benefits page and filling out the questionnaire, because questionnaires… simple enough, a few buttons here or there.  
30700:32:28.890 \--\> 00:32:33.439P2: then it would guide me to where I need to go, recommendations.  
30800:32:34.370 \--\> 00:32:38.279P2: I would feel a lot more comfortable than just them giving me  
30900:32:39.350 \--\> 00:32:56.599P2: a big textbook, or, like, a big little pad saying, this is where you go, you got flip, flip, flip. Does this cater to you? Oh, you have to visit this site, you have to type this URL. Now, this is great. It literally guides me to what I need to do.  
31000:32:56.800 \--\> 00:32:58.379P2: So, yeah, 4 out of 5\.  
31100:32:59.250 \--\> 00:33:03.619Moderator: Awesome, that's good, that's good to hear. So I…  
31200:33:03.710 \--\> 00:33:05.230P2: You already gave…  
31300:33:05.230 \--\> 00:33:06.070Moderator: What?  
31400:33:06.070 \--\> 00:33:13.539P2: One business. I would say the one part that didn't give the 5, that didn't bump it up, is the part that you mentioned regarding the dependents.  
31500:33:14.080 \--\> 00:33:16.010P2: more… more…  
31600:33:16.740 \--\> 00:33:29.909P2: more areas that would specify dependent care, you know? Like, if there was another one that's for just, like, dependents only, then I'd be like, oh, shoot, I need to care about my family first and foremost.  
31700:33:30.120 \--\> 00:33:46.569P2: I… I get all of this, but let me see what can job fairs for… for spouses, you know? Or local events for… for spouses to get transitioned back into real life, instead of living on base and living that sort of…  
31800:33:46.880 \--\> 00:33:50.470P2: In that environment. So yeah, I would say…  
31900:33:50.770 \--\> 00:33:55.640P2: 4 at its current state, 5K or more to dependents, yeah.  
32000:33:56.670 \--\> 00:33:57.540Moderator: Good to know.  
32100:33:58.040 \--\> 00:34:06.379Moderator: And I think you just gave me the answer to this, but I'm gonna ask anyway. What would you change about this tool to help someone transitioning from active duty?  
32200:34:07.430 \--\> 00:34:10.060P2: Yeah, definitely the dependence part,  
32300:34:18.870 \--\> 00:34:20.099P2: Let's see…  
32400:34:23.320 \--\> 00:34:28.409P2: if I'm transitioning, What would I want to see from this page?  
32500:34:38.120 \--\> 00:34:39.492P2: I'm like a…  
32600:34:41.350 \--\> 00:34:53.980P2: like, a part of me, I felt alone when I was transitioning, you know? I felt… I felt alone in the process. You fill out the paperwork, and you… you… you get out of the base.  
32700:34:54.940 \--\> 00:34:55.760P2: And…  
32800:34:56.340 \--\> 00:35:07.310P2: If you're doing the classes portion of where the base is helping you transition, you're… when I was doing it, you're in a group with other people, and they're trying to do it as well.  
32900:35:07.420 \--\> 00:35:10.389P2: But after that, you pop smoke, and you have to go and…  
33000:35:10.690 \--\> 00:35:14.690P2: Take care of the items that cater to your specific situation.  
33100:35:15.010 \--\> 00:35:17.760P2: I don't know if that could make it more,  
33200:35:19.320 \--\> 00:35:28.249P2: If there was some sort of group or some sort of way to communicate with others who are possibly leaving at the same time.  
33300:35:28.390 \--\> 00:35:31.130P2: Or, heavy…  
33400:35:31.610 \--\> 00:35:40.290P2: They're going to the same area that you are when they transition, so that it's not so lonely when you leave the base and, like.  
33500:35:41.040 \--\> 00:35:44.470P2: Military's done. You're out into the real world.  
33600:35:44.760 \--\> 00:35:49.749P2: they push you out, and then that's that. But if there was some sort of more, you know.  
33700:35:49.890 \--\> 00:35:56.519P2: Companionship, or some… some way to integrate this transition with others.  
33800:35:56.660 \--\> 00:36:04.869P2: That, that would, that would very… that would be very helpful, because, yeah, it can be a very lonely process, and a scary, 100% scary.  
33900:36:04.980 \--\> 00:36:13.750P2: Especially if I've had individuals that, when they transitioned, there was no one there for them when they left, so that they went down a bad rabbit hole.  
34000:36:14.000 \--\> 00:36:20.920P2: I know that doesn't really… I don't know how you would do it, like, here, but that's just my personal anecdote of, like…  
34100:36:21.080 \--\> 00:36:23.609P2: We need to care for our vets truly.  
34200:36:24.020 \--\> 00:36:25.660P2: Yeah.  
34300:36:25.820 \--\> 00:36:32.200Moderator: No, that's exactly the kind of feedback that we need to know, because, you know, that's…  
34400:36:32.470 \--\> 00:36:46.420Moderator: We're… we're trying to focus on the experience holistically as much as can be done with technology, and so knowing that there needs to be human connection on top of knowledge is really important. So, thank you for sharing that.  
34500:36:46.810 \--\> 00:36:47.730P2: Hell yeah. Oh, yeah.  
34600:36:48.720 \--\> 00:36:55.590Moderator: We are at time, but I want to give you the opportunity, if there's anything you haven't said, that you want to share.  
34700:36:56.070 \--\> 00:37:01.659P2: Nope, you just heard it. That last little tidbit that I had. That's what I got. I got nothing else.  
34800:37:02.150 \--\> 00:37:10.790Moderator: Yeah, I really appreciate your time, and I want to circle back, reconfirm, are you comfortable if we were to share a video clip of your session?  
34900:37:10.790 \--\> 00:37:11.190P2: Oh.  
35000:37:12.850 \--\> 00:37:13.330P2: Sure.  
35100:37:13.330 \--\> 00:37:21.840Moderator: Yeah, and that would be removed of any identifying information. Is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?  
35200:37:22.210 \--\> 00:37:25.080P2: Nope, all good to go. You can take it.  
35300:37:25.290 \--\> 00:37:35.390Moderator: Well, that's… that's it. I appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts so much, and, we… we could not do this without you.  
35400:37:35.460 \--\> 00:37:54.079Moderator: It's gonna help us continue to make the VA.gov better, make sure it really works for veterans, so thank you again. And finally, Perigian is going to be sending a thank you note with a little blurb. You can pass it along to other veterans, so that they'll have a chance to participate in future studies. And one more thing.  
35500:37:54.080 \--\> 00:38:05.399Moderator: Because you said that, Discover Your Benefits would be useful to you, I dropped a link in the chat, to the live tool, which looks a little bit different, but the…  
35600:38:05.400 \--\> 00:38:14.379Moderator: The design that you're seeing in the prototype, that's going to be live some… in, February, so you can expect it to look more like what you just saw.  
35700:38:14.670 \--\> 00:38:16.929Moderator: About a month from now,  
35800:38:17.390 \--\> 00:38:25.930Moderator: But, the core… the core things that you liked about the tool are already there, and, yeah, so you… you can use it for real.  
35900:38:27.150 \--\> 00:38:32.979P2: Thank you. Yeah, I just saved the link, so I'll save it on my phone for later.  
36000:38:33.140 \--\> 00:38:34.260Moderator: Excellent\!  
36100:38:35.400 \--\> 00:38:40.710Moderator: Yeah, thanks so much. Take care, hope you have a great day.  
36200:38:40.710 \--\> 00:38:42.549P2: Alright, thank you all. Bye-bye.  
36300:38:42.550 \--\> 00:38:43.150Moderator: Bye.
