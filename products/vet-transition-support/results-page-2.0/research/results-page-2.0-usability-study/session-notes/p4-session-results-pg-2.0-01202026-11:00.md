| Complete questionnaire easily | Yes |
| Questionnaire observations | Reads intro content and goes through the footer. Selects "Go back to school" Goes through questionnaire really quickly Review page \- not surprised by anything on this page, but pauses to confirm what it's showing. |
| Finding sort | No |
| Notes on finding sort | Asked if he knew how they're sorted, but still didn't see it. |
| Use sort as expected? | Yes |
| Notes on using sort | Expected to see it sorted by type of benefit, not by expiration date |
| Finding filters | Yes |
| Notes on finding filters | Immediately starts adjusting the filters |
| Use filters as expected? | Yes |
| Notes on using filters | Filters by Recommended, After separation, Careers and employment, Disability, Education Still has GI Bill, so selected Education. Doesn't know what he's eligible for with disability Knows there are good opportunieis with careers, so wants to see that. Other benefits seem more relevant to older Veterans. Thought disability filter would bring up disability housing, but it didn't. Thought vetsuccess on campus would be under education? |

| Notes on recommended vs all | Clicks all results \- but didn't click "apply results" Says he clicked it, but nothing changed. |
| Exploring and understanding when to apply filter | Yes |
| Notes on when to apply filter | Before/after separation is telling him when he can apply for things. He already separated, so he selected "after separation". The military does a terrible job of explaining this stuff... most of this stuff is "word of mouth" but doesn't know anyone looking at this stuff before separation. This tool should be in TAP. |
| Found benefit information easily | Yes with help |
| Notes on finding benefit information | Clicked on Disability benefits \- has trouble getting back to our tool When he went back, his filters went away. He expected his benefits to be there (like they are). Clicks on cards in order. Learn more vs Apply now \- Likes Learn More because some people need that introductory information before applying. When to apply \- didn't see the deadline on the card when he was first scrolling |

| Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared? | No |
| Recording consent | Yes |
| Consent to share clips | Yes |

Moderator: Okay, I have started recording. I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  
2  
00:00:14.920 \--\> 00:00:15.560  
P4: Yes.  
3  
00:00:16.820 \--\> 00:00:25.660  
Moderator: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?  
4  
00:00:25.660 \--\> 00:00:26.310  
P4: Yes.  
5  
00:00:26.810 \--\> 00:00:33.100  
Moderator: Okay, so we can get started with, with our interview and testing.  
6  
00:00:33.310 \--\> 00:00:39.729  
Moderator: So I want to start by asking, what services are you currently using on VA.gov?  
7  
00:00:40.920 \--\> 00:00:42.040  
P4: Boom.  
8  
00:00:43.440 \--\> 00:00:47.910  
P4: Currently, the health… The disability…  
9  
00:00:49.070 \--\> 00:00:52.499  
P4: And then in the past, I've used the education.  
10  
00:00:54.870 \--\> 00:01:00.499  
Moderator: So for the ones that you're using right now, health and disability, how often do you use them?  
11  
00:01:07.270 \--\> 00:01:17.429  
P4: So sometimes I'll go, like, a month without needing to log on, and then sometimes it's, like, multiple times a day I need to log on and look at something, or I'm trying to, like, see if something updated.  
12  
00:01:18.760 \--\> 00:01:22.850  
Moderator: Good. How long ago did you set up your VA.gov account?  
13  
00:01:25.790 \--\> 00:01:29.919  
P4: Two, 4th… May 4 years ago?  
14  
00:01:31.200 \--\> 00:01:31.920  
Moderator: Okay.  
15  
00:01:34.680 \--\> 00:01:46.000  
Moderator: So, we can get started with our test. I'm gonna drop a link in the chat for you, and I'd like you to click on it, open it up in a browser, and then share your screen.  
16  
00:01:51.160 \--\> 00:01:53.169  
Moderator: Hope you could please click on that.  
17  
00:01:55.290 \--\> 00:01:56.010  
P4: Hmm.  
18  
00:02:21.760 \--\> 00:02:32.299  
Moderator: And, sometimes on mobile, when you share a screen in Zoom, it will kick you out of the meeting, so if that happens, it's fine. Please don't be stressed about it.  
19  
00:02:33.080 \--\> 00:02:35.759  
Moderator: issue with Zoom.  
20  
00:02:37.120 \--\> 00:02:40.040  
Moderator: Just, try and rejoin.  
21  
00:02:42.700 \--\> 00:02:45.109  
P4: What is not liking me.  
22  
00:02:46.880 \--\> 00:02:48.800  
P4: Trying to open your link.  
23  
00:02:49.460 \--\> 00:02:50.160  
Moderator: Hmm.  
24  
00:02:51.040 \--\> 00:02:59.839  
Moderator: Oh… Is it asking you for, like, to click continue? There might be, like, a green continue button?  
25  
00:03:00.020 \--\> 00:03:05.290  
P4: It says, do you want to download Discover Your Benefits? And it wants me to download it.  
26  
00:03:06.090 \--\> 00:03:10.100  
P4: And then if I hit download… Go away.  
27  
00:03:10.640 \--\> 00:03:18.040  
Moderator: Interesting, I've never… I've never seen that before. What browser are you opening it in?  
28  
00:03:18.040 \--\> 00:03:18.710  
P4: Barge?  
29  
00:03:19.580 \--\> 00:03:20.749  
Moderator: Safari, you said?  
30  
00:03:20.990 \--\> 00:03:22.890  
P4: You want me to try,  
31  
00:03:26.810 \--\> 00:03:29.509  
P4: Let me try… I'll be in that.  
32  
00:03:31.730 \--\> 00:03:33.800  
P4: I'll try it in, Google Chrome.  
33  
00:03:34.170 \--\> 00:03:35.699  
Moderator: Yeah, sounds good.  
34  
00:04:05.240 \--\> 00:04:06.430  
P4: Can you still hear me?  
35  
00:04:06.430 \--\> 00:04:06.960  
Moderator: Yep.  
36  
00:04:16.100 \--\> 00:04:20.230  
Moderator: Okay, and I am going to open it on…  
37  
00:04:20.550 \--\> 00:04:32.249  
Moderator: I'm gonna try it in Safari and Firefox, and, see if I… on my phone, and I'm gonna see if I can't see what you are dealing with.  
38  
00:04:32.670 \--\> 00:04:37.460  
P4: Yeah, even on Google, it wants me to download it, and then when I hit download, it just…  
39  
00:04:38.300 \--\> 00:04:40.510  
P4: Like, it goes back to the…  
40  
00:04:43.110 \--\> 00:04:49.379  
Moderator: Yeah. You know, I'm having… I'm having the same issue. It's, it is…  
41  
00:04:49.540 \--\> 00:05:00.709  
Moderator: asking me, when I click on it, what app I want to open it in, and it is not giving me, any of the correct options.  
42  
00:05:03.320 \--\> 00:05:04.000  
P4: \-Oh.  
43  
00:05:09.090 \--\> 00:05:10.670  
Moderator: I'm trying one more thing.  
44  
00:05:11.210 \--\> 00:05:11.870  
P4: Sure.  
45  
00:05:13.520 \--\> 00:05:15.550  
Moderator: Yep, download now.  
46  
00:05:23.700 \--\> 00:05:28.500  
Moderator: Let's see, I'm hitting… I'm hitting download now, nothing is happening…  
47  
00:06:05.910 \--\> 00:06:07.189  
P4: Did I lose you guys?  
48  
00:06:07.190 \--\> 00:06:07.750  
Moderator: Nope.  
49  
00:06:08.070 \--\> 00:06:08.780  
P4: That's go.  
50  
00:06:09.750 \--\> 00:06:17.000  
Moderator: Nope, still here. So, yeah, I'm not able to open it on my phone either, so I'm thinking we're having a technical problem with…  
51  
00:06:17.480 \--\> 00:06:25.409  
Moderator: that. I'm checking in with somebody on our team to see if there's a potential solution to it.  
52  
00:06:30.580 \--\> 00:06:43.279  
Moderator: Also, I, am gonna… there's a second, there's a second link that I am gonna try. It'll take me a second to find out, and then I will… I will get that to you and see if we have…  
53  
00:06:43.710 \--\> 00:06:45.520  
Moderator: If we have better luck.  
54  
00:06:46.270 \--\> 00:06:46.950  
P4: Okay.  
55  
00:06:57.630 \--\> 00:06:59.810  
Moderator: Could you please try that, like.  
56  
00:07:00.200 \--\> 00:07:01.870  
Moderator: That I just put in the chat.  
57  
00:07:08.840 \--\> 00:07:10.290  
P4: Okay, that one worked.  
58  
00:07:10.580 \--\> 00:07:17.839  
Moderator: Awesome. Okay, so… Sounds like it is just an issue with the one lake.  
59  
00:07:19.360 \--\> 00:07:26.789  
Moderator: Okay, great. So please share your screen, don't be stressed if it kicks you off Zoom,  
60  
00:07:28.150 \--\> 00:07:29.999  
Moderator: Because that happens sometimes.  
61  
00:07:33.520 \--\> 00:07:34.620  
P4: Let me…  
62  
00:07:57.330 \--\> 00:07:58.859  
P4: Okay, can you guys see?  
63  
00:07:59.200 \--\> 00:08:00.100  
Moderator: Yep.  
64  
00:08:00.830 \--\> 00:08:01.630  
P4: technology.  
65  
00:08:03.960 \--\> 00:08:07.110  
Moderator: Perfect. I'm seeing exactly what I expect to see.  
66  
00:08:08.670 \--\> 00:08:16.830  
Moderator: All right, so to get started, this is a tool for discovering and understanding benefits.  
67  
00:08:16.830 \--\> 00:08:33.390  
Moderator: And I'd like you to go through, use this, pretend I'm not here as far as, like, what you click on, but I would like you to share out loud what you're thinking, feeling, noticing, any issues that you run into, and any questions you have.  
68  
00:08:35.840 \--\> 00:08:36.549  
P4: Okay.  
69  
00:08:37.710 \--\> 00:08:47.480  
P4: Reading through it… Hope you find benefits you may want to apply for.  
70  
00:09:13.530 \--\> 00:09:14.879  
P4: Can I click on stuff?  
71  
00:09:15.320 \--\> 00:09:16.500  
Moderator: Yeah, go ahead.  
72  
00:09:16.630 \--\> 00:09:17.550  
Moderator: Mmm.  
73  
00:09:42.320 \--\> 00:09:43.609  
P4: Just gone through…  
74  
00:10:12.410 \--\> 00:10:15.469  
P4: So then it gives you, like, an overview of what you…  
75  
00:10:17.750 \--\> 00:10:26.390  
Moderator: Yeah, is… are you… Yeah, that's the intent. Are you seeing what you expect to see? Is there anything…  
76  
00:10:26.670 \--\> 00:10:30.970  
Moderator: That, you're surprised by, or that…  
77  
00:10:30.970 \--\> 00:10:31.330  
P4: Does it…  
78  
00:10:31.330 \--\> 00:10:32.370  
Moderator: Like, it's working?  
79  
00:10:34.180 \--\> 00:10:35.379  
P4: No, I'm,  
80  
00:10:36.240 \--\> 00:10:41.229  
P4: I'm not surprised, I'm… I'm interested to see where this goes. There was nothing like this today.  
81  
00:10:42.330 \--\> 00:10:43.310  
P4: Wow.  
82  
00:10:44.260 \--\> 00:10:52.389  
P4: So, like… None of this… is this kind of, like, consolidating the information for people?  
83  
00:10:52.800 \--\> 00:10:53.390  
Moderator: Yeah.  
84  
00:10:53.630 \--\> 00:11:00.010  
Moderator: Yeah, exactly. It's, it's for, it's for discovering benefits and…  
85  
00:11:00.340 \--\> 00:11:14.389  
Moderator: Well, I'll give you more answers about that after the test, but I'd love to see how you explore this. So, on this page, I'd like you to just, like, use this as if I weren't here.  
86  
00:11:15.670 \--\> 00:11:16.470  
P4: Okay.  
87  
00:11:19.100 \--\> 00:11:22.250  
P4: This kind of works out, because I'm actually,  
88  
00:11:23.950 \--\> 00:11:28.509  
P4: Like, I still have some GI Bill left, and I'll want to use it to do something  
89  
00:11:28.690 \--\> 00:11:30.300  
P4: For school, so…  
90  
00:11:30.620 \--\> 00:11:31.340  
Moderator: Great.  
91  
00:11:42.250 \--\> 00:11:48.370  
Moderator: So what are you noticing with the filters? Can you talk about why you chose the ones you did?  
92  
00:11:52.350 \--\> 00:11:54.909  
P4: So, this doesn't really apply to me yet.  
93  
00:11:59.270 \--\> 00:12:03.890  
P4: I don't know, I still don't know what all benefits I have under disability.  
94  
00:12:04.830 \--\> 00:12:10.629  
P4: I'm interested in education, because that's, you know, I still have GI Bill, and I want to see,  
95  
00:12:11.210 \--\> 00:12:13.339  
P4: You know, what options are for that.  
96  
00:12:14.040 \--\> 00:12:22.429  
P4: And then… you know, I'm always interested in what careers and employment… I know that, you know, the VA  
97  
00:12:22.640 \--\> 00:12:26.029  
P4: Has really good… Employment options, so…  
98  
00:12:27.680 \--\> 00:12:33.979  
P4: Those are the ones that most… I felt applied to me. I guess… These other ones…  
99  
00:12:34.610 \--\> 00:12:41.280  
P4: I could definitely see, you know, older veterans wanting more information on The burials, the housing assistance.  
100  
00:12:41.700 \--\> 00:12:45.560  
P4: Pension, but those ones just don't apply to me as much.  
101  
00:12:57.300 \--\> 00:13:00.839  
P4: One part… Filters, show results.  
102  
00:13:03.480 \--\> 00:13:06.849  
P4: Oh, is this when, like, it'll only show you…  
103  
00:13:07.830 \--\> 00:13:11.630  
P4: When you need… when you apply for these before separation?  
104  
00:13:13.040 \--\> 00:13:14.569  
P4: Or after secretion.  
105  
00:13:14.790 \--\> 00:13:16.830  
Moderator: What do you… what do you think it's saying?  
106  
00:13:18.430 \--\> 00:13:19.870  
P4: Well, I think it's saying…  
107  
00:13:21.350 \--\> 00:13:28.979  
P4: show me, like, if I need to apply before separation, show me these ones. If I need to apply after… if I can apply after separation, show me these.  
108  
00:13:28.980 \--\> 00:13:29.670  
Moderator: Yeah.  
109  
00:13:35.600 \--\> 00:13:42.429  
P4: I can tell you, the military does a terrible job at Explaining this information for people.  
110  
00:13:43.460 \--\> 00:13:46.089  
P4: So this before separation one…  
111  
00:13:48.100 \--\> 00:13:56.880  
P4: I don't know, I don't know anyone that did this stuff, like, prior to separating. I feel like most of this stuff gets told word of mouth.  
112  
00:13:56.880 \--\> 00:13:59.600  
Moderator: You know, somebody figures it out.  
113  
00:13:59.600 \--\> 00:14:04.350  
P4: And you're in school with, like, other veterans, and someone's like, hey, did you guys hear about this? And they're like, oh.  
114  
00:14:04.600 \--\> 00:14:05.919  
P4: I had no idea.  
115  
00:14:06.960 \--\> 00:14:09.449  
P4: Like, I took the transition course for the  
116  
00:14:10.530 \--\> 00:14:12.419  
P4: in the Marine Corps, and it was…  
117  
00:14:13.840 \--\> 00:14:21.050  
P4: Like, no useful information. It was like…  
118  
00:14:22.080 \--\> 00:14:25.519  
P4: You know, you'll need to wake up and brush your own teeth, and…  
119  
00:14:25.970 \--\> 00:14:29.240  
P4: Get a job, and it's like… Okay.  
120  
00:14:29.410 \--\> 00:14:33.669  
P4: None of this, kind of, like, what benefits you have when you get out.  
121  
00:14:36.210 \--\> 00:14:44.970  
Moderator: Yeah, that's… we can chat more about that at the end, but yeah, we've heard that a lot, and that's one of the reasons that this product exists.  
122  
00:15:04.090 \--\> 00:15:07.120  
P4: It gives you the forms and all the eligibility.  
123  
00:15:32.710 \--\> 00:15:35.900  
P4: If I hit this one, is it gonna take me all the way back?  
124  
00:15:37.020 \--\> 00:15:42.790  
Moderator: Oh… Go… go ahead and see what happens.  
125  
00:15:46.110 \--\> 00:15:47.710  
P4: Oh yeah, it took me all the way up.  
126  
00:16:04.520 \--\> 00:16:06.739  
P4: Is this the right screen? Is this what actually doesn't…  
127  
00:16:08.560 \--\> 00:16:12.290  
Moderator: Yeah, so this has actually taken you to,  
128  
00:16:13.320 \--\> 00:16:17.849  
Moderator: getting started with VA, not back to our…  
129  
00:16:17.980 \--\> 00:16:24.130  
Moderator: product for discovering your benefits. Yeah, if you could…  
130  
00:16:25.880 \--\> 00:16:34.470  
Moderator: Okay, so you are back on… I… you were just showing all of your tabs? It looks like,  
131  
00:16:36.820 \--\> 00:16:47.690  
Moderator: It, it looks… Could you go back to, the original tab that you were using? Please,  
132  
00:16:47.870 \--\> 00:16:56.559  
Moderator: And try, like, hitting the back button a few times, or, I actually can't… yeah, great. So the back button is active.  
133  
00:17:05.329 \--\> 00:17:09.270  
Moderator: So… okay, so it… so it worked.  
134  
00:17:09.400 \--\> 00:17:12.589  
Moderator: But it looks like… that this is…  
135  
00:17:12.960 \--\> 00:17:21.879  
Moderator: it wasn't behaving exactly like I expected to see it behaving, so, looks like this is something that we need to take another look at, how it's designed.  
136  
00:17:27.450 \--\> 00:17:32.680  
Moderator: Okay, so while you are scrolling, so it looks like you're,  
137  
00:17:35.040 \--\> 00:17:42.100  
Moderator: you're going through, kind of, benefit by benefit. How did you decide which benefit you wanted to click on first?  
138  
00:17:44.080 \--\> 00:17:47.530  
P4: Well, the first one, I just… I just went in the order.  
139  
00:17:48.810 \--\> 00:17:51.949  
P4: And then I clicked on the school one, because that's the…  
140  
00:17:52.180 \--\> 00:17:56.320  
P4: Like, that's what I'm most interested in right now, because I still have that…  
141  
00:17:56.880 \--\> 00:17:59.030  
P4: post-911 GI Bill I can use.  
142  
00:18:00.970 \--\> 00:18:12.370  
P4: And, again, this is something I went to… I found out more about… the GI Bill… from,  
143  
00:18:14.230 \--\> 00:18:19.959  
P4: like, going to the school and stuff getting, like, messed up for me, and that was from, like, the VA reps at the school.  
144  
00:18:20.410 \--\> 00:18:23.460  
P4: Like, they… they didn't know stuff, and then I'd start…  
145  
00:18:23.800 \--\> 00:18:27.340  
P4: like, oh, this can't be right, and then I look it up, and I'm like, yep.  
146  
00:18:27.530 \--\> 00:18:28.960  
P4: That's not right.  
147  
00:18:29.400 \--\> 00:18:32.840  
P4: Figure it out myself, so… .  
148  
00:18:41.270 \--\> 00:18:49.239  
Moderator: Yeah, so Vet Success on Campus, is that, the program that you used at the school? Like, the student veteran  
149  
00:18:49.370 \--\> 00:18:51.190  
Moderator: services office?  
150  
00:18:51.190 \--\> 00:18:57.550  
P4: Yeah, I went to the veteran's office there, and I walked in, and I had no idea about anything, and the guy that was there  
151  
00:18:58.360 \--\> 00:19:05.470  
P4: You know, he helped sign me up for classes, but he signed me up where I was, like.  
152  
00:19:06.790 \--\> 00:19:18.210  
P4: instead of, like, a traditional school, you know, where you go from one class to the next, he had spaced me out with these, like, two out… like, I would have been at the school from, like, 7 o'clock in the morning to 7 o'clock at night.  
153  
00:19:19.350 \--\> 00:19:20.130  
Moderator: Mmm.  
154  
00:19:20.130 \--\> 00:19:27.760  
P4: And he's like… and, you know, 4 classes spaced out every, you know, about 2 hours. And he's like, now you have time to study.  
155  
00:19:27.980 \--\> 00:19:29.699  
P4: In between, enough.  
156  
00:19:29.830 \--\> 00:19:32.870  
P4: And it just made no sense, and then…  
157  
00:19:34.000 \--\> 00:19:39.630  
P4: you know, I started looking into it, and I found, you know, they're like, you only need to have one in-person class, or…  
158  
00:19:40.450 \--\> 00:19:42.289  
P4: You don't need, you know…  
159  
00:19:42.410 \--\> 00:19:48.099  
P4: You don't have to go out to the… you know, you can do online classes, you don't have to go  
160  
00:19:49.100 \--\> 00:19:54.219  
P4: I think when I went to school, you had to have one person to get your benefits.  
161  
00:19:54.790 \--\> 00:19:56.520  
P4: And the rest could be online.  
162  
00:19:56.870 \--\> 00:20:01.239  
P4: But I had no idea, like, there was… none of this information was available.  
163  
00:20:02.910 \--\> 00:20:05.010  
P4: At least I didn't know where to look for it.  
164  
00:20:05.920 \--\> 00:20:08.100  
P4: And then the people who I thought would know it.  
165  
00:20:10.120 \--\> 00:20:15.229  
P4: Didn't know either, apparently, because… My first,  
166  
00:20:15.460 \--\> 00:20:22.709  
P4: semester, I went and had to change all my classes, because I just was like, this is ridiculous, I can't spend an entire day at the school.  
167  
00:20:24.050 \--\> 00:20:25.990  
Moderator: Yeah, was that right after you separated?  
168  
00:20:25.990 \--\> 00:20:31.149  
P4: Yeah, that was, like, 2 months after I got out of the Marine Corps, I went and signed up for school.  
169  
00:20:34.100 \--\> 00:20:47.999  
Moderator: So going back to, like, the navigation for this, were you expecting when you hit the back button earlier that you would have to fill out the form again, or did you think the link would be there?  
170  
00:20:48.300 \--\> 00:20:49.549  
P4: No, I thought it would be there.  
171  
00:21:10.460 \--\> 00:21:16.490  
Moderator: So we had a choice to make when we were putting the links on the page of whether to go  
172  
00:21:16.710 \--\> 00:21:21.000  
Moderator: To this page that explains the benefit, versus…  
173  
00:21:21.680 \--\> 00:21:25.979  
Moderator: the application for the benefit. Do you think we made the right choice?  
174  
00:21:26.560 \--\> 00:21:34.520  
P4: Yeah, because there are those people that want to use the… The different…  
175  
00:21:35.990 \--\> 00:21:41.100  
P4: the, you mean, like, between… like, explaining all the benefits, like the Montgomery and the…  
176  
00:21:41.920 \--\> 00:21:49.970  
P4: Yeah, I would think this is definitely the right choice, because I know people that have no idea the difference. Like, they get out and they have no idea that if a swim is good.  
177  
00:21:50.690 \--\> 00:22:10.619  
Moderator: Yeah, it sounds like you're pretty connected with, like, other veterans, people you served with, that you're getting a lot of information that way. Is there anything that you've noticed so far about the tool that you think, could make it better for other people?  
178  
00:22:10.850 \--\> 00:22:12.840  
Moderator: Like, maybe those who are getting…  
179  
00:22:13.340 \--\> 00:22:17.610  
Moderator: Who are, who are just separating, or, you know, just starting civilian life.  
180  
00:22:25.970 \--\> 00:22:28.869  
P4: Can you say that last part of the question one more time?  
181  
00:22:29.370 \--\> 00:22:39.009  
Moderator: Actually, I'm gonna hold that till the end. I just realized I might be distracting you from getting the information you want, so we can go back to that question at the end.  
182  
00:22:39.010 \--\> 00:22:39.660  
P4: Okay.  
183  
00:22:47.660 \--\> 00:22:56.570  
P4: There was one thing… That… I remember when I was going to school that I thought  
184  
00:22:57.270 \--\> 00:23:00.320  
P4: Wasn't explained the best.  
185  
00:23:00.570 \--\> 00:23:04.249  
P4: And it was how much money you're actually going to get, like, in a semester.  
186  
00:23:05.210 \--\> 00:23:11.690  
P4: You know, like, say you start school, school starts January, 20th, I think.  
187  
00:23:13.700 \--\> 00:23:20.159  
P4: And I think a lot of people were expecting they were gonna get BAH January through May, or whatever.  
188  
00:23:20.810 \--\> 00:23:25.050  
P4: And it's prorated for the one week that you go to school in January.  
189  
00:23:28.500 \--\> 00:23:35.270  
P4: And that was not… like, I had no idea about any of that. I was expecting… I was fully expecting to get…  
190  
00:23:36.390 \--\> 00:23:40.900  
P4: you know, a check so that I could pay bills and stuff, and then it was, like, a check for…  
191  
00:23:41.100 \--\> 00:23:45.190  
P4: I forget however much, probably, like, $300 for the month, and…  
192  
00:23:46.080 \--\> 00:23:51.179  
P4: I remember that being a thing, like, if… You know, the school wasn't…  
193  
00:23:52.400 \--\> 00:23:55.749  
P4: The whole month. You weren't paid for the whole month.  
194  
00:23:56.130 \--\> 00:24:02.640  
P4: And every semester does end… like, you only have, like, 3 months that you're actually making the full amount.  
195  
00:24:04.720 \--\> 00:24:07.289  
P4: And then I did summer school, too.  
196  
00:24:08.160 \--\> 00:24:13.980  
P4: Which I think was… Like, there was 4-week summer school classes and 8-week summer school classes.  
197  
00:24:16.670 \--\> 00:24:21.790  
P4: And that's only, I think, full-time for summer schools only…  
198  
00:24:23.480 \--\> 00:24:36.499  
P4: I think it might have only been 4 credits, because if of the 4-week class or 8-week class, I think it was, like, 4 credits or 6 credits to put you full-time, and I had no idea about that either, and there… like, that I had to find out from…  
199  
00:24:36.610 \--\> 00:24:41.440  
P4: Calling around and figuring out what qualified me as full-time for summer school.  
200  
00:24:41.790 \--\> 00:24:48.019  
P4: And I think a lot more veterans would be willing to do that over the… like, do summer school and, you know, get ahead.  
201  
00:24:48.810 \--\> 00:24:53.910  
P4: Okay, you only have to do one full-time class over the summer. To be full-time, it's just gonna be 4 weeks.  
202  
00:24:55.600 \--\> 00:24:58.829  
Moderator: Yeah, that sounds like really important information that should be.  
203  
00:24:58.830 \--\> 00:24:59.390  
P4: Food.  
204  
00:24:59.760 \--\> 00:25:04.009  
Moderator: You know, more widely known that should be included here.  
205  
00:25:04.880 \--\> 00:25:07.979  
P4: And I've seen they have on here, they do explain the probation  
206  
00:25:08.100 \--\> 00:25:14.680  
P4: Pro-rated rates for us, like, okay, if you only take 9 credits and then 12 credits at the time, you'll only get, you know, 80%.  
207  
00:25:15.010 \--\> 00:25:22.099  
P4: But it doesn't explain, like, hey, if you're not in school January 1st to January 31st, you're not getting paid for that month.  
208  
00:25:24.470 \--\> 00:25:34.059  
Moderator: Yeah. So I want to move this along to going back to the page with all the results, because I have a couple questions about navigation.  
209  
00:25:34.300 \--\> 00:25:37.040  
P4: Yeah, let me… Alright.  
210  
00:25:40.720 \--\> 00:25:49.220  
Moderator: So, looking at this, how… how do you think that these are sorted? How do you think, like, the order is decided?  
211  
00:25:51.210 \--\> 00:25:52.220  
P4: Boom.  
212  
00:26:03.460 \--\> 00:26:06.189  
P4: Well, I think it's from what I clicked.  
213  
00:26:08.660 \--\> 00:26:14.280  
P4: Because I see… I purchased, like, this one…  
214  
00:26:15.460 \--\> 00:26:20.229  
P4: This one, I'm a little… I didn't think I clicked something that applied to that.  
215  
00:26:21.860 \--\> 00:26:23.149  
Moderator: Do you have disability?  
216  
00:26:23.710 \--\> 00:26:25.130  
P4: For the housing grant?  
217  
00:26:26.730 \--\> 00:26:29.670  
Moderator: Maybe, oh, I guess that does under a disability, okay.  
218  
00:26:30.020 \--\> 00:26:33.199  
P4: See, I didn't even know those two were connected, so I'm glad that came up.  
219  
00:26:34.720 \--\> 00:26:39.479  
P4: The education one…  
220  
00:26:45.460 \--\> 00:26:46.779  
P4: This is…  
221  
00:26:47.430 \--\> 00:26:58.210  
P4: I have no idea the rhyme or reason why they came up, but they all look like they would apply to me, because some of these, I had no idea. Like, after this, I'm probably gonna go look them up when I get more time.  
222  
00:26:59.050 \--\> 00:27:01.000  
P4: State Veterans Benefits.  
223  
00:27:02.180 \--\> 00:27:04.109  
P4: The healthcare…  
224  
00:27:14.410 \--\> 00:27:22.500  
Moderator: So, while you're scrolling, what are you noticing first about the… like, how are you… how are you navigating? What are you noticing first on the cards?  
225  
00:27:23.780 \--\> 00:27:28.380  
P4: the bold black letters, probably what I'm hosting first.  
226  
00:27:28.680 \--\> 00:27:30.650  
P4: And then the subcategory?  
227  
00:27:31.240 \--\> 00:27:36.020  
P4: I will say they are kind of jumping around, like…  
228  
00:27:36.850 \--\> 00:27:39.970  
P4: GI bills, education, and then way down here.  
229  
00:27:45.380 \--\> 00:27:50.589  
P4: This is another, you know… Cause this, I forget, what do they call this one?  
230  
00:27:53.570 \--\> 00:27:55.969  
Moderator: DR\&E? Or.  
231  
00:27:55.970 \--\> 00:27:59.210  
P4: They had another name for it, I forget, maybe the old name that they used to…  
232  
00:27:59.210 \--\> 00:28:00.859  
Moderator: Chapter 22, I think?  
233  
00:28:00.860 \--\> 00:28:01.380  
P4: Huge.  
234  
00:28:01.380 \--\> 00:28:02.310  
Moderator: Yeah.  
235  
00:28:02.510 \--\> 00:28:06.359  
P4: They used to have a different name for it, but like, I would…  
236  
00:28:06.780 \--\> 00:28:14.759  
P4: Kinda expect to see, like, my post-911, this, this probably, all in, like, one after the other, or maybe, like.  
237  
00:28:15.380 \--\> 00:28:24.119  
P4: What might be a little easier is if you got… Like, this was… Like, you click on…  
238  
00:28:25.360 \--\> 00:28:41.450  
P4: say, disability, and then once you click on disability, you get everything that applies to disability, and then, like, instead of all these separate ones, you just have, like, the three that I clicked, like, disability, education, benefits, and then I click on Education, it has all those.  
239  
00:28:41.600 \--\> 00:28:43.200  
Moderator: Kind of helping.  
240  
00:28:45.910 \--\> 00:28:48.559  
P4: Organize these maybe a little better.  
241  
00:28:51.430 \--\> 00:28:54.230  
Moderator: So, what…  
242  
00:28:55.560 \--\> 00:29:07.339  
Moderator: a question related to that. So, you selected disability and, I believe, healthcare and education in your goals, and then,  
243  
00:29:08.080 \--\> 00:29:22.499  
Moderator: But then you also did it again in the filters, and now the filters have been removed after you, after you clicked back to this page. It sounds like, A, you were expecting the filters to stick, which, you know, they…  
244  
00:29:22.580 \--\> 00:29:38.500  
Moderator: they should have, that's, something that I think we need to change about this prototype. But then, B, it sounds like seeing all of the goals together is, a lot of information.  
245  
00:29:38.830 \--\> 00:29:41.069  
P4: Yeah, I use a lot of information.  
246  
00:30:24.630 \--\> 00:30:26.920  
P4: So, if I were to click these,  
247  
00:30:27.540 \--\> 00:30:31.090  
P4: Like, if I just click disability, will it just bring up disability?  
248  
00:30:31.540 \--\> 00:30:33.929  
Moderator: Yeah, go ahead and, and see what happens.  
249  
00:30:39.190 \--\> 00:30:45.210  
P4: So, what's interesting is it just brought up the disability compensation, it didn't bring up the, housing.  
250  
00:30:48.140 \--\> 00:30:52.220  
Moderator: Yeah, that… that… that is interesting.  
251  
00:30:54.170 \--\> 00:31:02.700  
P4: Alright, book education… Well, let's see, for education, it brought up the GI Bill, and…  
252  
00:31:03.100 \--\> 00:31:07.680  
P4: the V, R, and E, but it didn't bring up the student success.  
253  
00:31:09.550 \--\> 00:31:11.609  
P4: So you're not getting the complete  
254  
00:31:15.970 \--\> 00:31:16.960  
P4: Let's see…  
255  
00:31:16.960 \--\> 00:31:20.229  
Moderator: Yeah, the VSOC, like you were talking about earlier.  
256  
00:31:22.210 \--\> 00:31:23.500  
Moderator: Oh, there it is\!  
257  
00:31:23.500 \--\> 00:31:25.410  
P4: Yeah, it's under careers and Employment.  
258  
00:31:26.000 \--\> 00:31:26.710  
Moderator: Hmm.  
259  
00:31:32.960 \--\> 00:31:33.580  
P4: Hmm.  
260  
00:31:42.680 \--\> 00:31:57.270  
Moderator: So I'd like you to scroll up to, right under filters, where it says show results, recommended for you versus all results. Did you see that at first?  
261  
00:31:58.790 \--\> 00:31:59.789  
P4: I did, yes.  
262  
00:31:59.790 \--\> 00:32:01.920  
Moderator: Yeah,  
263  
00:32:03.310 \--\> 00:32:14.199  
Moderator: And, yeah, I noticed you choose… you chose to have recommended for you stay on. Do you have interest in… in clicking that to see all results, or no?  
264  
00:32:14.830 \--\> 00:32:15.390  
P4: Yeah.  
265  
00:32:22.210 \--\> 00:32:23.390  
P4: I bet y'all\!  
266  
00:32:30.170 \--\> 00:32:31.979  
P4: There's a lot more that come up.  
267  
00:32:36.960 \--\> 00:32:43.479  
Moderator: What's your theory about why things are recommended or not recommended?  
268  
00:32:45.040 \--\> 00:32:49.300  
P4: Probably based off of those questions I answered at the beginning.  
269  
00:32:50.210 \--\> 00:32:50.590  
Moderator: Yeah.  
270  
00:32:50.590 \--\> 00:32:52.800  
P4: Like, how long I've been separated…  
271  
00:32:53.030 \--\> 00:32:54.749  
P4: What brand, you know, all that.  
272  
00:32:55.420 \--\> 00:32:58.069  
P4: I would assume makes the recommended for me.  
273  
00:32:59.040 \--\> 00:33:04.100  
P4: The part that I really think is gonna trip some people up is gonna be this when to apply, because I'm…  
274  
00:33:04.840 \--\> 00:33:13.039  
P4: I'm really confident this will… be what, like, 99% of people are gonna have to select, because…  
275  
00:33:13.510 \--\> 00:33:18.070  
P4: The military is not gonna help people with this before separation peace.  
276  
00:33:19.600 \--\> 00:33:27.910  
Moderator: Actually, you might be interested to know that we are doing a pilot where, separating service members are going to see this in TAPS.  
277  
00:33:28.620 \--\> 00:33:32.290  
P4: Yeah, that would be… This should be…  
278  
00:33:32.700 \--\> 00:33:38.880  
P4: like, people don't need to know how to brush their teeth and, you know, eat breakfast on their own. This should be what taps is…  
279  
00:33:39.010 \--\> 00:33:44.039  
P4: Doing, not any of the other… Nonsense. Now, this would make…  
280  
00:33:44.460 \--\> 00:33:46.009  
P4: It'd be a lot more helpful.  
281  
00:33:50.990 \--\> 00:34:01.529  
Moderator: So, when you were going through the filters, could you scroll back to those? I noticed that, I didn't see you click on apply.  
282  
00:34:02.130 \--\> 00:34:09.550  
Moderator: Were you… were you assuming that the filters were going to… automatically.  
283  
00:34:11.139 \--\> 00:34:14.189  
Moderator: happen? Or did you click and I just didn't see it?  
284  
00:34:14.190 \--\> 00:34:15.399  
P4: I did click.  
285  
00:34:15.409 \--\> 00:34:22.009  
Moderator: Okay, because I noticed the filters started working, and I know that can't happen without clicking.  
286  
00:34:22.010 \--\> 00:34:24.739  
P4: I… yeah, I did click,  
287  
00:34:25.570 \--\> 00:34:27.770  
P4: I might have done it really fast, but…  
288  
00:34:56.260 \--\> 00:35:05.519  
Moderator: Oh… Yeah, so one more thing, I am,  
289  
00:35:06.600 \--\> 00:35:19.699  
Moderator: The default way that this is sorted is by, it is by timing. Whether or not it's time sensitive, whether there's a deadline for applying.  
290  
00:35:19.710 \--\> 00:35:28.690  
Moderator: At this point, being several years into working with VA, are you expecting there to be deadlines of when you can apply to things?  
291  
00:35:32.940 \--\> 00:35:40.009  
P4: I always thought there was a deadline. I think there used to be a deadline for when you could apply for,  
292  
00:35:40.200 \--\> 00:35:41.440  
P4: Education.  
293  
00:35:43.870 \--\> 00:35:47.319  
P4: So, I was fully expecting there to be deadlines.  
294  
00:35:47.930 \--\> 00:35:53.790  
Moderator: Okay, yeah, and did you see where that's listed on the card for GI Bill?  
295  
00:35:55.490 \--\> 00:35:57.829  
Moderator: The first time you were scrolling through.  
296  
00:35:57.830 \--\> 00:35:59.190  
P4: No, I didn't.  
297  
00:35:59.190 \--\> 00:36:00.120  
Moderator: Okay.  
298  
00:36:03.050 \--\> 00:36:12.270  
Moderator: Do they still… is there still a deadline for GM? Not for people who separated after 2013, and it sounds like that isn't you.  
299  
00:36:12.740 \--\> 00:36:13.410  
P4: Okay.  
300  
00:36:13.720 \--\> 00:36:29.830  
Moderator: Now it's a lifetime benefit, but for anybody who separated before January 1st, 2013, there is a 15-year deadline. So, that's applying to fewer and fewer people these days, but still, it's,  
301  
00:36:30.010 \--\> 00:36:32.380  
Moderator: Yeah, anybody who separated before then.  
302  
00:36:32.780 \--\> 00:36:33.740  
P4: Okay.  
303  
00:36:36.690 \--\> 00:36:42.929  
Moderator: Okay, so, we can wrap up this part of the test. I have a couple of follow-up questions for you.  
304  
00:36:43.070 \--\> 00:36:44.000  
P4: Okay.  
305  
00:36:44.000 \--\> 00:36:45.759  
Moderator: Get back to my notes…  
306  
00:36:47.050 \--\> 00:36:50.040  
P4: Yeah, cause I'll have to go here soon.  
307  
00:36:50.040 \--\> 00:36:52.369  
Moderator: Oh, yeah, of course.  
308  
00:36:57.920 \--\> 00:37:15.369  
Moderator: So, I know you've, you've said some things about how, this tool would be helpful for somebody who's transitioning from active duty, and, it sounds like you think that it would, for you, in your life today, is this helpful?  
309  
00:37:16.070 \--\> 00:37:23.089  
P4: I think it is, because it's consolidating information, and it's present… like, I hadn't… I didn't even know about some of these things.  
310  
00:37:24.690 \--\> 00:37:28.109  
P4: And I worked… I even worked at the veteran's office at my school.  
311  
00:37:29.210 \--\> 00:37:32.060  
P4: And I had no idea some of these things are out there.  
312  
00:37:34.500 \--\> 00:37:38.149  
Moderator: What would you give this tool? 1 to 5?  
313  
00:37:38.290 \--\> 00:37:40.760  
Moderator: For satisfaction, for quality.  
314  
00:37:42.360 \--\> 00:37:43.889  
P4: It's won the highest.  
315  
00:37:44.300 \--\> 00:37:45.370  
Moderator: 5's the highest.  
316  
00:37:45.780 \--\> 00:37:54.010  
P4: I mean, 4? I mean, it's consolidated information. Some of the stuff… Just 4 for…  
317  
00:37:55.640 \--\> 00:37:58.460  
P4: Some of the things, like,  
318  
00:37:58.790 \--\> 00:38:02.889  
P4: you know, not everything in education shows up when you hit Apply Filter, you have to.  
319  
00:38:03.560 \--\> 00:38:08.820  
P4: kind of have multiple things, or… that would be the only thing I see.  
320  
00:38:11.950 \--\> 00:38:29.240  
Moderator: what, what would you want to change about it besides… besides that? Like, it sounds like the SOC, you were expecting to see that in education. It sounds like you were expecting to see it sorted by type of benefit versus what you should apply to first.  
321  
00:38:29.240 \--\> 00:38:29.810  
P4: Yeah.  
322  
00:38:29.810 \--\> 00:38:33.010  
Moderator: Any, anything else that you noticed?  
323  
00:38:41.360 \--\> 00:38:42.060  
P4: Hmm.  
324  
00:38:47.690 \--\> 00:38:51.940  
P4: You don't really think anything… I am.  
325  
00:38:54.590 \--\> 00:39:13.619  
Moderator: So, yeah, I know you have to go in a minute, so we can wrap up. I want to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable if we shared a clip with our partners, with your organization. Yeah, is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?  
326  
00:39:13.870 \--\> 00:39:14.470  
P4: Nope.  
327  
00:39:15.190 \--\> 00:39:35.089  
Moderator: Okay, so yeah, we really appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with us today, and your feedback is so helpful. Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans to give them a chance to participate in future research studies, and it sounds like you have a great network of veterans, so…  
328  
00:39:35.090 \--\> 00:39:45.300  
Moderator: Yeah, it would be great if you pass that on, and unless you have any questions for me, we can wrap up, and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.  
329  
00:39:45.870 \--\> 00:39:47.269  
P4: No, that's it. Thank you so much.  
330  
00:39:47.270 \--\> 00:39:48.310  
Moderator: Yeah, thank you.
