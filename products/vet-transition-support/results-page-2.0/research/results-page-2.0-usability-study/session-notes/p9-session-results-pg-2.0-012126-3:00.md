| Questionnaire observations | Pretty good understanding of what each of the goals covers, except for plan for my and my family's future Likes the helper text for service question Likes the options for \# of years Doesn't think the separation years represent everyone \-- why is 3+ years the highest amount? are people outside that not eligible?

Card content \- bold is name of program, then quick description This is the beginning of your search. Vet preference link didn't do what she expected \-- expected page within VA.gov that would tell her more about it and then give more links or at least tell her it would take her to OPM (You are leaving VA.gov warning) Expected it to open in new tab Link \- learn more vs apply \- would prefer both links because she prefers less clicks |

P9: Yes.  
4  
00:00:25.670 \--\> 00:00:33.089  
Moderator And you have already said you would not like to share a clip with your partners, or with our VA partners. Could you please confirm that?  
5

P9: No video clip, please. Thank you.  
6  
00:00:36.060 \--\> 00:00:36.810  
Moderator Excellent.  
7  
00:00:37.620 \--\> 00:00:48.010  
Moderator So, let's get into our interview. A couple of questions before we get started with the prototype. What surfaces do you use on VA.gov?  
8  
00:00:49.910 \--\> 00:00:51.599  
P9: I'm sorry, one more time, services?  
9  
00:00:51.600 \--\> 00:00:54.069  
Moderator What services do you use on VA.gov?  
10  
00:00:54.780 \--\> 00:00:59.050  
P9: I use the eBenefits, I use the Health.  
11  
00:00:59.050 \--\> 00:01:01.179  
Moderator portion…  
12  
00:01:01.180 \--\> 00:01:05.679  
P9: And, like, I often use the letter and documents as well.  
13  
00:01:06.490 \--\> 00:01:10.960  
P9: And I've used it to, like, follow my claim.  
14  
00:01:14.490 \--\> 00:01:19.030  
Moderator Have you, about how often would you say you log into the site?  
15  
00:01:22.000 \--\> 00:01:25.450  
P9: Before my claim, it was probably, like.  
16  
00:01:25.790 \--\> 00:01:40.059  
P9: weekly, now that I, like, already have a percentage and it's increased way less, I don't know, I've been checking it more because I've been having more health appointments, so…  
17  
00:01:40.060 \--\> 00:01:40.470  
Moderator Hmm?  
18  
00:01:40.470 \--\> 00:01:45.400  
P9: I would say… Legally now, as well? Yeah.  
19  
00:01:46.120 \--\> 00:01:46.730  
Moderator Yeah.  
20  
00:01:51.540 \--\> 00:01:57.169  
Moderator Yeah, if you've been using VA.gov since eBenefits, it's changed quite a lot, huh?  
21  
00:01:57.760 \--\> 00:01:59.760  
P9: A lot, yeah.  
22  
00:02:02.750 \--\> 00:02:14.899  
Moderator So, I have got a link in the chat, it's pinned, but let me know if you're not seeing it. It starts with, HTTPS, redesigned space chainsaw, do you see…  
23  
00:02:15.430 \--\> 00:02:16.360  
P9: I don't see a link.  
24  
00:02:16.380 \--\> 00:02:19.360  
Moderator Okay, let me… let me post it again.  
25  
00:02:19.560 \--\> 00:02:20.430  
P9: Okay.  
26  
00:02:25.970 \--\> 00:02:27.279  
Moderator Okay, just a minute.  
27  
00:02:35.410 \--\> 00:02:36.880  
Moderator You should see it now.  
28  
00:02:37.320 \--\> 00:02:38.969  
P9: Okay, perfect.  
29  
00:02:42.560 \--\> 00:02:52.900  
Moderator So, I'd like you to click on it, and then share your screen. And, because you're on mobile, sometimes Zoom is a little funny, you might get disconnected. If you do.  
30  
00:02:53.070 \--\> 00:02:56.999  
Moderator it's a… it's a known problem. Oh, you know what?  
31  
00:02:59.170 \--\> 00:03:15.090  
Moderator Okay, I am recording, sorry, didn't see the light for a second. Okay, yeah, sometimes you might, it might kick you off Zoom. It's a known problem, so if you do happen to get disconnected, you can, you can just rejoin.  
32  
00:03:15.630 \--\> 00:03:16.460  
P9: Okay.  
33  
00:03:16.580 \--\> 00:03:19.140  
P9: And I'll share my screen now.  
34  
00:03:20.920 \--\> 00:03:24.299  
P9: Put my phone on don't disturb…  
35  
00:03:50.670 \--\> 00:03:53.909  
Moderator Great, that looks exactly right. That's what you should be seeing.  
36  
00:03:53.910 \--\> 00:03:54.570  
P9: Okay.  
37  
00:03:54.770 \--\> 00:04:13.340  
Moderator So what I'd like you to do for this part of the test is, for you to use this tool for discovering your benefits at VA, just like you would if I weren't here. I'd like you to see what you're thinking, feeling, and noticing as you go, especially if something feels off or you run into a problem.  
38  
00:04:13.340 \--\> 00:04:20.330  
Moderator I will have some questions for you along the way, and you can feel free to ask me questions, but I might hold the answer until the end.  
39  
00:04:20.610 \--\> 00:04:24.469  
Moderator So when you're ready, you can go ahead and get started.  
40  
00:04:25.490 \--\> 00:04:32.529  
P9: Okay… Okay, what goals do you want to accomplish?  
41  
00:04:39.830 \--\> 00:04:40.550  
P9: \-Oh.  
42  
00:04:40.730 \--\> 00:04:42.940  
P9: Go back to school…  
43  
00:04:49.760 \--\> 00:04:54.149  
P9: And you're wanting to know my thoughts as I click through and look at all this stuff?  
44  
00:04:54.150 \--\> 00:04:54.660  
Moderator Yeah.  
45  
00:04:54.670 \--\> 00:05:03.819  
P9: I really like the language around this. Like, what goals do you want to accomplish? It sounds collaborative.  
46  
00:05:03.940 \--\> 00:05:10.740  
P9: Like, okay, like, I have to do something, you all are gonna do something for me, like, it feels like…  
47  
00:05:11.030 \--\> 00:05:16.140  
P9: That type of thing, understand my benefits plan from…  
48  
00:05:18.220 \--\> 00:05:28.849  
P9: Yeah, like, all of these are very clear to, like, I can tell, like, what this would lead to. I'd go back to school, this would be, like, the REP, or, like.  
49  
00:05:28.850 \--\> 00:05:39.330  
P9: you know, your GI bills, stuff like that, start a new career. That might lead to that as well, like VR stuff, or, like, the rehabilitation.  
50  
00:05:39.340 \--\> 00:05:54.679  
P9: Healthcare, that might be, like, disability claims, or just healthcare in general. Understanding my benefits, like, talking to somebody about what you're eligible for, and then planning for my or my family's future.  
51  
00:05:54.680 \--\> 00:06:05.490  
P9: That could be, like, planning for, like, your estate, your will, health, or maybe even adding people to your family? I'm not…  
52  
00:06:05.510 \--\> 00:06:10.110  
P9: That one… that one could be… that one's probably, like, the Vegas to me, or…  
53  
00:06:10.150 \--\> 00:06:20.050  
P9: But plan for my transition or retirement, that one's, very clear. I'm, like, getting out of the military,  
54  
00:06:22.670 \--\> 00:06:34.340  
P9: And then get financial support for a service-connected condition. Oh, that one is disability, clearly. I would then take care of my health and well-being. That's probably just, like, general health stuff.  
55  
00:06:36.060 \--\> 00:06:42.920  
P9: So yeah, I feel like those are very clear in language, but plan for my and my family's future, I'm not sure what that would lead to.  
56  
00:06:43.360 \--\> 00:06:50.509  
Moderator Yeah. When you think about plan for my family's future, would you expect to see benefits that your family could apply for, or no?  
57  
00:06:50.820 \--\> 00:06:51.620  
P9: Yes.  
58  
00:06:51.760 \--\> 00:06:52.739  
Moderator You would. Okay.  
59  
00:06:55.960 \--\> 00:06:58.449  
Moderator Alright, when you're ready, you can hit continue.  
60  
00:06:58.960 \--\> 00:06:59.710  
P9: Okay.  
61  
00:07:03.030 \--\> 00:07:07.794  
P9: Total… 18…  
62  
00:07:11.510 \--\> 00:07:15.930  
P9: Okay, that's helpful, that little, like, subtext down there.  
63  
00:07:16.890 \--\> 00:07:19.429  
Moderator About if you've served multiple periods?  
64  
00:07:19.430 \--\> 00:07:21.029  
P9: Yeah, that's helpful.  
65  
00:07:22.090 \--\> 00:07:24.990  
Moderator Do these categories seem about right?  
66  
00:07:30.860 \--\> 00:07:37.920  
P9: Yeah, because typically, like, okay, I know somebody who  
67  
00:07:38.470 \--\> 00:07:50.980  
P9: for example, he didn't even go through basic training, but he was injured while he was, like, in, like, MEPS and, like, the processing, and so he was able to get disability  
68  
00:07:50.980 \--\> 00:08:04.720  
P9: And… and leave the military with, you know, with a medical discharge. And so, less than 4 months would make sense. 4 to 3 years, that could be, like, an active duty, like, one term, somebody who just got in, got out.  
69  
00:08:04.720 \--\> 00:08:15.070  
P9: 3 to 8… 3 to 10 years, that's somebody who is probably, like, a reservist, slash, they know that they want to do more years active duty. They've done at least…  
70  
00:08:15.070 \--\> 00:08:29.329  
P9: Two, like, terms in the military as active duty, one on my behalf, because I did 8 years in the reserves, and then 10 to 20 years are typically people who retire, 20 or more.  
71  
00:08:29.330 \--\> 00:08:44.709  
P9: Again, that's, like, that… that retirement age. So these are pretty accurate, I would say, and I think people would be able to see themselves a lot in these ranges. I wouldn't… I wouldn't do more than this, honestly. You could probably even get it down to  
72  
00:08:44.710 \--\> 00:08:52.659  
P9: just the 4, because 10… 10 years to less… or 20 years… oh, 20 years or more? No, that makes sense, because, like, the…  
73  
00:08:52.940 \--\> 00:08:57.030  
P9: generals and people who are, like, really up there. Yeah, it is perfect.  
74  
00:08:57.570 \--\> 00:08:59.329  
Moderator Great, good to hear it.  
75  
00:08:59.450 \--\> 00:09:02.319  
Moderator Okay, whenever you're ready, you can go on.  
76  
00:09:02.320 \--\> 00:09:03.090  
P9: Okay.  
77  
00:09:04.930 \--\> 00:09:05.990  
P9: And…  
78  
00:09:09.150 \--\> 00:09:15.520  
P9: Which branch should you search? Select all that apply, that makes sense.  
79  
00:09:17.510 \--\> 00:09:25.649  
P9: component, okay, because, yeah, I was gonna say, okay, I was wondering if they were gonna break that down, if that makes sense. Reserve…  
80  
00:09:27.610 \--\> 00:09:29.400  
P9: More than ever…  
81  
00:09:36.220 \--\> 00:09:38.370  
P9: Subtitles helpful.  
82  
00:09:39.520 \--\> 00:09:42.480  
P9: Currently serving in the military, no…  
83  
00:09:52.890 \--\> 00:09:58.710  
P9: Hmm… Oh, that was 2020… 6 years ago now.  
84  
00:10:01.440 \--\> 00:10:05.939  
P9: Hmm, how long ago did you separate or retire from service?  
85  
00:10:10.770 \--\> 00:10:13.090  
P9: Huh, I wonder about the…  
86  
00:10:15.110 \--\> 00:10:28.009  
P9: what was the word I'm looking for? Like, the granular approach to these? Like, 0 to 3 months, 4 to 6, 7 to 1, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 plus?  
87  
00:10:28.810 \--\> 00:10:36.620  
P9: Just because, like, I know, like, veterans, and especially in the program that I was in, like, there's a lot of people who get  
88  
00:10:36.790 \--\> 00:10:45.699  
P9: They'll be in benefits for a while, and then they might get, like, disconnected, or something will happen in life, and then they'll get disconnected, and so, like.  
89  
00:10:45.930 \--\> 00:10:51.430  
P9: the 3-plus years is where I know a lot of people to be at, because…  
90  
00:10:51.430 \--\> 00:11:12.929  
P9: again, like, that reconnection to services, or even if you didn't know that you were eligible for services, like, that's… a lot of vets, you know, they don't know, or they think that they're not eligible for anything, because they didn't do as much time, or they didn't… they didn't deploy, or anything like that. So, I just wonder behind this, if you could catch…  
91  
00:11:13.330 \--\> 00:11:17.170  
P9: More people, who were further removed.  
92  
00:11:17.550 \--\> 00:11:18.830  
Moderator In this answer.  
93  
00:11:19.000 \--\> 00:11:34.020  
Moderator Do you think, do you think the way we're asking this question makes it seem like we're not being welcome to people who have been, who have been veterans for a long time versus people who are currently transitioning?  
94  
00:11:35.190 \--\> 00:11:43.120  
P9: Yeah, this… it kind of excludes them a little bit. Like, the 3-plus years is kind of like… I won't say throwaway years, but…  
95  
00:11:45.240 \--\> 00:11:49.120  
P9: it just doesn't… I feel like it just doesn't capture  
96  
00:11:49.320 \--\> 00:11:55.110  
P9: That demographic, like, we could be leaving… leaving them out in a way that's really important.  
97  
00:11:57.330 \--\> 00:12:02.199  
Moderator Yeah, that's,  
98  
00:12:02.920 \--\> 00:12:11.979  
Moderator this is a really interesting perspective, and this is a great insight, because I don't think we'd… we hadn't thought about it that way.  
99  
00:12:12.950 \--\> 00:12:29.799  
Moderator You know, because, like, the granularity is to pair people with benefits that are for people who, who are transitioning, and then anyone who's been out 3 years or more, is eligible for basically the same things.  
100  
00:12:29.800 \--\> 00:12:30.230  
P9: Hmm…  
101  
00:12:30.230 \--\> 00:12:36.900  
Moderator based on their service. So, what do you think would feel more welcoming?  
102  
00:12:39.550 \--\> 00:12:45.610  
P9: I would even say… Maybe just, like…  
103  
00:12:45.760 \--\> 00:13:03.960  
P9: 3 to 10 years? Just… okay, I'm thinking… I'm thinking specifically about the homeless population, I guess. That's… that's kind of the population that popped up for me, was, like, people who… they could even still have their services, or even their money and their VA stuff.  
104  
00:13:04.340 \--\> 00:13:17.419  
P9: they have all of that stuff, but if they lose a social security card, or they become homeless, or something like that, or they lose connection to even people who can help them manage those services,  
105  
00:13:17.800 \--\> 00:13:24.269  
P9: Coming back to this, or filling this out again, or, you know, having gone through this process.  
106  
00:13:24.550 \--\> 00:13:31.769  
P9: I feel like maybe 10 years would even be, like, a good… I don't know, catch-all, maybe?  
107  
00:13:32.370 \--\> 00:13:35.120  
P9: Just something, yeah, just something to say, like.  
108  
00:13:35.910 \--\> 00:13:51.399  
P9: you still qualify, even if it's… I just don't want people to think that it's been too long. That's what… okay, that's what this communicates to me. Like, oh, I've been away too long, I might not qualify, somebody might close out at this… at this one.  
109  
00:13:52.450 \--\> 00:14:05.470  
Moderator That's a really important insight. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah, and I… I'm gonna return to that point later. I have a couple follow-up questions, but I want to get to… I want to get to the end of the test, and then.  
110  
00:14:05.470 \--\> 00:14:06.350  
P9: Absolutely.  
111  
00:14:10.610 \--\> 00:14:13.270  
P9: What is the highest character?  
112  
00:14:28.340 \--\> 00:14:38.359  
P9: Okay, that's helpful, because I was going to say, wait, we're… okay, there's the link to immediately apply for the upgrade, and it opens a new tab, which is nice.  
113  
00:14:39.750 \--\> 00:14:44.049  
P9: And it tells you that. Super accessible. I like that.  
114  
00:14:45.630 \--\> 00:14:48.830  
P9: Do you have a feeding disability rating?  
115  
00:14:49.380 \--\> 00:14:50.160  
P9: Yes.  
116  
00:14:56.000 \--\> 00:15:03.410  
P9: Okay, this is the review, goals, service, separation… Let me see…  
117  
00:15:03.930 \--\> 00:15:09.019  
P9: I like that\! I like that it says that it's gonna open a new tab for you.  
118  
00:15:13.170 \--\> 00:15:21.379  
Moderator Yeah, and I noticed that it didn't open correctly. That's one of the things that, isn't working correctly in the prototype, that it'll…  
119  
00:15:21.380 \--\> 00:15:25.470  
P9: On VA.gov, it will, it will… Okay.  
120  
00:15:28.540 \--\> 00:15:33.049  
P9: Can you submit? Based on your answers, we're recommending…  
121  
00:15:34.920 \--\> 00:15:42.950  
P9: Okay, you can go back and update your answers, that's nice. Remember… Independence.  
122  
00:15:45.140 \--\> 00:15:54.790  
P9: Okay, that's helpful. That… well, that makes sense then, why you asked the question in terms of, like, how far removed, in terms of, like.  
123  
00:15:54.900 \--\> 00:16:04.870  
P9: The granular movements away, because if somebody is 6 months versus a year removed, they could be eligible for different stuff based on that.  
124  
00:16:07.020 \--\> 00:16:08.950  
Moderator Yeah, so…  
125  
00:16:09.900 \--\> 00:16:12.339  
P9: Oh, here it is. Here's the recommendations.  
126  
00:16:15.120 \--\> 00:16:16.240  
P9: Sorry, go ahead.  
127  
00:16:16.540 \--\> 00:16:18.739  
Moderator No, I'll come back to that question later.  
128  
00:16:30.860 \--\> 00:16:32.930  
Moderator What are you looking at now while you're scrolling?  
129  
00:16:33.470 \--\> 00:16:37.969  
P9: Oh, these are the recommendations based on all of my answers.  
130  
00:16:38.200 \--\> 00:16:45.869  
P9: I like that you can filter them, like, seeing, oh, that's nice, when to apply before or after separation.  
131  
00:16:46.030 \--\> 00:16:50.490  
P9: Benefit type, burial careers…  
132  
00:16:50.660 \--\> 00:16:57.680  
P9: So you can even filter out your own recommendations. So far, I have 9 recommendations.  
133  
00:16:57.950 \--\> 00:17:06.149  
P9: And a lot of them are super accurate. The only one I maybe haven't heard about is…  
134  
00:17:09.109 \--\> 00:17:19.779  
P9: Oh, no, I've heard of that one. I just… that's successful on campus. Hmm. I don't know, that… that sounds familiar, but everything else, yeah, that's…  
135  
00:17:19.780 \--\> 00:17:22.910  
Moderator It's pretty accurate based on my answers, I feel like.  
136  
00:17:23.060 \--\> 00:17:33.180  
P9: I'd be able to get a good start from here. Can you print this page? Would you be able to, like, print or export this page somewhere?  
137  
00:17:36.250 \--\> 00:17:39.729  
Moderator How would you like to be able to save it?  
138  
00:17:40.400 \--\> 00:17:40.930  
P9: It sounds like.  
139  
00:17:40.930 \--\> 00:17:42.510  
Moderator You would like to be able to save it.  
140  
00:17:42.810 \--\> 00:17:56.600  
P9: Yeah, like, I… like, after I fill that out, I definitely would want to… like, I probably would screenshot, or just… I would turn this into the whole page into a PDF. I mean, I wouldn't know how to do that, but older vets, probably not.  
141  
00:17:56.670 \--\> 00:18:13.159  
P9: But yeah, I would want to save this as a way to go back and, like, work through this as a checklist, like, okay, let me check out this one, I'm gonna check out the disability compensation, okay, I did that. GI Bill, benefits, I'll check out if I'm eligible.  
142  
00:18:13.160 \--\> 00:18:18.719  
P9: And just kind of, like, work my way through this list to see if it's relevant.  
143  
00:18:18.720 \--\> 00:18:39.319  
P9: or I'm eligible more or less. And then also, I would probably give this list to my, VSO rep as well, like, just to see, like, okay, I would be like, Kevin, like, how do I get to this, or do you have any recommendations on how to navigate this? Like, you know.  
144  
00:18:39.960 \--\> 00:18:46.759  
P9: As well. So, also, like, a reference point for anybody who's helping me through any of these processes.  
145  
00:18:47.220 \--\> 00:18:54.850  
Moderator Kevin sounds great, I'm glad you're getting VSO support with benefits. It can be really helpful.  
146  
00:18:54.850 \--\> 00:18:56.090  
P9: Yeah, thank you.  
147  
00:18:57.390 \--\> 00:18:59.640  
Moderator So if you scroll back up to the top.  
148  
00:18:59.970 \--\> 00:19:05.089  
Moderator Can you tell me what you're noticing in this area underneath where it says filters?  
149  
00:19:05.450 \--\> 00:19:06.360  
P9: Oh, okay.  
150  
00:19:07.030 \--\> 00:19:16.390  
P9: Recommended for you, all results. Okay, so these are only for me.  
151  
00:19:16.580 \--\> 00:19:24.549  
P9: And all results would probably be, like, every single type of benefit you could already have, when to apply, if that makes sense.  
152  
00:19:24.690 \--\> 00:19:43.890  
P9: Benefit type… okay, the burials and memorials, that's… I think that was the thing I was trying to remember when I was thinking about, like, planning for your future, because thinking about, like, death and, like, aftercare, afterlife, or care, like, as you transition.  
153  
00:19:43.940 \--\> 00:19:49.750  
P9: to being elderly, like, that type of thing.  
154  
00:19:50.420 \--\> 00:20:06.859  
P9: So yeah, life insurance, that's another thing, your pension as well, and then more support, that's cool. So then you can apply all of these filters to even see, like, okay, well, right now, I'm really only focused on  
155  
00:20:06.860 \--\> 00:20:16.410  
P9: my career, so then I would filter it through career, apply the filter, and then it would only show me stuff that's still recommended for me.  
156  
00:20:16.760 \--\> 00:20:23.539  
P9: Based on the filter, I still have that checked, and then I have career, so it'll only show me career stuff for me.  
157  
00:20:23.940 \--\> 00:20:27.979  
P9: Then it could also show me career stuff in general, it looks like.  
158  
00:20:30.180 \--\> 00:20:37.449  
P9: Yeah, it can show me career stuff in general, which… Hmm, okay.  
159  
00:20:39.880 \--\> 00:20:42.990  
P9: Which is nice, because then you could, like.  
160  
00:20:43.710 \--\> 00:20:49.619  
P9: Like, I know for a fact, I have a veteran friend who's going through this process now.  
161  
00:20:49.830 \--\> 00:20:58.090  
P9: So, something like seeing all the results, even though I see stuff that's for me, I might want to look at something for somebody else, or…  
162  
00:20:58.200 \--\> 00:21:02.410  
Moderator I may just think it missed something and just want to go through and see.  
163  
00:21:02.510 \--\> 00:21:04.560  
P9: Filter, look through myself.  
164  
00:21:06.060 \--\> 00:21:07.780  
P9: Yeah, it's a nice feature.  
165  
00:21:08.520 \--\> 00:21:14.950  
Moderator Do you have a sense of why the cards are given to you in the order that they're given to you?  
166  
00:21:22.300 \--\> 00:21:25.529  
P9: It looks like when to apply.  
167  
00:21:25.830 \--\> 00:21:30.679  
P9: yeah, it's ordered based on when you apply.  
168  
00:21:31.570 \--\> 00:21:36.520  
P9: The last thing is after you separate from service, and the first thing is…  
169  
00:21:36.990 \--\> 00:21:43.450  
P9: up to 80… 180 days before you separate from service. So that's, yeah, before and after you separate.  
170  
00:21:43.700 \--\> 00:21:45.599  
Moderator Did you see a way to sort?  
171  
00:21:45.820 \--\> 00:21:52.929  
P9: Oh yeah, that's right here. Short, you can do by expiration date, name, and type of benefit.  
172  
00:21:58.460 \--\> 00:22:03.590  
Moderator How would you expect them to be sorted when you first come onto the page?  
173  
00:22:06.070 \--\> 00:22:11.469  
P9: Yeah, probably about that expiration date. That's perfect, because I would want to know, like.  
174  
00:22:11.610 \--\> 00:22:30.859  
P9: what's priority, like, what's urgent right now, like this DoD skill bridge program up to 100 days… 180 days before you separate from service, like, that would be coming up really quick, so that would probably be the first thing that I would want to slash expect to see.  
175  
00:22:32.570 \--\> 00:22:33.660  
P9: And then…  
176  
00:22:34.460 \--\> 00:22:48.939  
P9: Yeah, because that makes sense. Like, if we're talking about transition, we're talking about benefits, that's what really matters, is, like, if you're in versus if you're out, and if you're in that weird, in purgatory, like, in between in the military, it's like.  
177  
00:22:48.940 \--\> 00:22:56.249  
P9: really important in terms of, like, your timeline. So definitely connected to that whole process.  
178  
00:22:57.670 \--\> 00:22:58.319  
Moderator Got it.  
179  
00:23:00.300 \--\> 00:23:03.410  
Moderator What do you think about the filters?  
180  
00:23:09.850 \--\> 00:23:14.779  
P9: I think they make sense. They're very… I feel like they're very intuitive.  
181  
00:23:15.150 \--\> 00:23:20.710  
P9: And then based on everything that I gave answers to.  
182  
00:23:20.960 \--\> 00:23:39.409  
P9: I can expect to see, like, different… different stuff that I named at the beginning that I would expect to see, but this is broken down, even further from those first, like, couple categories that it asked about, like, what are your goals? I see how that's connected to that.  
183  
00:23:45.600 \--\> 00:23:46.799  
Moderator Is there anything missing?  
184  
00:23:51.220 \--\> 00:23:59.159  
P9: I'm gonna say… I would put something about children, or, like, dependents, or something like that, like…  
185  
00:23:59.560 \--\> 00:24:14.920  
P9: Because, like, your spouse and your children are a whole separate category, I feel like. Like, they… again, it said that they would fall under this because they could also receive the same benefits, but I don't know, I feel like emphasizing that  
186  
00:24:14.920 \--\> 00:24:20.020  
P9: Again, is really important, because two, also,  
187  
00:24:22.080 \--\> 00:24:41.490  
P9: I mean, I'm… I'm single, but I can only imagine, you know, if somebody is a veteran and they have, like, a spouse, the spouse could even be doing this as well for themselves or for the veteran as well. So, just an extra category to delineate and make sure that  
188  
00:24:41.940 \--\> 00:24:50.529  
P9: it's still an emphasis on that they can receive these benefits as well, in some type of way. That would be the only one I would say is missing.  
189  
00:24:50.750 \--\> 00:24:52.180  
Moderator That's a good insight.  
190  
00:24:52.180 \--\> 00:24:52.990  
P9: Yeah.  
191  
00:24:52.990 \--\> 00:25:02.150  
Moderator So, I want to go back to when you first got onto the page. I noticed that you scrolled down, you started looking at the benefits, you initially…  
192  
00:25:02.150 \--\> 00:25:13.699  
Moderator Skipped over the filter part, and I've noticed doing these has some people skipped, some people don't. I'm wondering what your thoughts were when you were… when you were going past the filters on your way to the cards.  
193  
00:25:15.070 \--\> 00:25:19.709  
P9: Oh, because I feel like I like to look at  
194  
00:25:20.410 \--\> 00:25:36.990  
P9: everything first, and see, like, okay, what are the recommendations, and then, like, kind of pick out what I want, and then the filters can help you, like, also sift through them, but I also felt like there wasn't that many results, like.  
195  
00:25:37.010 \--\> 00:25:45.860  
P9: it said how many I got. It was, like, 9 results, I think, at first, from the initial test, so I felt like that was a good amount.  
196  
00:25:45.860 \--\> 00:25:58.239  
P9: that I could personally go through where I didn't need the filters, but if it had, like, another page of results or, like, something like 20, then I would probably use the filters to, like, help me narrow it down more.  
197  
00:25:59.650 \--\> 00:26:05.550  
Moderator Got it. So, like, with the manageable amount of information, you want to see what's there before you start filtering.  
198  
00:26:05.690 \--\> 00:26:06.270  
P9: Yeah.  
199  
00:26:10.230 \--\> 00:26:30.070  
Moderator So, thinking about… about the cards, like, when you, when you were first scrolling, I know that, you were looking at when to apply, you were looking, you were looking at the… at the title that said, recommended to you. What jumped out at you first on… on these cards?  
200  
00:26:35.280 \--\> 00:26:54.150  
P9: I would say the stuff… the stuff in bold, like, that immediately, and then on top of it, like, what it was about, like, careers and employment, it was very clear, like, okay, this is the name of the program, then I'm gonna get a quick description,  
201  
00:26:56.270 \--\> 00:27:02.410  
P9: But yeah, ultimately… This was, like, kind of, like, the beginning?  
202  
00:27:02.680 \--\> 00:27:05.210  
P9: I guess, of, like, your, your search.  
203  
00:27:06.330 \--\> 00:27:09.930  
P9: Are your answers for benefits, or what's relevant to you?  
204  
00:27:13.400 \--\> 00:27:20.370  
Moderator Could you choose a benefit that you're interested in, and then click through to it, please?  
205  
00:27:22.490 \--\> 00:27:25.130  
P9: I'm gonna do…  
206  
00:27:28.350 \--\> 00:27:31.490  
P9: Let's do veteran preference for federal hiring.  
207  
00:27:33.550 \--\> 00:27:36.560  
P9: Because I'm there. Oh, okay.  
208  
00:27:45.430 \--\> 00:27:47.649  
P9: Looks like the real page.  
209  
00:27:49.740 \--\> 00:27:52.799  
P9: Okay, so it went directly to it.  
210  
00:27:56.200 \--\> 00:27:57.749  
Moderator Is that what you were expecting?  
211  
00:27:59.230 \--\> 00:28:00.960  
P9: No.  
212  
00:28:00.960 \--\> 00:28:02.460  
Moderator What were you expecting to happen?  
213  
00:28:03.110 \--\> 00:28:06.399  
P9: You may be in trouble.  
214  
00:28:09.150 \--\> 00:28:16.960  
P9: I was expecting, like, another page within… like, VA.gov?  
215  
00:28:16.960 \--\> 00:28:18.199  
Moderator That would…  
216  
00:28:18.470 \--\> 00:28:21.140  
P9: tell… like, I would expect a link  
217  
00:28:21.440 \--\> 00:28:23.679  
P9: I don't know, can I hover over this link?  
218  
00:28:24.820 \--\> 00:28:43.999  
P9: I can see what it is now, but I… before I hovered, or I didn't see the link, I would expect me to take me to another, VA.gov page, and then give more links on, like, what I could find or tell me that is gonna take me to, like, the OPM page, but I didn't…

00:28:44.000 \--\> 00:28:44.470  
Moderator Excellent.  
220  
00:28:44.470 \--\> 00:28:48.330  
P9: expect that. I didn't expect it to take me away from the website.  
221  
00:28:48.550 \--\> 00:29:00.649  
Moderator Got it. And I noticed when you were going through the questionnaire, you liked it that it told you when it was going to open something in a new tab. Is that something you expected to happen here as well?  
222  
00:29:01.330 \--\> 00:29:02.130  
P9: No.  
223  
00:29:02.130 \--\> 00:29:02.600  
Moderator Okay.  
224  
00:29:02.600 \--\> 00:29:03.260  
P9: Wait.  
225  
00:29:03.540 \--\> 00:29:04.670  
P9: Yes.  
226  
00:29:04.900 \--\> 00:29:10.520  
P9: Yeah, I did expect it to open a new tab. Like, for Learn More, yeah, for the link, yeah, a new tab.  
227  
00:29:10.950 \--\> 00:29:20.000  
Moderator Yeah, so could you scroll up a little bit, please, and scroll… let's, could you please click on GI Bill?  
228  
00:29:20.330 \--\> 00:29:21.100  
P9: Okay.  
229  
00:29:25.650 \--\> 00:29:26.640  
P9: Okay.  
230  
00:29:28.020 \--\> 00:29:33.009  
Moderator Is this what you would expect following a link for… to… for GI Bill?  
231  
00:29:33.210 \--\> 00:29:33.980  
P9: Yes.  
232  
00:29:35.820 \--\> 00:29:37.460  
P9: Absolutely.  
233  
00:29:39.160 \--\> 00:29:45.500  
P9: Yeah, because there's so many types of GI bills, like, and so many, like, programs attached to it.  
234  
00:29:45.840 \--\> 00:29:55.650  
P9: It gives, like, a general description, and then it breaks down the types of GI bills, and then where you can apply.  
235  
00:29:57.660 \--\> 00:29:59.720  
P9: Yeah, I would expect to see this.  
236  
00:30:05.200 \--\> 00:30:19.050  
Moderator Yeah, we had a design decision to make on that, whether we would take you, you know, just to learn more, where it talks about the benefit, or if we would take you to the application for the benefit, or provide both. Do you think we made the right decision?  
237  
00:30:23.600 \--\> 00:30:24.680  
P9: I would just…  
238  
00:30:27.920 \--\> 00:30:32.280  
P9: I would say… Both.  
239  
00:30:32.990 \--\> 00:30:47.269  
P9: Just because I definitely understand wanting, like, less clicks to get where you want to, because that can be frustrating sometimes. Like, if you're just clicking through so much, and you're still ending up on the same page and not…  
240  
00:30:47.430 \--\> 00:30:53.680  
P9: like, at the final people you need to talk to. However, when it, like.  
241  
00:30:53.890 \--\> 00:30:59.189  
P9: It can get so granular, sometimes it's just necessary, so I would say both.  
242  
00:31:00.080 \--\> 00:31:13.919  
P9: The GI Bill, that made sense. For the other one, I was a little shocked, but that also makes sense as well, because they don't really handle that, so I would expect to maybe go to a different page.  
243  
00:31:14.390 \--\> 00:31:15.680  
P9: But just a warning.  
244  
00:31:16.110 \--\> 00:31:19.530  
Moderator So, like, you were leaving VA.  
245  
00:31:19.530 \--\> 00:31:20.370  
P9: Yes.  
246  
00:31:20.690 \--\> 00:31:22.399  
Moderator Got it. Okay.  
247  
00:31:22.550 \--\> 00:31:25.230  
Moderator Could you go back?  
248  
00:31:26.510 \--\> 00:31:28.289  
Moderator to the page.  
249  
00:31:32.340 \--\> 00:31:42.040  
Moderator When you were navigating back to this page from OPM, from GI Bill, did you have any hesitation, like, you were gonna lose your… lose your answers?  
250  
00:31:44.950 \--\> 00:31:45.520  
Moderator Or did you.  
251  
00:31:45.520 \--\> 00:31:45.870  
P9: Yeah.  
252  
00:31:45.870 \--\> 00:31:47.570  
Moderator It's still gonna be here for you.  
253  
00:31:47.570 \--\> 00:31:49.340  
P9: I thought they would still be here.  
254  
00:31:50.430 \--\> 00:31:55.869  
Moderator That's good to know. Is there… is there anything else you want to share about… about this tool?  
255  
00:31:58.880 \--\> 00:32:17.810  
P9: Oh, I think it's really intuitive, I think it's really helpful. I think it will definitely cut down on the questions in terms of, like, what am I eligible for? But also, like, expanding people's awareness about other programs and stuff like that. I think for the…  
256  
00:32:18.220 \--\> 00:32:24.720  
P9: older generation, this'll especially be helpful. It's… it's, you know, in a very much…  
257  
00:32:25.430 \--\> 00:32:42.289  
P9: I feel like just a way that they can understand, and it's very digestible, but even for, like, younger veterans, like for myself, I feel like it just helps us see ourselves more in the veteran space. Like, we're also eligible for that stuff, like…  
258  
00:32:42.670 \--\> 00:32:56.999  
P9: I think that's the biggest thing, is, like, trying to capture us and let us know that, hey, you are eligible, because I think sometimes people get so bogged down in the process of this whole thing, like, it just takes a lot of time, a lot of waiting, that…  
259  
00:32:57.000 \--\> 00:33:11.779  
P9: even stuff like this will deter people from seeking out more information, and so I think this is very cut and dry, like, what do you want to address here today, and then asking the questions to follow up.  
260  
00:33:11.780 \--\> 00:33:18.840  
P9: In terms of, like, what you're eligible for, and then giving you the opportunity to expand and directly connect  
261  
00:33:19.160 \--\> 00:33:21.809  
P9: To those services is very useful.  
262  
00:33:23.130 \--\> 00:33:29.219  
Moderator 1 to 5, 1 being the worst, 5 being the best, how would you rate this tool?  
263  
00:33:30.160 \--\> 00:33:32.519  
P9: I would say 4.3.  
264  
00:33:33.300 \--\> 00:33:38.600  
Moderator That… could… could you say more about why you gave it their rating?  
265  
00:33:39.860 \--\> 00:33:50.130  
P9: It's like… is so close to being perfect, like, just in terms of… I would say, accessibility, just  
266  
00:33:52.730 \--\> 00:34:02.140  
P9: I'll say this, I don't like this term, but it just kind of makes sense for every type of situation, but making it, like, soldier-proof.  
267  
00:34:02.290 \--\> 00:34:05.160  
Moderator Making it… making it dummy-proof.  
268  
00:34:05.160 \--\> 00:34:15.579  
P9: Like, that's why I kept pointing out the subtitles. I liked all of those. I liked some of the redundancy that was, like, built in, like, repeating or saying, like, what you mean, because  
269  
00:34:15.580 \--\> 00:34:35.319  
P9: you wouldn't believe the amount of, like, jargon and just, like, words. Like, people know what a GI Bill is generally, like, it pays for education, but what's the difference between a post and a 9-11? Like, nobody really knows that, like, unless you're in it, and so, like, those reinforcements, even, like, the…  
270  
00:34:35.409 \--\> 00:34:53.980  
P9: helping people kind of know what to expect, because some stuff is built in. Like, I say, as a millennial, like, veteran, like, I'm very computer savvy. I know when I click a link, I can either expect a new tab to open, or the page to completely change.  
271  
00:34:53.980 \--\> 00:34:59.569  
P9: But younger or older generations may not, so even having that  
272  
00:34:59.570 \--\> 00:35:19.520  
P9: this will open a new tab. It's just still really even helpful. But also for disabled veterans as well. People who may need screen readers, or, like, they have, like, low visual and stuff like that, or people who like to listen to other screen being read, because they have low vision.  
273  
00:35:19.970 \--\> 00:35:29.129  
P9: Stuff like that can be just really helpful, in navigating a page and making sense of, what they're gonna see next.  
274  
00:35:30.830 \--\> 00:35:46.940  
Moderator I want to circle back to something you said when you were doing the questionnaire about, you know, maybe people who are homeless wouldn't feel included, or maybe someone who's in crisis wouldn't feel like this is for them. Now that you've done the whole toll,  
275  
00:35:46.960 \--\> 00:35:53.110  
Moderator Do you think that this is welcoming or useful for someone who might be in crisis?  
276  
00:35:59.540 \--\> 00:36:00.580  
P9: No.  
277  
00:36:02.390 \--\> 00:36:06.849  
Moderator What could we do better to… to make it work for those people?  
278  
00:36:09.120 \--\> 00:36:18.620  
P9: Is I would say… Cause, like, I might… okay, for example.  
279  
00:36:20.920 \--\> 00:36:33.469  
P9: Is this… is this targeting… I guess my question is, is this targeting vets who have never had services before, or, like, both? People who have and need to come back?  
280  
00:36:33.580 \--\> 00:36:34.750  
P9: Or…  
281  
00:36:36.170 \--\> 00:36:37.510  
Moderator It is…  
282  
00:36:38.040 \--\> 00:36:47.369  
Moderator The targeted user is somebody who is transitioning and early in the process of getting benefits, you know, in their first few years as a veteran.  
283  
00:36:47.420 \--\> 00:37:06.949  
Moderator But we want it to work for anyone who needs it. We want it to work, for example, for, for older people who've been out 20 years and who've never thought about their benefits, and are leaving money on the table, or, you know, just for anybody. We want it to work for anybody, even though it's…  
284  
00:37:06.990 \--\> 00:37:10.020  
Moderator Targeted at transitioning service members.  
285  
00:37:10.480 \--\> 00:37:33.440  
P9: Yeah, then I would say that one question is the only thing that I would change then, because everything else does what it needs to do in terms of targeting, like, the people who are transitioning, and, like, those first-time people, like, this is really, really great for them. For the people returning, or, like, those people who get disconnected for a little while from their community or their resources.  
286  
00:37:33.440 \--\> 00:37:47.009  
P9: I would just say changing that question, can frame how you access your benefits. Like, it's a continual thing, and not like a… like, some things are an open window, and then some things are not. I think that's…  
287  
00:37:47.010 \--\> 00:37:51.550  
P9: What is also important, too, because when the… a lot of these are, like.  
288  
00:37:51.870 \--\> 00:38:08.400  
P9: Yeah, that's what it was for me. There's a little bit of a disconnect between that question and the results that are answered here, because if I'm expecting this to only be about people who are transitioning,  
289  
00:38:08.400 \--\> 00:38:20.220  
P9: It says before and after separation, but a lot of these could be, like, really a lot, a lot after separation. So, like, what does that mean? And I think,  
290  
00:38:20.250 \--\> 00:38:41.600  
P9: that will capture… that question change will capture that… those people, and help them see themselves still in these results. Because a veteran's preference in federal hiring, like, that doesn't end, ever, just because, you know, 180 days or anything. So, that one would be super relevant to somebody who  
291  
00:38:41.930 \--\> 00:38:44.379  
P9: Is reconnecting.  
292  
00:38:45.280 \--\> 00:38:45.930  
P9: Yeah.  
293  
00:38:46.780 \--\> 00:38:49.340  
Moderator Yeah, thanks for that insight.  
294  
00:38:49.670 \--\> 00:38:52.819  
Moderator But just a couple more questions.  
295  
00:38:52.820 \--\> 00:38:53.370  
P9: Yeah.  
296  
00:38:53.950 \--\> 00:39:04.260  
Moderator For you, thinking about your life today, you know, you've, you've, been… you've transitioned to civilian life years ago at this point, and,  
297  
00:39:04.640 \--\> 00:39:11.910  
Moderator thinking about… you know, the benefits you might be interested in now. Is this tool helpful for you?  
298  
00:39:12.290 \--\> 00:39:13.070  
P9: Yes.  
299  
00:39:13.590 \--\> 00:39:15.680  
P9: Yeah, even today, still.  
300  
00:39:15.950 \--\> 00:39:19.579  
Moderator Like, what is the foreign medical program? I never heard of that.  
301  
00:39:20.520 \--\> 00:39:32.600  
Moderator So, you're interested in the benefits you haven't heard of, or, and it also, it sounds like you'd want to return to this and look at it over time. What else about it would be useful to you?  
302  
00:39:36.560 \--\> 00:39:43.160  
P9: I think the shareability, being able to… like, I like these little boxes, because it's, like.  
303  
00:39:43.240 \--\> 00:39:48.740  
P9: if I screenshot this and send this to my friend really quick, like, hey friend, you should check this out.  
304  
00:39:48.740 \--\> 00:40:04.360  
P9: I can… I can also send the link as well. Maybe that's what I would want to see, like, more… a little bit more shareability, because if you know somebody else who needs this, just being able to quick, do a quick  
305  
00:40:04.360 \--\> 00:40:11.730  
P9: Hey, you know, whatever. Even, weirdly enough, even social media, because you wouldn't be surprised how many people are.  
306  
00:40:11.730 \--\> 00:40:19.200  
Moderator just connected by Facebook or something, so if I could Facebook message this to my friend, or DM this through Twitter.  
307  
00:40:19.330 \--\> 00:40:31.819  
P9: X, whatever they call it now, or Instagram, or something like that, like, making it super shareable will also let other people know about this tool, because, they would…  
308  
00:40:31.860 \--\> 00:40:51.019  
P9: either they could have access to, like, the actual link, or they would also have to take this quiz to get through that, you know? Yeah. And I… and I could say, hey, friend, I did this in, like, 3 minutes, take this quiz real quick, so you can find out what you're eligible for. It's on the VA website, it's secure.  
309  
00:40:51.020 \--\> 00:41:03.289  
P9: And, like, they'll give you direct links to where you can go next. Because I think that's another thing, too, is, like, trustworthiness. Like, is this coming from the VA, or are you just saying this?  
310  
00:41:05.250 \--\> 00:41:05.680  
P9: That's…  
311  
00:41:05.680 \--\> 00:41:20.500  
Moderator Really, that's really good to know, and, definitely gonna take… take that insight into account. Because you said that this is useful for you now, I put a link to our live tool in the… in the chat, so,  
312  
00:41:20.500 \--\> 00:41:20.990  
P9: Oh, thanks.  
313  
00:41:20.990 \--\> 00:41:35.919  
Moderator you can return to it. This is… this is the real tool that's live now. It's gonna look a little bit different, because we… because it's an older version, it's not the prototype you saw today, but a lot of the core functions are the same, and a lot of the core information is the same.  
314  
00:41:36.240 \--\> 00:41:39.430  
Moderator So, that's…  
315  
00:41:39.720 \--\> 00:41:45.940  
Moderator That's the end of our test, unless there's anything else you'd like to share with me.  
316  
00:41:49.280 \--\> 00:41:55.070  
P9: I think that's it. I'm literally sending it to my friend now.  
317  
00:41:55.280 \--\> 00:42:10.630  
Moderator Yay\! Yeah, so that… that makes my… that made my day, because, you know, that's why we're here, to make things that are useful for veterans, so thanks for… thank you for sharing that, that you… that you're sharing it.  
318  
00:42:11.050 \--\> 00:42:11.710  
Moderator And…  
319  
00:42:11.710 \--\> 00:42:25.380  
P9: I'm also a librarian, so I'm gonna share it with all my librarian friends and people in the library who are looking for these types of resources, so it's really helpful. Yeah, it's gonna be a really great tool.  
320  
00:42:27.420 \--\> 00:42:35.110  
Moderator That's so exciting. And, yeah, you're gonna… speaking of that,  
321  
00:42:35.150 \--\> 00:42:48.930  
Moderator you're going to be getting a thank you card from Paragian, that has information on how you can share, you know, the opportunity to test with other veterans, and…  
322  
00:42:52.370 \--\> 00:43:08.259  
Moderator I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts today. It's been really great hearing from you, and your feedback is so helpful as we continue to build this tool out, and yeah, it means so much that it's useful to you, and that you're sharing it, so…  
323  
00:43:08.540 \--\> 00:43:09.290  
Moderator death.  
324  
00:43:09.720 \--\> 00:43:13.239  
P9: Thank you, you all have a great day. Happy Wednesday.  
325  
00:43:13.240 \--\> 00:43:14.139  
Moderator You too.  
326  
00:43:14.420 \--\> 00:43:15.050  
Moderator Bye\!  
327  
00:43:15.050 \--\> 00:43:15.880  
P9: Bye.
