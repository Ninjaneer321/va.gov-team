00:05:20.930 \--\> 00:05:21.740  
P16: Okay.  
55  
00:05:22.010 \--\> 00:05:28.760

56  
00:05:28.960 \--\> 00:05:31.999  
Moderator: Great. If you could please share your screen.  
57  
00:05:33.470 \--\> 00:05:35.070  
P16: How do I do that?  
58  
00:05:35.070 \--\> 00:05:39.959  
Moderator: So if you look… are you in the… in Zoom in the browser, or are you using the app?  
59  
00:05:40.770 \--\> 00:05:44.839  
P16: I'm… I just clicked from the email, I don't know.  
60  
00:05:45.350 \--\> 00:06:02.030  
Moderator: So if you look at the bottom of… like, underneath where you're… where the video call is, there's a row of icons at the bottom of the screen on Zoom. It's things like, you'll see, like, little people that say participants, and then right next to that.  
61  
00:06:02.220 \--\> 00:06:08.900  
Moderator: There's chat, react, there's a heart, and then to the right of that, there is the share button, it has an arrow on it.  
62  
00:06:17.300 \--\> 00:06:18.240  
P16: Okay.  
63  
00:06:25.950 \--\> 00:06:27.200  
P16: It is…  
64  
00:06:32.080 \--\> 00:06:35.229  
Moderator: Are you on a screen where it's asking you sharing options?  
65  
00:06:36.470 \--\> 00:06:37.365  
P16: Yeah…  
66  
00:06:38.460 \--\> 00:06:49.639  
Moderator: So, usually, the easiest way to do it is to just share the browser, like, to just share Safari, but if you do need to share the desktop, you can do that too.  
67  
00:06:55.890 \--\> 00:07:00.620  
P16: It's asking me to allow, and I'm trying to…  
68  
00:07:03.610 \--\> 00:07:07.689  
Moderator: Got you. So you… is it giving you a link for settings?  
69  
00:07:08.280 \--\> 00:07:10.889  
Moderator: I'm trying to put in the password right now, I'm sorry.  
70  
00:07:10.890 \--\> 00:07:11.320  
P16: Huh.  
71  
00:07:11.320 \--\> 00:07:12.010  
Moderator: Gotcha.  
72  
00:07:40.770 \--\> 00:07:46.050  
P16: I… Sorry, I forgot the password. Oh my god.  
73  
00:07:50.310 \--\> 00:07:51.869  
P16: I'm trying to…  
74  
00:07:52.550 \--\> 00:08:05.480  
Moderator: This is totally fine. Take your time. I can stay on until 12, or even after, if you need some time to figure this out, if you need to leave and come back, if you want to try it again on your phone.  
75  
00:08:06.470 \--\> 00:08:07.720  
Moderator: No stress.  
76  
00:09:13.510 \--\> 00:09:14.780  
P16: Was it able to do it?  
77  
00:09:14.780 \--\> 00:09:15.420

Moderator: Okay.  
84  
00:09:34.410 \--\> 00:09:53.729  
Moderator: Okay, so what I'd like you to do for, this part of the session is… I would like you to explore… discover your benefits, like you would if you were doing it on your own.

89  
00:10:07.770 \--\> 00:10:09.130

90  
00:10:29.860 \--\> 00:10:31.599

96  
00:12:01.620 \--\> 00:12:05.760

P16: Can I make notes?  
108

P16: your… what you're seeing here, how it might work for people who are just transitioning, or for people who are, you know, struggling to get benefits, who are at the beginning of the process. Right. Yeah, please share that, too, along with.  
118  
00:14:32.120 \--\> 00:14:34.989  
Moderator: You know, what you're noticing that you might like to use.  
119  
00:14:35.470 \--\> 00:14:45.589  
P16: Yeah, so that's… I noticed that a lot of veterans that come into Veterans Treatment Court, a lot of them  
120  
00:14:45.630 \--\> 00:15:00.810  
P16: need help with housing. They've been in addiction for a really long time, they've ignored their benefits, and a lot of them… I have a mentee right now that's using a housing assistance program, so,  
121  
00:15:00.810 \--\> 00:15:10.760  
P16: That's something… this is something that could be beneficial to other… other veterans, for sure, that are in a transition phase.  
122  
00:15:11.320 \--\> 00:15:19.919  
P16: The same thing with GI Bill benefits, as far as, like, veterans that have made… maybe have been in addiction, and…  
123  
00:15:20.260 \--\> 00:15:30.060  
P16: haven't been interested in going to school, but now they're practicing abstinence, and they want to use their GI Bill benefits.  
124  
00:15:30.520 \--\> 00:15:35.990  
P16: Yeah, this is a really, really good page with a lot of good, information.  
125  
00:15:37.110 \--\> 00:15:45.279  
P16: State benefits, because each state is different. Each state may offer different things, there's different programs out there.  
126  
00:15:50.800 \--\> 00:15:59.339  
P16: mental health, A lot of MST, I see a lot of PTSD, which I have myself.  
127  
00:16:05.710 \--\> 00:16:06.950  
P16: Burial.  
128  
00:16:14.410 \--\> 00:16:27.539  
P16: home loans, I have a friend right now, he just got 100%. He didn't have VA benefits for over 20 years, and so all this is really new to him, and so…  
129  
00:16:28.150 \--\> 00:16:36.559  
P16: And I helped him figure it out, but… through Navy Federal, but if he didn't know, I could always refer him to… to this.  
130  
00:16:43.000 \--\> 00:16:44.780  
P16: V-R-N-E…  
131  
00:17:02.900 \--\> 00:17:05.190  
P16: College life, that's really good.  
132  
00:17:06.550 \--\> 00:17:11.849  
P16: I did a work-study program where… in college, where I…  
133  
00:17:12.020 \--\> 00:17:17.999  
P16: Would, sign veterans up for classes and certify their benefits.  
134  
00:17:19.400 \--\> 00:17:20.509  
P16: It's really good.  
135  
00:17:32.370 \--\> 00:17:36.059  
Moderator: So, reading through these, I have a couple questions. One…  
136  
00:17:36.620 \--\> 00:17:46.769  
Moderator: How are you… what are you reading first? What are you noticing on each of these benefits? And, like…  
137  
00:17:47.650 \--\> 00:17:50.400  
Moderator: Boop.  
138  
00:17:50.520 \--\> 00:17:56.370  
Moderator: which… which part of the benefit is jumping out at you? How are you deciding what to read?  
139  
00:17:59.630 \--\> 00:18:16.020  
P16: So dis… for me personally… well, because I'm a mentor, this… I can utilize this information for myself and others, a lot of others. So the Disability Housing Grant, that stands out to me, GEI Bill Benefits, State Veterans Benefits.  
140  
00:18:16.670 \--\> 00:18:23.170  
P16: And then, last one really jumped out at me, the foreign medical program.  
141  
00:18:23.990 \--\> 00:18:33.809  
P16: I'm not interested in living overseas, but I do know other veterans that are, and even for myself at one point,  
142  
00:18:34.360 \--\> 00:18:39.309  
P16: I was like, I wonder if I would still get my VA disability if I was overseas.  
143  
00:18:39.330 \--\> 00:18:54.540  
P16: I said that to my mother, and she was like, well, you… you know, and so I ended up calling the VA and asking, and they said, yes, you would, but I did not know about the medical, so my mom was like, you probably wouldn't get medical, so that is really…  
144  
00:18:55.420 \--\> 00:18:59.260  
P16: really good. I really, like… That's really good.  
145  
00:19:01.780 \--\> 00:19:05.100  
P16: That could be a very… helpful page.  
146  
00:19:06.140 \--\> 00:19:09.340  
P16: Alright, so I'm gonna go to page 2\.  
147  
00:19:10.980 \--\> 00:19:12.980  
P16: small businesses.  
148  
00:19:15.010 \--\> 00:19:28.499  
P16: which I personally wouldn't use, but I do like to utilize veteran-owned businesses. Like, for my HVAC, I use a veteran-owned business.  
149  
00:19:31.200 \--\> 00:19:33.460  
P16: VA Healthcare…  
150  
00:19:37.600 \--\> 00:19:40.690  
P16: Okay, life insurance? Yeah.  
151  
00:19:42.360 \--\> 00:19:43.870  
P16: That stands out.  
152  
00:19:49.320 \--\> 00:19:53.389  
P16: Not so much the pension for me in particular.  
153  
00:19:57.570 \--\> 00:19:59.960  
P16: Not the federal hiring.  
154  
00:20:00.440 \--\> 00:20:04.400  
P16: Okay, so on this page, I…  
155  
00:20:06.260 \--\> 00:20:10.060  
P16: maybe the VA healthcare is something that I would utilize.  
156  
00:20:10.740 \--\> 00:20:24.190  
P16: But if I have friends or other veterans that I know, I could always say, hey, you know, you can check out the benefits for that on VA.gov. They have something for that.  
157  
00:20:25.000 \--\> 00:20:32.110  
P16: So, mainly the things that I would be interested in checking out would be things on the first page.  
158  
00:20:33.480 \--\> 00:20:40.739  
P16: So, when you are looking at one of these individual benefits, are you seeing all the information you would expect to see?  
159  
00:20:45.950 \--\> 00:20:48.730  
P16: when I'm… if I, like, so…  
160  
00:20:48.880 \--\> 00:21:00.550  
Moderator: Yeah, like, on one of these cards. Like, say, for example, do you have… do you have questions about whether something is for you or not that aren't… are not answered by the card?  
161  
00:21:02.310 \--\> 00:21:07.460  
P16: No, it has a small description or summary,  
162  
00:21:09.090 \--\> 00:21:22.139  
P16: And then, for me, I would, you know, read the description, okay, oh, I'm interested in GI Bill benefits, and then for the details of what, you know, I would click the Learn More.  
163  
00:21:22.820 \--\> 00:21:23.590  
Moderator: Gotcha.  
164  
00:21:26.890 \--\> 00:21:29.369  
Moderator: How do you think these results are sorted?  
165  
00:21:29.990 \--\> 00:21:35.160  
Moderator: Like, you know, why do you think you're seeing these ones at the top of the page?  
166  
00:21:36.790 \--\> 00:21:44.100  
P16: Because of… based on what I selected on the… Questionnaire.  
167  
00:21:44.100 \--\> 00:21:44.960  
Moderator: Gotcha.  
168  
00:21:45.590 \--\> 00:21:49.320  
Moderator: Do you see a way to change How they're displayed.  
169  
00:21:50.900 \--\> 00:21:56.449  
P16: over here, under Benefit Type.  
170  
00:21:57.210 \--\> 00:22:00.170  
P16: Or even when to apply.  
171  
00:22:00.520 \--\> 00:22:10.610  
P16: Before separation, after separation, benefit type, so if I'm wanting to know more about a specific one, I click on it, select it, and apply the filter.  
172  
00:22:11.180 \--\> 00:22:16.739  
Moderator: Gotcha. I'd like you to, play with  
173  
00:22:17.120 \--\> 00:22:20.290  
Moderator: The, with the filters on the side.  
174  
00:22:20.290 \--\> 00:22:21.000  
P16: Sure.  
175  
00:22:39.840 \--\> 00:22:40.800  
P16: Okay.  
176  
00:23:49.210 \--\> 00:24:03.370  
Moderator: Alright, so you're… you're back on this page, and I noticed you clicked through to some things. Were you… were you confident that this page was still going to be here when you… when you clicked back, when you hit the back button?  
177  
00:24:04.130 \--\> 00:24:04.860  
P16: Yes.  
178  
00:24:07.930 \--\> 00:24:21.380  
Moderator: So, a couple more questions about, choosing which benefits you're gonna see or not going to see. Because you're… because you're mentoring, because you're not just looking at benefits for you.  
179  
00:24:21.770 \--\> 00:24:29.049  
Moderator: Are you seeing a way on this page to, to choose ones that aren't just for you?  
180  
00:24:29.730 \--\> 00:24:31.489  
P16: That are… are just for me.  
181  
00:24:31.490 \--\> 00:24:36.060  
Moderator: That aren't just for you, that might… that might benefit other people.  
182  
00:24:36.060 \--\> 00:24:37.070  
P16: Oh, yeah.  
183  
00:24:37.820 \--\> 00:24:57.210  
P16: almost all of them, the disability compensation, disability housing grant, GI Bill, the reason I clicked on Get Benefits Now is because I have another friend, a female, who just got her benefits, never had them before, and.  
184  
00:24:57.210 \--\> 00:24:57.699  
Moderator: Excuse me?  
185  
00:24:57.700 \--\> 00:25:01.920  
P16: To be honest with you, I don't even think she's gone into the VA and set up her…  
186  
00:25:02.150 \--\> 00:25:06.050  
P16: healthcare provider and stuff. So that's why I clicked on it. For her, I could  
187  
00:25:06.500 \--\> 00:25:11.359  
P16: Recommend her to that, like, that's useful right now, today.  
188  
00:25:11.480 \--\> 00:25:20.209  
P16: help, you know? State benefits, mental health, that's huge.  
189  
00:25:20.390 \--\> 00:25:28.960  
P16: cemetery… yeah… \- yeah.  
190  
00:25:29.360 \--\> 00:25:37.489  
Moderator: Yeah, so when you see recommended for you at the top of the card, do you think you're seeing all the benefits that are available?  
191  
00:25:52.940 \--\> 00:25:55.200  
P16: I would think so,  
192  
00:25:55.860 \--\> 00:26:00.709  
P16: And what makes me say that is there's this other button that says More Support.  
193  
00:26:02.420 \--\> 00:26:06.740  
P16: So if it's not listed, then I can always, like, click it, and…  
194  
00:26:07.430 \--\> 00:26:13.660  
P16: see what… See what it says. If it's something more specialized that's not popping up.  
195  
00:26:20.980 \--\> 00:26:22.669  
P16: Did you want me to click it?  
196  
00:26:23.340 \--\> 00:26:25.640  
Moderator: You… you can.  
197  
00:26:29.130 \--\> 00:26:29.990  
P16: Okay.  
198  
00:26:31.160 \--\> 00:26:32.410  
Moderator: So…  
199  
00:26:32.600 \--\> 00:26:38.439

00:26:40.630 \--\> 00:26:41.600  
P16: Okay.  
201  
00:26:49.420 \--\> 00:26:50.350  
P16: Oops.  
202  
00:26:58.020 \--\> 00:27:13.179  
Moderator: Alright, so we've got a bug here that, we've been experiencing in testing. So, unfortunately, you're gonna have to go to goals, click at least one goal, and then go to Character of Discharge, and…  
203  
00:27:13.370 \--\> 00:27:14.310  
Moderator: Click that.  
204  
00:27:28.750 \--\> 00:27:30.420  
P16: Just click random ones.  
205  
00:27:58.110 \--\> 00:27:59.130  
Moderator: Oh, wow.  
206  
00:27:59.410 \--\> 00:28:02.700  
Moderator: Okay, so if you could please click on Goal.  
207  
00:28:04.690 \--\> 00:28:11.940  
Moderator: Like, you see… if you, if you scroll down, you see where it's, pink.  
208  
00:28:23.420 \--\> 00:28:26.460  
Moderator: I have not seen this error before.  
209  
00:28:27.540 \--\> 00:28:34.969  
Moderator: If you could please click on Edit, like, the button to the right, and, then click Update Page.  
210

212  
00:28:52.530 \--\> 00:28:59.990  
Moderator: So, a couple more things I'd like you to play with on this page. You see at the top of the filters where it says show results?  
213  
00:29:00.350 \--\> 00:29:09.709  
Moderator: And you see the blue checkbox that's checked. Do you have a theory about what that would do?  
214  
00:29:10.010 \--\> 00:29:12.000  
Moderator: If you… if you uncheck that.  
215  
00:29:12.970 \--\> 00:29:31.159  
P16: So, yeah, I have… like, my thoughts would be if I on… like, right now, it's specific to what I selected in the initial questionnaire. When I unclick it, it's gonna show me all of the information, like, if I'm still active duty, it's gonna show…  
216  
00:29:31.730 \--\> 00:29:33.909  
P16: Informae- it's gonna show everything.  
217  
00:29:43.920 \--\> 00:29:48.610  
P16: See, like, the transition assistants, and .  
218  
00:29:49.700 \--\> 00:29:51.570  
P16: Like, skill building, and…  
219  
00:29:52.020 \--\> 00:30:01.690  
P16: Dance, you know, just different… Like, things that wouldn't really apply… It's just everything. It's not…  
220  
00:30:01.690 \--\> 00:30:02.160  
Moderator: everything.  
221  
00:30:02.160 \--\> 00:30:03.969  
P16: Specific to me.  
222  
00:30:03.970 \--\> 00:30:06.869  
Moderator: Gotcha. Did you see that before I pointed it out to you?  
223  
00:30:07.480 \--\> 00:30:08.420  
P16: I did.  
224  
00:30:08.420 \--\> 00:30:12.820  
Moderator: Okay, did it do what you expected it to do?  
225  
00:30:14.310 \--\> 00:30:14.950  
Moderator: Okay.  
226  
00:30:16.920 \--\> 00:30:25.169  
Moderator: So, another thing is, I know, Blake… Sorting is,  
227  
00:30:26.180 \--\> 00:30:34.139  
Moderator: sorting is something else, that you're able to do, and when I asked you earlier if… how you think that  
228  
00:30:34.260 \--\> 00:30:44.040  
Moderator: the results are, you know, which one's on top, which one's on the bottom, that it was by, your answers to the questions.  
229  
00:30:44.180 \--\> 00:30:49.999  
Moderator: If you look underneath where it says your results, and then it says sort expiration date.  
230  
00:30:50.110 \--\> 00:30:53.879  
Moderator: What do you think that that, button does?  
231  
00:31:00.210 \--\> 00:31:04.360  
P16: So expiration date would maybe be…  
232  
00:31:06.910 \--\> 00:31:11.250  
P16: Well, I think it's just exactly how it states, like, Wha…  
233  
00:31:12.620 \--\> 00:31:17.799  
Moderator: the things that you would have to do soonest for what you're seeking.  
234  
00:31:17.800 \--\> 00:31:24.410  
P16: Where you can, you know, sort out the information alphabetically.  
235  
00:31:24.950 \--\> 00:31:28.170  
P16: Or… It'll group it by type.  
236  
00:31:30.740 \--\> 00:31:32.240  
P16: So, for me…  
237  
00:31:37.020 \--\> 00:31:39.720  
P16: I really… for me personally, I wouldn't…  
238  
00:31:41.470 \--\> 00:31:45.990  
P16: I would leave it as is, and just find what I needed on my own.  
239  
00:31:46.400 \--\> 00:31:54.989  
P16: But it's a nice feature if you want to do, like, A to Z, if you're looking… if someone's more of, like, apply, apply, okay.  
240  
00:31:55.270 \--\> 00:31:55.950  
Moderator: support.  
241  
00:31:55.950 \--\> 00:32:04.530  
P16: disability, or DOD, okay, E, education, that's… I'm not… yeah, I don't…  
242  
00:32:06.210 \--\> 00:32:13.499  
Moderator: Like, somebody who… so you think it would be more for somebody who wanted to be really thorough, check everything, investigate everything, like, go down the list?  
243  
00:32:14.400 \--\> 00:32:17.209  
P16: Yeah, yeah, for sure,  
244  
00:32:19.040 \--\> 00:32:24.879  
P16: for me, when I use these kinds of things, I'm pretty specific on what I'm looking for. I mean, yeah.  
245  
00:32:24.880 \--\> 00:32:25.560  
Moderator: I mean?  
246  
00:32:25.560 \--\> 00:32:28.989  
P16: It could help you find it quicker, but… I'm…  
247  
00:32:29.920 \--\> 00:32:36.070  
P16: I would think I… I think I'm pretty good at navigating, I'm pretty good with online stuff, so…  
248  
00:32:37.080 \--\> 00:32:46.360  
Moderator: earlier you said that, plan for my and my family's future, you expected to see benefits from your daughter, or for your daughter.  
249  
00:32:47.060 \--\> 00:32:53.539  
Moderator: what, and I know that there's not anything that is directly for dependents that's listed.  
250  
00:32:53.870 \--\> 00:32:57.090  
Moderator: What did you think you were going to see?  
251  
00:32:58.050 \--\> 00:33:00.569  
P16: Maybe stuff about CHAMP VA?  
252  
00:33:01.360 \--\> 00:33:12.130  
P16: Maybe about, well, I did see the GI Bill transferring benefits.  
253  
00:33:13.730 \--\> 00:33:20.920  
P16: But I mainly expected to see stuff about CHAMP VA, healthcare,  
254  
00:33:23.000 \--\> 00:33:35.210  
P16: maybe the caregiver program, which might have been listed, but if I'm in need of assistance when I… if I ever need assistance, there's a program within the VA that will  
255  
00:33:35.610 \--\> 00:33:41.740  
P16: Give family financial assistance to help me, so maybe information about that.  
256  
00:33:42.520 \--\> 00:33:57.730  
Moderator: Yeah, this is really helpful feedback, because I know that you know a lot about benefits, and it sounds like there's some things you were expecting to see that aren't here, and also some things that you were… that might have been new to you. So, yeah, that's really great insights.  
257  
00:33:57.970 \--\> 00:34:06.800  
Moderator: is there anything else you want to give feedback on on this page? Anything, that…  
258  
00:34:07.040 \--\> 00:34:10.939  
Moderator: You know, about how it feels, how it's laid out.  
259  
00:34:19.459 \--\> 00:34:30.889  
P16: I like how it's laid out, I like how you can sort your results. I like the fact that you can do before separation or after.  
260  
00:34:32.639 \--\> 00:34:37.819  
P16: I really like that button. I would keep that checked for me personally.  
261  
00:34:38.409 \--\> 00:34:47.099  
P16: Because I don't want to see extra information… for me personally, I don't want to see extra information that's not tailored to me, because then it's overwhelming.  
262  
00:34:47.530 \--\> 00:34:48.389  
P16: M…  
263  
00:34:49.510 \--\> 00:34:57.799  
P16: And then if you want to get more specific, you can select exactly what it is that you are,  
264  
00:34:57.940 \--\> 00:34:59.830  
P16: Are looking for…  
265  
00:35:02.490 \--\> 00:35:07.360  
Moderator: Alright, so I have a… I have a couple follow-up questions.  
266  
00:35:07.550 \--\> 00:35:08.160  
P16: Sure.  
267  
00:35:12.550 \--\> 00:35:23.030  
Moderator: So, you've already talked a little bit about how this is helpful for you, this is helpful for, for people who you are helping as a mentor.  
268  
00:35:23.420 \--\> 00:35:29.189  
Moderator: Is there anything else you want to share about that, now that you've used it?  
269  
00:35:33.740 \--\> 00:35:43.180  
P16: No, other than I think it's a really, really good and informative tool for veterans, and…  
270  
00:35:44.760 \--\> 00:35:51.009  
P16: I… I will definitely be referring veterans, I know, to this Discover Your Benefits page.  
271  
00:35:51.280 \--\> 00:35:59.469  
P16: I didn't know about it before, maybe because I wasn't looking for it specifically?  
272  
00:36:01.290 \--\> 00:36:06.730  
P16: And when I do look for things, I… I typically use the search.  
273  
00:36:07.760 \--\> 00:36:14.040  
P16: Or I Google it specifically, and it'll pop up and bring me to the page, but…  
274  
00:36:14.370 \--\> 00:36:22.579  
P16: Yeah, I think this is really, really great, and I definitely will be using it myself and referring other veterans to it.  
275  
00:36:23.460 \--\> 00:36:25.759  
Moderator: What would you give it on a scale of 1 to 5?  
276  
00:36:29.580 \--\> 00:36:31.229  
P16: I'd give it a 5\.  
277  
00:36:32.930 \--\> 00:36:34.080  
Moderator: Thank you.  
278  
00:36:35.270 \--\> 00:36:47.940  
Moderator: That's… that's really nice. Thinking about somebody who might be transitioning from active duty, how would you change it to make it more useful for them?  
279  
00:36:50.270 \--\> 00:37:03.140  
P16: Okay, so I would click before separation… And… apply the filter, so…  
280  
00:37:03.640 \--\> 00:37:06.900  
P16: When it was asking the goals.  
281  
00:37:07.010 \--\> 00:37:19.389  
P16: Of course, my goals at that point would be different than they are now, so I would select goals, you know, maybe housing, how to file a claim.  
282  
00:37:19.620 \--\> 00:37:26.930  
P16: I would want information about that. I would want… I would click information about my GI bill, how to get started on that.  
283  
00:37:28.510 \--\> 00:37:35.129  
P16: And then when it brought me to this page, I would select Before Separation.  
284  
00:37:35.260 \--\> 00:37:40.680  
P16: So it would show me things that are relevant to me before I separate.  
285  
00:37:40.970 \--\> 00:37:44.889  
P16: Before I go through that process.  
286  
00:37:45.030 \--\> 00:37:52.099  
P16: And I would still… I think this is a really great… this is a really great one here, the state benefits.  
287  
00:37:54.170 \--\> 00:38:01.340  
P16: because it does vary state by state for certain things, I would… I would utilize that as well.  
288  
00:38:02.660 \--\> 00:38:15.970  
P16: Because they may be moving, we thought, you know, they may be… you know, when I got out of the service, I did not immediately come back to my home state. I lived in Tennessee for a while, and I had never lived there, so…  
289  
00:38:16.120 \--\> 00:38:21.239  
P16: If I had known about this at the time, I definitely would have utilized that.  
290  
00:38:24.420 \--\> 00:38:29.270  
Moderator: What do you think VA should know about your experience applying for benefits?  
291  
00:38:29.410 \--\> 00:38:30.950  
Moderator: As a… as a veteran.  
292  
00:38:35.140 \--\> 00:38:37.079  
P16: My personal experience?  
293  
00:38:37.980 \--\> 00:38:48.669  
Moderator: Yeah, and you don't… you don't have to… if it's… I know for some… for some people, that's a… it's a little bit of feedback. For some people, it's a lot of feedback. You can share what you're comfortable sharing.  
294  
00:38:48.670 \--\> 00:38:52.989  
P16: Okay, so I, I think I was pretty lucky,  
295  
00:38:53.510 \--\> 00:39:04.070  
P16: I had… I was in the Army, and I forget what they call it, but I… it was… it's a program that you're in before you separate, and I had a VA, rep  
296  
00:39:04.180 \--\> 00:39:11.940  
P16: At that class, and… gosh, it was, like, a week before I separated, and they had told me…  
297  
00:39:12.250 \--\> 00:39:23.679  
P16: I was able to file a claim, actually, before I separated. So, for me, personally, that was really helpful, because I got my rating within a year.  
298  
00:39:23.960 \--\> 00:39:28.580  
P16: Now, I know a lot of veterans, especially the older ones.  
299  
00:39:28.810 \--\> 00:39:32.359  
P16: They didn't have the kind of programs that they have now.  
300  
00:39:33.140 \--\> 00:39:40.800  
P16: And so they go years and years without knowing they're entitled, and it's really sad, but…  
301  
00:39:41.230 \--\> 00:40:01.090  
P16: you know, I think having this information for them is a really great tool. But I… I was one of the lucky ones that was able to file before, before I got out, and I did know quite a bit, just because, because of that program that the Army had, that transition program.  
302  
00:40:02.460 \--\> 00:40:16.560  
Moderator: I'm, I'm really… I'm really happy to hear that. And, you know, I've helped, I've helped family members who are older, who've been, you know, out of… out of the Army, out of the Navy for years.  
303  
00:40:16.760 \--\> 00:40:21.029  
P16: Who are leaving a lot of support on the table, and that's…  
304  
00:40:21.280 \--\> 00:40:25.470  
Moderator: Yeah, that's what we're trying to… that's what we're trying to prevent here.  
305  
00:40:27.020 \--\> 00:40:30.250  
P16: Yeah, and so I separated in 2012\.  
306  
00:40:30.400 \--\> 00:40:43.409  
P16: So it's not that recent, either. You know, it was over a decade ago, but I still… that information was available to me. Oh, it was called ACAP. ACAP. ACAP.  
307  
00:40:43.440 \--\> 00:40:45.180  
P16: Yes, ACAP.  
308  
00:40:45.180 \--\> 00:41:06.260  
P16: And that program was… that program was amazing. We did… we practiced our resumes, they had a VA rep come in, we did little groups, we talked about what we maybe… we talked about our feelings, and, you know, things that we weren't used to doing, so I really…  
309  
00:41:06.260 \--\> 00:41:16.430  
P16: That program was really, really helpful to me, and I don't think those programs were available to veterans that are older,  
310  
00:41:16.430 \--\> 00:41:28.239  
P16: you know, like, my friend, he's, you know, in his 60s, and he's got Parkinson's, and he just got raided. You know, he didn't want to go through the stress of it all, and… but really, it's…  
311  
00:41:28.930 \--\> 00:41:37.400  
P16: it's pretty… I don't want to say it's… it's… it's simple, it's a lot simpler than, I think, than it used to be,  
312  
00:41:37.410 \--\> 00:41:55.180  
P16: you know, the DAV reps, at least where I am, they're amazing. They make the process easy. You know, I went up in rating, I went from 70 to 100, and I used a DAV rep.  
313  
00:41:55.460 \--\> 00:42:01.319  
P16: So it's not as stressful and as difficult as I think the older veterans.  
314  
00:42:02.080 \--\> 00:42:02.420  
Moderator: Amazing.  
315  
00:42:02.420 \--\> 00:42:08.970  
P16: It is. And it's really unfortunate, and it makes me really sad that a lot of them…  
316  
00:42:09.760 \--\> 00:42:12.080  
P16: Don't utilize it more.  
317  
00:42:13.150 \--\> 00:42:14.399  
Moderator: Yeah, me too.  
318  
00:42:14.870 \--\> 00:42:21.269  
Moderator: Is there anything that we could do differently with this tool to make it easier for those folks?  
319  
00:42:24.450 \--\> 00:42:30.760  
P16: And I think that specific, target population, the older folks?  
320  
00:42:31.950 \--\> 00:42:35.940  
P16: They're not gonna use it on their… they might, but they're gonna use their computer.  
321  
00:42:36.480 \--\> 00:42:42.890  
P16: And, and I think… it's laid out, I mean…  
322  
00:42:43.610 \--\> 00:42:55.439  
P16: in my opinion, I think it's laid out, I mean, they… for them, they might be interested in burial, so they'll come to this page, and they will see burial, and they will click on it, you know?  
323  
00:42:55.940 \--\> 00:43:05.379  
P16: And then it'll show, or more support, life insurance, I think it's laid out pretty well,  
324  
00:43:05.770 \--\> 00:43:10.849  
P16: they might specifically like the A to Z, feature.  
325  
00:43:12.900 \--\> 00:43:18.400  
P16: I like that there's different options for… for… You know, what…  
326  
00:43:18.670 \--\> 00:43:24.819  
P16: different people may like. You know, I may not use the A to Z, but a different veteran might like that.  
327  
00:43:24.930 \--\> 00:43:25.810  
P16: You know?  
328  
00:43:26.030 \--\> 00:43:26.580  
Moderator: Yeah.  
329  
00:43:27.300 \--\> 00:43:46.710  
Moderator: So, because you said this is helpful for you, because I know you're helping other veterans, I am putting a link to our live product. It's gonna look in the chat. It's Discover Your Benefits, it's already on VDA.gov. You can send anybody who you think might benefit from it to use that link.  
330  
00:43:46.710 \--\> 00:43:47.740  
P16: Perfect\!  
331  
00:43:48.630 \--\> 00:44:03.390  
Moderator: And the improvements that are on this page, aren't quite there yet on the live product, but they will be within a month. So, yeah, enjoy, and  
332  
00:44:04.170 \--\> 00:44:12.220  
Moderator: That is it for our interview. I have a… I have a couple of wrap-up things, and then, you can go about your day.  
333  
00:44:12.330 \--\> 00:44:22.530  
Moderator: So I want to circle back and reconfirm, if you're comfortable, if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. And to remind you, we remove all information that could be used to identify you.  
334  
00:44:23.360 \--\> 00:44:23.930  
P16: Yes.  
335  
00:44:24.540 \--\> 00:44:28.029  
Moderator: Is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?  
336  
00:44:28.430 \--\> 00:44:29.110  
P16: No.  
337  
00:44:29.610 \--\> 00:44:40.419  
Moderator: All right, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for our veterans. And finally.  
338  
00:44:40.540 \--\> 00:44:43.629  
Moderator: Perigian's going to be sending you a thank you note with a little  
339  
00:44:43.760 \--\> 00:44:50.489  
Moderator: blurb that you can pass along to other veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies, and…  
340  
00:44:50.710 \--\> 00:44:52.240  
Moderator: Thank you so much again.  
341  
00:44:52.620 \--\> 00:45:01.790  
P16: Okay, thank you so much. And yes, if, because I do know other veterans that I would like to participate in studies, so if I could just get that so I can refer them, that would be…  
342  
00:45:01.790 \--\> 00:45:17.279  
Moderator: Yeah, Perigin's gonna send it to you, and yeah, I hope to see you again for an interview, and please send anybody, you know, who you think would want to participate over, because, you know, we always need people to help us make this stuff better.  
343  
00:45:17.280 \--\> 00:45:21.399  
P16: Absolutely, and thank you all for your hard work, I appreciate it.  
344  
00:45:22.160 \--\> 00:45:23.219  
Moderator: Take care.  
345  
00:45:23.220 \--\> 00:45:24.660  
P16: Bye-bye.
