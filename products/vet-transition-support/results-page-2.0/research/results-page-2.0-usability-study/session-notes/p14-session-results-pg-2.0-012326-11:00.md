Moderator Okay.  
2  
00:00:08.189 \--\> 00:00:14.960  
Moderator I've started recording. I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  
3  
00:00:15.220 \--\> 00:00:21.950  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes, I'm comfortable. You have my permission to, record and use the information as necessary.  
4  
00:00:22.230 \--\> 00:00:26.510  
Moderator Thank you, and, including sharing clips with other VA partners.  
5  
00:00:27.150 \--\> 00:00:28.090  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes.  
6  
00:00:28.800 \--\> 00:00:34.710  
Moderator Thank you so much. Okay, that's all the intro stuff.  
7  
00:00:34.850 \--\> 00:00:41.290  
Moderator finished, let's… let's get into talking about services. So, first of all,  
8  
00:00:41.510 \--\> 00:00:45.079  
Moderator What services do you use on VA.gov, usually?  
9  
00:00:45.830 \--\> 00:00:53.170  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: On VA.gov, mostly I use the,  
10  
00:00:53.900 \--\> 00:01:18.639  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, gosh, the… how can I describe it? You know the little mobile app that you, that, that, that you have? At least, I believe it's a mobile app, okay? That's… that's the… and I believe that that's part of VA.gov, and that's the part that I use the most of, okay? Other things that I've attempted to do on VA.gov with limited, success.  
11  
00:01:18.910 \--\> 00:01:28.370  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: was downloading my medical record, okay? Because I needed to… I needed information for an appeal letter. Well, I was at the…  
12  
00:01:28.860 \--\> 00:01:48.889  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: blind rehab, center in Waco, and I had the assistance of an instructor, and we tried to download, you know, my medical record. Well, we ran into a number of obstacles. One was, was that the medical records only went back about 2 years, and then the other was, was that it kind of gave you just a…  
13  
00:01:48.950 \--\> 00:01:59.190  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: a brief snippet of what the medical records were. It wasn't all the medical records, and so we had to file  
14  
00:01:59.190 \--\> 00:02:09.230  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: To get copies of our medical records sent to us by CD. And I did that, filing on, October 29th, I think it was.  
15  
00:02:09.229 \--\> 00:02:23.310  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And I've yet to receive the CD, so I've kind of like, yeah, and then, I did use it, the other day for, filing for an application  
16  
00:02:23.310 \--\> 00:02:33.999  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: to be approved to be buried in the National Cemetery. I was really surprised how easy that was, how quickly it went through, and I did receive my acceptance letters, okay?  
17  
00:02:35.280 \--\> 00:02:52.070  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: You know, I also, tried to use VA.gov to look at letters that I had filed for claims, with, the VA, and, which all my claims were denied on, I think, October 1st.  
18  
00:02:52.070 \--\> 00:03:04.350  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And I tried to find, copies of the letters I had sent to it, because my… I had sent… that I had filed with the VBA for the, oh gosh, for the disabilities, okay?  
19  
00:03:04.350 \--\> 00:03:17.740  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: But I couldn't find them, and I spoke with my VSO, and my VSO is the Blinded Veterans Association, BVA, and, you know, they said that they didn't have access to it, and I was like, well.  
20  
00:03:17.740 \--\> 00:03:26.450  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, you've been my designated VSO now for a number of years, don't you have access to everything? And they're like, they couldn't find,  
21  
00:03:26.450 \--\> 00:03:34.019  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: they said they couldn't find it, and they asked me if I had hard copy, and I have yet to find hard copy.  
22  
00:03:34.020 \--\> 00:03:53.789  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: my filing system's not too good, because I am a legally blind person, pretty, pretty low vision. And, so anyhow, just kind of some frustration, and a little bit of surprise that my VSO is saying that they can't find the claims that I filed  
23  
00:03:53.900 \--\> 00:03:58.519  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I… I don't know. It's a little frustration on that part.  
24  
00:03:58.520 \--\> 00:04:18.209  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I also used the, VA.gov. I tried to monitor the progress of my evaluations, and I forget the name of those evaluations where you go in and some doctor kind of examines you to say yes or no on your, your disability claims and everything.  
25  
00:04:18.329 \--\> 00:04:34.199  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I was kind of able to follow along a little bit, but, then all of a sudden, everything came back in denied, and it… I don't know, it was just very depressing, very… it was just… yuck, I don't know.  
26  
00:04:34.460 \--\> 00:04:43.390  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Let's see, and then I've just tried to kind of poke around in it and look and see if I could find any information that might be helpful to me.  
27  
00:04:43.390 \--\> 00:04:46.580  
Moderator And… and I really wasn't able to disc…  
28  
00:04:46.580 \--\> 00:04:54.860  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: discover, information that was going to be helpful to me. I'm sure it's out there, but I… I just wasn't able to,  
29  
00:04:56.220 \--\> 00:05:02.580  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: To find it, you know, and I… my,  
30  
00:05:02.770 \--\> 00:05:14.069  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: on my to-do list, over this next, week or two, is to reach out to my VSO again, and kind of go over everything and see if they can find these, these,  
31  
00:05:14.650 \--\> 00:05:20.089  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: application letters that I submitted for my VBA claim, okay?  
32  
00:05:21.100 \--\> 00:05:27.520  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I hope I wasn't rambling too much, and that this is kind of the information you're looking for.  
33  
00:05:27.800 \--\> 00:05:45.590  
Moderator Now, this is, this is absolutely the kind of context that helps me understand where you are in the process, what services you're using, what benefits you might be looking for. And also, I'm sorry that you've had such a frustrating experience with claims, and,  
34  
00:05:45.890 \--\> 00:05:48.050  
Moderator Yeah, it shouldn't be that hard.  
35  
00:05:48.510 \--\> 00:05:59.300  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Well, the, you know, the really frustrating thing was, was that I, you know, I filed my claims, like, in, let's see,  
36  
00:05:59.600 \--\> 00:06:05.270  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: In… in, I think it was May, May of 2025, it was May.  
37  
00:06:05.940 \--\> 00:06:18.689  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: It was, it was the end of April, it was April 30th, April 3rd, 2025, okay? And, part of my problems is, is that, you know, I have, you know, 50%,  
38  
00:06:19.550 \--\> 00:06:29.060  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: service-connected, disability for anxiety and everything, and my doctor gave me these nexus letters, which  
39  
00:06:29.240 \--\> 00:06:44.350  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, documented that because of my anxiety, that, you know, I… caused me to gain weight and caused all sorts of other problems, diabetic retinopathy, all these other problems, right? And they gave me the nexus letter. And, in the…  
40  
00:06:44.560 \--\> 00:06:53.210  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: In the letter that I received on October the 1st, it said that the VA does not recognize  
41  
00:06:53.620 \--\> 00:06:56.740  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: My anxiety causing me to gain weight.  
42  
00:06:56.860 \--\> 00:07:16.400  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: which caused all these other problems, okay? And my doctor had even included studies which showed that this has happened, okay? Well, I received it on October 1st, as I said, and, you know, one of the things that I was learning when I was down in the blind rehab was the use of,  
43  
00:07:16.400 \--\> 00:07:22.970  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, AI, okay, specific… specifically Apple AI.  
44  
00:07:22.970 \--\> 00:07:38.439  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: ChatGBT and Perplexity. I do have a ChatGBT subscription, and on Perplexity, and Perplexity, I love Perplexity, I love the interface of it. It's really… to me, it's much better than ChatGBT.  
45  
00:07:38.450 \--\> 00:07:48.049  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And, anyhow, I sat down with it, and I said, hey, Aya, could you help me compose an appeal letter? I was doing it just as an exercise.  
46  
00:07:48.050 \--\> 00:08:04.569  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: to learn AI. And, I kind of just put in some prompts, described what happened, kind of reiterated what I've just shared with you, and the very first thing that, Perplexity came back and said, they said, oh, well, yeah, you should file an appeal letter, because on…  
47  
00:08:04.570 \--\> 00:08:29.140  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: July, I think it was July 1st, July 15th, somewhere in July of 2025, a federal court ruled against the VA and said that the VA had to recognize, obesity, okay, as a recognizable and service-connected disability, okay, which would cause all these other problems.  
48  
00:08:29.140 \--\> 00:08:29.700  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: homes.  
49  
00:08:29.760 \--\> 00:08:41.750  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And I'm like, okay, that happened in July, why did they reject me on October the 1st, you know? So, I have to put together an appeals letter and an appeals process.  
50  
00:08:41.750 \--\> 00:08:50.380  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: to, kind of go back and do all this. When I spoke with the, BVA about it, okay,  
51  
00:08:50.550 \--\> 00:09:07.510  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, they were unaware of it. They were pretty much unaware of everything I spoke to them about, and their thing was, you know, for me to put everything together and send it to them, and they would file it. And I was, like, going, gosh, I thought a VSO would create the documents, and they were like.  
52  
00:09:07.590 \--\> 00:09:25.760  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: no, they don't create documents, they just file the documents, and then they directed me to, some forms to fill out, and I'm like, okay, I'm a… I'm a low-vision, legally blind person. I… I hate it when people say, oh, go read this, or go read that. I'm like, ugh.  
53  
00:09:26.320 \--\> 00:09:27.050  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: So…  
54  
00:09:27.050 \--\> 00:09:30.170  
Moderator Yeah, like, just, just do it\! Why… why not?  
55  
00:09:30.170 \--\> 00:09:44.820  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah, well, you know, it's like, I thought that's what a VSO does, and so, if I… and I'm… I finally got back to the point here where I can start dealing… mentally prepared to start dealing with the VSO again, and I guess if,  
56  
00:09:44.870 \--\> 00:09:53.729  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: if the BVA VSO, posture is that they simply file forms that I fill out,  
57  
00:09:53.800 \--\> 00:10:12.890  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, I guess I'll have to see if I can find another VSO, but I need to find somebody who can help me fill these forms out. I can… and I… and one of the things I was going to try and do was use AI to help me create an appeals process, but for me to use the VA, or use AI to do this.  
58  
00:10:12.980 \--\> 00:10:22.070  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I need my medical records, and I haven't been able to get the complete copy of my medical records going back to the date when I first started going to the VA.  
59  
00:10:23.220 \--\> 00:10:34.090  
Moderator You know, in the context of all these things you've been dealing with, I'm so grateful that you are willing to show up and help us make this better for…  
60  
00:10:34.150 \--\> 00:10:48.150  
Moderator you know, blind and low vision and other users with disabilities, because, yeah, you're explaining exactly why we need to do this work. So, I really appreciate you.  
61  
00:10:48.420 \--\> 00:10:52.360  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I hope that I'm being focused and  
62  
00:10:52.490 \--\> 00:11:04.659  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: providing the information you're looking for. If I tend to wander off topic, or it's not applicable to what we're trying to discuss here, just put me back on course. I don't have a problem being corrected or directed.  
63  
00:11:05.850 \--\> 00:11:15.830  
Moderator Yeah, I appreciate that, but I also really want to hear your perspective on everything. I would love it if you could, like.  
64  
00:11:16.180 \--\> 00:11:19.959  
Moderator Take a pass at,  
65  
00:11:20.400 \--\> 00:11:32.929  
Moderator trying out a new tool for discovery benefits that we're working on, and I have a link for you. How would you like me to get the link to you? Is…  
66  
00:11:34.230 \--\> 00:11:39.129  
Moderator If I put it in the chat for this meeting, will that be accessible to you?  
67  
00:11:39.130 \--\> 00:11:42.409  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, and you want me to access it right now?  
68  
00:11:42.410 \--\> 00:11:46.299  
Moderator Yes, I am going to cut and paste  
69  
00:11:46.930 \--\> 00:12:00.259  
Moderator Also, oh, also, before we get started, could you please tell me about the devices and the technology you're using? Like, what device, are you going to be using Apple Accessibility, JAWS, just please tell me everything you're using.  
70  
00:12:00.260 \--\> 00:12:08.829  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, okay. Right now, I'm communicating to you with my beloved, Apple MacBook,  
71  
00:12:08.830 \--\> 00:12:21.239  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: 16-inch, MacBook Pro, computer, okay? And I'm using the applications, you know, that is on it, and I do have Zoom on it, okay? And,  
72  
00:12:21.310 \--\> 00:12:27.740  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, although I'm trained in voiceover, I find that kind of, it's… Yeah, it's…  
73  
00:12:28.050 \--\> 00:12:33.119  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you have to have a lot of patience to use it, okay? So, what I do…  
74  
00:12:33.390 \--\> 00:12:36.970  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: and I primarily do is,  
75  
00:12:37.960 \--\> 00:12:55.130  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: with the keypad and the track thing, where you can enlarge or shrink the screen, and you can move it around and stuff like that. That's principally how I do it, okay, when I'm on my MacBook. If I'm, if I'm using my iPhone.  
76  
00:12:55.130 \--\> 00:13:05.550  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: The iPhone has a number of accessibility features in it. You know, some, again, there's the magnification, there's 3 different types of magnification that.  
77  
00:13:05.550 \--\> 00:13:15.449  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Apple Accessibility provides, and then also, Apple Accessibility, allows me to do a text-to-voice conversion.  
78  
00:13:15.450 \--\> 00:13:23.429  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I… I… or translation, I should say. I primarily use my iPhone for text-to-speech.  
79  
00:13:23.430 \--\> 00:13:37.339  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Because it's right there, it's a small window, I can deal with it. The Mac has this capability to do it too, but I don't use that capability on the Mac, because  
80  
00:13:37.550 \--\> 00:13:50.270  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: the screen area of the Mac is so large, and I have to expand it so large to be able to see it, I'm sort of panning around, and I'm just sort of finding information  
81  
00:13:50.890 \--\> 00:14:03.280  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: by accident, whereas the iPhone has a much smaller real estate window that I'm looking at, a viewable window, and so it's easier for me to find information over there to make it.  
82  
00:14:03.350 \--\> 00:14:14.429  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: So, yeah, if you want to go ahead and put it in chat, I may have to ask your help for telling me, where chat is, okay? Yes.  
83  
00:14:14.430 \--\> 00:14:20.070  
Moderator So, it sounds like you're, are you using it in the browser on your MacBook?  
84  
00:14:21.850 \--\> 00:14:24.429  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: No, it's in the Zoom app itself.  
85  
00:14:24.430 \--\> 00:14:37.300  
Moderator Okay, you're using the Zoom app. Great. So, if you navigate through all of the options, and right now, are you using magnification or, or something else? Like, are you, are you.  
86  
00:14:37.300 \--\> 00:14:38.040  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Amazing.  
87  
00:14:38.040 \--\> 00:14:42.210  
Moderator Magnification is what I'm using. I found chat right here.  
88  
00:14:42.210 \--\> 00:14:42.540  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, great.  
89  
00:14:43.410 \--\> 00:14:45.770  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And I see that there's one thing in it.  
90  
00:14:45.770 \--\> 00:14:47.250  
Moderator Yep, please click on that.  
91  
00:14:47.450 \--\> 00:14:49.649  
Moderator And then share your screen.  
92  
00:14:50.090 \--\> 00:14:53.810  
Moderator And, could you please tell me what browser you're opening that in?  
93  
00:14:55.780 \--\> 00:14:57.949  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, I only use Safari.  
94  
00:14:57.950 \--\> 00:14:58.310  
Moderator Okay.  
95  
00:14:58.310 \--\> 00:15:04.070  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, it's kind of like, okay, I think this is it. I'm just gonna click on it and see where it takes me.  
96  
00:15:04.750 \--\> 00:15:05.600  
Moderator Alright.  
97  
00:15:06.870 \--\> 00:15:17.109  
Moderator When you… when you get to that window, because it is a prototype and not just the,  
98  
00:15:17.660 \--\> 00:15:20.620  
Moderator And not just the normal website, VA.gov.  
99  
00:15:20.950 \--\> 00:15:29.969  
Moderator It is going to have a green button right in the middle of the page that you need to click on before you even get to the page.  
100  
00:15:31.270 \--\> 00:15:35.010  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I'm in a page right now which says,  
101  
00:15:35.350 \--\> 00:15:48.560  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: You are about to access a development port, served by someone's, code space, and, I should also tell you, I'm, like, really colorblind. Okay, so, okay.  
102  
00:15:48.560 \--\> 00:15:49.690  
Moderator Yeah.  
103  
00:15:49.690 \--\> 00:15:53.050  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Is there a continue button? You want me to hit the continue button?  
104  
00:15:53.050 \--\> 00:16:04.680  
Moderator Yeah, let me take a look, at what that looks like when it's… and yeah, I want to acknowledge that using color as an indicator for this is super inaccessible, and…  
105  
00:16:04.680 \--\> 00:16:16.770  
Moderator This is not something that we have on our regular page, and it's not… it's not something we can… we can actually fix, but there should only… there should be two buttons. You want to click the one to the right that says continue.  
106  
00:16:16.970 \--\> 00:16:22.170  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I clicked on that one, okay, it says Discover Your Benefits, okay. Excellent.  
107  
00:16:22.670 \--\> 00:16:37.690  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Can I interject this really quick? Please don't use white on gray or gray on white. I mean, I hate that, I hate those, okay? But anyhow, let's continue on. I just wanted to interject that on that note.  
108  
00:16:37.690 \--\> 00:16:57.160  
Moderator is exactly the kind of feedback that we need, so, please keep that coming, we want to know. And before, we start looking at this and clicking around, I have a couple of questions about the technology you're using. One, how long have you been using, magnification on a map, like, the specific  
109  
00:16:57.370 \--\> 00:17:01.430  
Moderator Assistive technology that you're using right now, and magnification.  
110  
00:17:01.620 \--\> 00:17:11.539  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah, I, I, I learned this down in, Waco in, 2020\. Okay, so I've been using it since 2020\.  
111  
00:17:12.530 \--\> 00:17:26.510  
Moderator Great, and, scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the least experienced, 5 being the most experienced, where would you rate your experience using this technology?  
112  
00:17:27.890 \--\> 00:17:47.659  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Gosh, I think I would rate myself, probably a 4\. When I was, when I was down in Waco in October, I was down there for a month, okay? The, when we were going to do the exercises with AI, and there's a number of other courses. I took, like, 5 different courses.  
113  
00:17:47.660 \--\> 00:17:54.560  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: But on the AI courses, the instructors had us use our own computers, okay? And,  
114  
00:17:54.950 \--\> 00:18:10.309  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Anyhow, the instructor said that I had very good hand-to-eye coordination for navigating through with the magnification and being able to just kind of navigate through. I'm expecting, though, that  
115  
00:18:10.420 \--\> 00:18:26.110  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: my use of the computer will improve a lot. I qualify for an update on my computer, because what I have right now is a 2019 MacBook Pro, which is… has an Intel chip in it, and…  
116  
00:18:26.510 \--\> 00:18:44.689  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: no longer supported. They stopped supporting this, in December, and so I qualify for an update, but they only have, like, M4, the Apple Silicon M4 chip, and that's been, the articles that you read about it is, is this  
117  
00:18:44.690 \--\> 00:18:46.020  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: underpowered.  
118  
00:18:46.020 \--\> 00:19:09.139  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: to be able to handle the expected release of Apple Intelligence if it actually comes out in April of this year. And so, that's going to coincide with the M5 release, and the M5 is supposed to have the power to handle the AI stuff. And so they told me that in April they would upgrade my computer to an M5 MacBook Pro.  
119  
00:19:10.670 \--\> 00:19:12.470  
Moderator That sounds awesome.  
120  
00:19:12.470 \--\> 00:19:17.990  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah, if they don't… Sounds like you're gonna get to play around. If they don't cut the budget again, okay.  
121  
00:19:18.110 \--\> 00:19:34.720  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'm sorry, but go… go ahead. Oh, one other technology that I've just started using, okay? I'm not using it right now, but, you know, I thought I'd mention it to you because, it really is really good. I'm using the, Meta AI glasses.  
122  
00:19:34.750 \--\> 00:19:39.649  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And those are a real game changer when you're using documents and stuff like that.  
123  
00:19:40.330 \--\> 00:19:57.340  
Moderator I would love to return to that. I have so many questions, and I would love to return to that later in the interview. And also, my colleague just asked, and thank you so much for asking this, Jamie, are you using your AI glasses right now?  
124  
00:19:57.600 \--\> 00:20:01.039  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: No, no, I don't. I have them right here, but I'm not using them.  
125  
00:20:01.400 \--\> 00:20:03.860  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: If you want me to, I can use them.  
126  
00:20:04.580 \--\> 00:20:20.170  
Moderator I would prefer no, because then, we're gonna get more information that way about how magnification is working with the tool that we're building, because that's a… it's a more common technology that people are more likely to use.  
127  
00:20:20.890 \--\> 00:20:21.530  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
128  
00:20:21.540 \--\> 00:20:29.229  
Moderator But I would love to talk more, at the end of the interview about other technologies that,  
129  
00:20:29.240 \--\> 00:20:41.629  
Moderator that it sounds like VBA, it sounds like VA are rolling out some really interesting things to blind veterans, and would love to hear more about that. Are you able to share your screen with me, please?  
130  
00:20:42.330 \--\> 00:20:52.319  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yes, I unfortunately have to say that I'm… I don't really know how to do that. I thought it was doing it automatically.  
131  
00:20:52.320 \--\> 00:21:00.319  
Moderator if you go back to the Zoom app, and write down where you found chat, if you go over to.  
132  
00:21:00.320 \--\> 00:21:03.529  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Wait, I'm… wait, I'm not in the Zoom app right now?  
133  
00:21:03.540 \--\> 00:21:07.269  
Moderator No, will you…  
134  
00:21:07.620 \--\> 00:21:21.139  
Moderator are… it's… I can't see exactly what's going on in your computer, but it sounded to me like you had navigated from Zoom to Safari, and the easiest way to share your screen would be to go back to the Zoom app.  
135  
00:21:21.660 \--\> 00:21:22.500  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, yes.  
136  
00:21:22.500 \--\> 00:21:33.239  
Moderator where you found chat at the bottom, if you look over, like, 1, 2, there's, an icon that says share. If you click that, and then share your whole screen.  
137  
00:21:33.690 \--\> 00:21:34.550  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
138  
00:21:34.550 \--\> 00:21:37.699  
Moderator And then, when you go back to Safari, you'll be able to see it.  
139  
00:21:37.930 \--\> 00:21:50.340  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I didn't realize I'd went over to Safari. Okay. Alright, yes, now I'm back in Zoom. I'm down at the bottom window.  
140  
00:21:50.450 \--\> 00:21:52.760  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Where did you say I'm gonna find chair at?  
141  
00:21:53.110 \--\> 00:21:59.169  
Moderator So right where you found chat before, look over 2 to the right.  
142  
00:22:00.150 \--\> 00:22:01.889  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, hold on just a second.  
143  
00:22:02.640 \--\> 00:22:04.889  
Moderator And it says share, it's got an arrow on it.  
144  
00:22:05.190 \--\> 00:22:06.020  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Hmm.  
145  
00:22:06.850 \--\> 00:22:10.249  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, chat… oh, share, okay, duh.  
146  
00:22:11.240 \--\> 00:22:13.990  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, can you guys see what's going on?  
147  
00:22:15.060 \--\> 00:22:28.110  
Moderator Not yet. So you'll have to… you click share, and then you have to choose what to share. So it'll say screens, then you look down, and it should be the very first choice that says Desktop.  
148  
00:22:32.350 \--\> 00:22:36.210  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, share options, share sound?  
149  
00:22:37.070 \--\> 00:22:45.900  
Moderator Don't share sound unless you're planning on using a screen reader, and it sounds like you're not doing that at all. So, you don't need to share sound.  
150  
00:22:46.230 \--\> 00:22:52.549  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, wait a minute. Compatible… Content only.  
151  
00:22:53.990 \--\> 00:22:55.899  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Over the shoulder?  
152  
00:22:56.130 \--\> 00:22:56.680  
Moderator Hmm.  
153  
00:22:57.120 \--\> 00:22:58.340  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Well.  
154  
00:22:58.340 \--\> 00:23:06.210  
Moderator How about content only? Because over-the-shoulder would only be relevant if you had your camera on, so content.  
155  
00:23:06.210 \--\> 00:23:06.830  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah.  
156  
00:23:07.420 \--\> 00:23:12.299  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay. I've clicked on content only, okay.  
157  
00:23:12.300 \--\> 00:23:22.260  
Moderator And then there's a big blue button, it's the central button, there's only one button at the bottom of the window for, sharing options that says share on it.  
158  
00:23:22.870 \--\> 00:23:23.690  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
159  
00:23:24.620 \--\> 00:23:25.280  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: There.  
160  
00:23:25.280 \--\> 00:23:32.830  
Moderator success. I'm able to see Safari, and I'm not able to see anything else, so,  
161  
00:23:33.090 \--\> 00:23:38.030  
Moderator You, yeah, you're good, this is exactly what we need to see.  
162  
00:23:38.330 \--\> 00:23:50.009  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, okay, that's good. I should tell you the same thing. I always tell the Apple people when they give me the, oh, we cannot see anything else. I'm like, well, if you do see my bank account, do please deposit large sums of money in it.  
163  
00:23:51.890 \--\> 00:23:52.640  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Ugh.  
164  
00:23:52.750 \--\> 00:23:55.199  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'll take any help I can get.  
165  
00:23:55.200 \--\> 00:24:05.179  
Moderator You have a, you have a scrap of your email box showing, but it just says, Dear Sexton Family, and I don't… I don't see any full emails or anything.  
166  
00:24:05.180 \--\> 00:24:11.459  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I have, you know, my, my email, everything, all, everything I have is…  
167  
00:24:11.780 \--\> 00:24:16.249  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Nothing is sensitive, okay? I… yeah.  
168  
00:24:16.810 \--\> 00:24:23.629  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Listen, ICE could look at my computer, and I'd get a… I'd get a green light, okay? I keep my computer clean of everything.  
169  
00:24:23.850 \--\> 00:24:24.790  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
170  
00:24:25.210 \--\> 00:24:26.000  
Moderator Okay.  
171  
00:24:26.460 \--\> 00:24:28.060  
Moderator Yeah, so,  
172  
00:24:28.150 \--\> 00:24:42.240  
Moderator what I'd like you to do, now that you're here, is I would like you to use this webpage to explore benefits. So, you can see the tool is called Discover Your Benefits. I'd like you to use it.  
173  
00:24:42.240 \--\> 00:24:53.459  
Moderator you're exploring to see benefits, I'd like you to do it exactly what you would do if I weren't here, with the only difference is, you know, the way you've been talking and saying.  
174  
00:24:53.460 \--\> 00:25:04.290  
Moderator what you think, what you feel, what's easy, what's difficult, what you like, what you don't like, just please keep doing that, and I might stop you to ask some questions, but…  
175  
00:25:04.290 \--\> 00:25:09.339  
Moderator As much as possible, I'm just gonna let you roll through it on your own terms.  
176  
00:25:09.340 \--\> 00:25:12.320  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, so I need to go back to, no.  
177  
00:25:12.510 \--\> 00:25:15.280  
Moderator You do not need to go back.  
178  
00:25:15.890 \--\> 00:25:22.160  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, is this it? This where it says 1259? Oh, so I'm here. Okay, let's take a look and see what's here.  
179  
00:25:24.400 \--\> 00:25:31.280  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Back to the meeting, join… Schedule… Livestream…  
180  
00:25:33.080 \--\> 00:25:43.189  
Moderator It sounds like you're seeing something different than what I'm seeing, because, I… what I'm seeing on your screen is… I'm seeing a Safari…  
181  
00:25:43.900 \--\> 00:25:48.069  
Moderator I'm… actually, I'm seeing a window…  
182  
00:25:48.270 \--\> 00:25:54.029  
Moderator Are you in Zoom and not Safari? Like, are you clicked onto Zoom?  
183  
00:25:54.510 \--\> 00:26:01.549  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah, I think so, because it's saying this is being recorded, it's giving me Zoom type of information.  
184  
00:26:01.550 \--\> 00:26:04.539  
Moderator Although, when I look at the top, it does say Zoom.  
185  
00:26:04.810 \--\> 00:26:12.499  
Moderator I, I, no, I'm noticing that too. If you could… switch over to Safari,  
186  
00:26:13.740 \--\> 00:26:16.729  
Moderator Maybe you'll… you'll be seeing the webpage.  
187  
00:26:17.600 \--\> 00:26:18.340  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
188  
00:26:20.060 \--\> 00:26:22.480  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, it does say Zoom now, okay.  
189  
00:26:22.610 \--\> 00:26:24.479  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, let's see, Safari.  
190  
00:26:27.560 \--\> 00:26:29.719  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Huh. I'm in Safari.  
191  
00:26:30.990 \--\> 00:26:33.759  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Are you seeing a page with…  
192  
00:26:34.300 \--\> 00:26:38.529  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, oh, it says discover… it says Discover Your Benefits. Okay, I'm here.  
193  
00:26:38.530 \--\> 00:26:42.399  
Moderator Awesome. Okay, we're seeing the same thing, we are ready to roll.  
194  
00:26:42.400 \--\> 00:26:43.230  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
195  
00:26:52.510 \--\> 00:26:55.389  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, you want me to click on Get Started?  
196  
00:26:55.670 \--\> 00:26:56.500  
Moderator Yes.  
197  
00:27:02.540 \--\> 00:27:03.980  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: It's one of six.  
198  
00:27:20.380 \--\> 00:27:37.019  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Well, I really like that you put exactly what I want right back at the very top. That's good. I'll click on it, and yeah, I'm beyond the school thing. Plan for my transition to retirement. I'm already retired. Start a new career.

00:27:39.260 \--\> 00:27:43.280  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I thought about that, but I'm gonna uncheck it.  
200  
00:27:48.150 \--\> 00:27:51.279  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Health and well-being, that's what I'm concerned about.  
201  
00:27:51.550 \--\> 00:28:00.410  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Understanding… oh, yeah, understanding my benefits, that's a good one. Plan for my family's future.  
202  
00:28:01.130 \--\> 00:28:04.859  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, it's just my dog and myself, so…  
203  
00:28:05.680 \--\> 00:28:09.920  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I don't think I have any planning for my family's future.  
204  
00:28:18.390 \--\> 00:28:18.900  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.

P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, it's really good. It's clear. I like the black on white, that's pretty good.  
207  
00:28:33.020 \--\> 00:28:47.780  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, that's pretty good, I can see that. I like the big buttons, okay? And I like the way you have continue to the right, back to the back. That's good, I can see that.  
208  
00:28:47.880 \--\> 00:28:50.489  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay. I'm gonna hit continue.

Moderator Great.  
210  
00:28:51.900 \--\> 00:28:58.659  
Moderator Always feel free to keep going through the form and scroll around, explore.  
211  
00:28:58.660 \--\> 00:29:02.840  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay. Like you… like you would if you weren't doing a test.  
212  
00:29:03.250 \--\> 00:29:05.769  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay. And,  
213  
00:29:23.920 \--\> 00:29:35.050  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: You know, it says, if I'm having problems using this information, to contact a local VSO, are the VSOs really trained on this? Would they…  
214  
00:29:35.670 \--\> 00:29:45.890  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I guess I've just had such a negative… or not negative, such a disappointing interaction with my VSO, I'm kind of wondering if they're even trained to do this.  
215  
00:29:46.520 \--\> 00:30:01.280  
Moderator So, the answer is both yes and no, because there are hundreds of VSOs, and they vary incredibly in what they do, how they can help, and the quality of their services. So,  
216  
00:30:02.230 \--\> 00:30:05.340  
Moderator Yeah, that's…  
217  
00:30:05.830 \--\> 00:30:14.630  
Moderator It's a… it's a complicated question, and it sounds like this information is not helpful for you, because you're currently having a negative experience.  
218  
00:30:15.260 \--\> 00:30:26.299  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah, well, just the reference, just send me over to a VSO, sort of like saying, here, follow this link to a website and it'll explain it to you.  
219  
00:30:26.300 \--\> 00:30:35.570  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah, and by the way, I have run into, I did look, extensively look, I spent months trying to find a alternative VSO.  
220  
00:30:35.570 \--\> 00:30:38.719  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And the problems I ran there is,  
221  
00:30:40.020 \--\> 00:30:48.700  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Boy, some of the VSOs, like the one… there was one in Nashville, I think it was, and they had one line  
222  
00:30:48.830 \--\> 00:30:51.429  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: that went to their VSO.  
223  
00:30:51.660 \--\> 00:31:10.459  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And they could only have one conversation at a time during the day, so the line was either consistently busy, and it did not roll over to voicemail, okay? There was no connection, stuff like that. So I found that. There's also, you know, I went to contact,  
224  
00:31:10.520 \--\> 00:31:17.209  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, the tech… the, state of Texas has a veteran's assistance, and I contacted them.  
225  
00:31:17.670 \--\> 00:31:39.180  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I contacted so many of the different options they had on there, and I never, one time over a period of about 10 months, ever received a phone call back from them. A lot of the VSOs are just simply not responsive. The one that I found was the most responsive was the VFW, okay, here in the  
226  
00:31:39.180 \--\> 00:31:41.260  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Fort Worth area.  
227  
00:31:41.260 \--\> 00:31:45.759  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And, you know, and I explained my problems with them, and they said, well.  
228  
00:31:45.760 \--\> 00:31:55.669  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: continue on, with my current VSO, but if I… I come to a block where I can't move forward with them, by all means, contact them. So they're very positive.  
229  
00:31:55.740 \--\> 00:31:59.460  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, let me try and get back on this and use it, okay.  
230  
00:32:20.230 \--\> 00:32:28.059  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, this is kind of interesting. I ran into this in another survey. We're talking about the amount of time that I was in the service, okay?  
231  
00:32:28.740 \--\> 00:32:36.980  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I had… I was a 3-year RA, regular Army, okay, enlistment in 69\.  
232  
00:32:37.080 \--\> 00:32:51.709  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And then, for some additional programs, classes, and stuff like that, I extended out to 5 years, and then the program was being failed. They were asking me to go out to 7 years.  
233  
00:32:51.710 \--\> 00:32:59.149  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And, so I was, like, going, okay, what are my options? And they said, well, you fall back to year three, your enlistment.  
234  
00:32:59.640 \--\> 00:33:01.060  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And,  
235  
00:33:01.250 \--\> 00:33:16.820  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: when I fell back to my 3-year enlistment, as luck would have it, I was in the first day of early release because of the winding down of the Vietnam War, okay? So, even though I was a 3-year RA, I was only in for  
236  
00:33:16.820 \--\> 00:33:22.200  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: 2 years and 6 months. So I wish there was, like, some sort of a deal here that would,  
237  
00:33:23.500 \--\> 00:33:31.339  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, I don't know, 4 months to 3 years, huh? Okay, I'll select it, but I wish there was some way I could say I was in there for 2 and a half years.  
238  
00:33:31.490 \--\> 00:33:37.899  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, and I kept wondering where my good conduct medal was, because…  
239  
00:33:38.020 \--\> 00:33:50.919  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And, believe it or not, somewhere in VA.gov or so, I came across information that, you have to be in for a minimum of 3 years before they'll give you a good conduct. I was like, oh, I just recently found that out.  
240  
00:33:52.020 \--\> 00:33:53.770  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: He's in the army.  
241  
00:33:56.790 \--\> 00:33:57.970  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Continue.  
242  
00:34:14.830 \--\> 00:34:15.770  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Duty.  
243  
00:34:33.800 \--\> 00:34:43.560  
Moderator I noticed your mouse was going to the bar up top, and then back to the question. Can you tell me what you were thinking when you were… when you were doing that?  
244  
00:34:44.170 \--\> 00:34:46.710  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: That's interesting, because,  
245  
00:34:46.949 \--\> 00:34:55.480  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I was expecting a sort of a screen refresh, okay, because you said system would be slow, and I am getting instantaneous response.  
246  
00:34:55.480 \--\> 00:35:07.609  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: So, I didn't realize that there is… I'm on another page. It's going to another page faster than I thought it would be, so I'm going to the top to make sure,  
247  
00:35:07.690 \--\> 00:35:11.129  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: See, we're at step 3 of 6, okay?  
248  
00:35:11.700 \--\> 00:35:25.889  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: it's going… for me, it's going really fast, and so, I was expecting, like, a visual refresh, like, you know, but this is so instantaneous, I just go up to the top just to verify, yeah, I'm in a new place.  
249  
00:35:26.430 \--\> 00:35:36.179  
Moderator Mmm, I'm finding out that, slow is relevant, and, maybe I shouldn't be telling people that information at the beginning of a test, so thank you. I'm really glad I asked.  
250  
00:35:36.430 \--\> 00:35:51.720  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay. Yeah, no, but I mean, boy, the response on this is really good. Okay. And, my internet speed is the lowest possible, cheapest internet speed you can get. So, yeah, you guys are doing really well. Okay.  
251  
00:35:51.720 \--\> 00:36:00.719  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And the clarity of our, voice connection, stuff like that, it's really good, good clarity here. Let's see, how long ago did you separate from…  
252  
00:36:01.000 \--\> 00:36:02.900  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Or retire from the service.  
253  
00:36:08.590 \--\> 00:36:10.630  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Hmm, that's been over 3 years.  
254  
00:36:13.390 \--\> 00:36:19.570  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: You know, watch when I click on it, it's just like, boom. Okay. Yeah, it's really, it's really good.  
255  
00:36:20.240 \--\> 00:36:24.019  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: It was the highest character of discharge. Oh.  
256  
00:36:24.780 \--\> 00:36:27.169  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, let's see if I get selected here.  
257  
00:36:28.160 \--\> 00:36:31.300  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I gotta go all the way over here, I bet. Yep.  
258  
00:36:33.970 \--\> 00:36:39.530  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: It would have been nice if I could have selected the down arrows over on the left side of the bar.

Moderator Hmm.  
260  
00:36:40.670 \--\> 00:36:42.989  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: So I didn't have to scroll all the way over here.  
261  
00:36:44.730 \--\> 00:36:49.219  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, that's interesting. Okay, hmm, saying go back.  
262  
00:36:49.630 \--\> 00:36:50.670  
Moderator Interesting.  
263  
00:36:50.670 \--\> 00:36:51.500  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
264  
00:36:51.750 \--\> 00:36:59.220  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And, okay, I've clicked… select is not an option, and you go over to the right, and you click the  
265  
00:36:59.550 \--\> 00:37:03.260  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Down arrow button, and let's see…  
266  
00:37:04.290 \--\> 00:37:07.209  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Nothing's happening. It did happen for a moment.  
267  
00:37:09.250 \--\> 00:37:13.819  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Huh, for some reason, now when I click those buttons, nothing is happening.  
268  
00:37:14.270 \--\> 00:37:21.190  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: So, I'm expecting a pop-up selection window that's gonna say, honorable or something.  
269  
00:37:21.410 \--\> 00:37:26.750  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: But I'm not getting any responses. Is that normal? Is that what's happening?  
270  
00:37:28.370 \--\> 00:37:41.779  
Moderator I want to see what keeps happening for you. That's not how it's supposed to work, but I would… I would love to see what you can do to, what… what things you try to…  
271  
00:37:42.410 \--\> 00:37:44.489  
Moderator You know, continue.  
272  
00:37:52.740 \--\> 00:37:55.070  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Unless you learn more about the discharge  
273  
00:37:55.680 \--\> 00:37:59.370  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: upgrade process… okay, I don't think that applies to me.  
274  
00:37:59.510 \--\> 00:38:07.620  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: So I guess, at this point, I… I…  
275  
00:38:07.780 \--\> 00:38:10.169  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I would look for report and error.  
276  
00:38:20.170 \--\> 00:38:24.860  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, probably I would go to the feedback thing here and say, this is not working.  
277  
00:38:25.900 \--\> 00:38:27.480  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Do you want me to do that?  
278  
00:38:27.480 \--\> 00:38:31.310

P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
280  
00:38:32.960 \--\> 00:38:35.980

282  
00:38:40.600 \--\> 00:38:47.460  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I don't know what's going on, but on this page here, feedback's not working, and  
283  
00:38:48.630 \--\> 00:38:56.040  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I can't select that I… Okay, it started to work. If somebody refreshed it… Okay.  
284  
00:38:56.570 \--\> 00:38:58.910  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Let me see what my options are.  
285  
00:39:01.310 \--\> 00:39:03.230  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, yeah, definitely honorable.  
286  
00:39:03.910 \--\> 00:39:04.860  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
287  
00:39:05.450 \--\> 00:39:07.269  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Alright, that worked in.  
288  
00:39:08.780 \--\> 00:39:10.079  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, do I… do I…  
289  
00:39:10.080 \--\> 00:39:12.999  
Moderator What's your theory about what happened just now?  
290  
00:39:13.510 \--\> 00:39:33.130  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Well, the very first thing that would, would pop into my mind is, is because you guys are listening to me mumble and kind of go through here, that you guys reset something on the system, okay? So, that's only because of where we're at. If this was a real live system and I was encountering that.  
291  
00:39:33.390 \--\> 00:39:52.169  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I would mutter something under my breath and go, oh yeah, of course, this is, you know, government provided. And I'm saying this all with a little bit of levity, don't take me too serious, but, no, of course. I would recognize that something's wrong, and, you know, if it… if I couldn't  
292  
00:39:52.330 \--\> 00:40:14.939  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: continue on that point, I would try, closing my window, okay? Probably rebooting my system, come back in, and, and hopefully, I don't know, maybe, you see these buttons all the time in surveys, it says, in fact, it's your surveys that do it. I just finished a very long one for the MVP program.  
293  
00:40:14.940 \--\> 00:40:22.299  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And it's like, save, okay, save your place in the survey. If you would have had one of those buttons, I would have went up.  
294  
00:40:22.360 \--\> 00:40:40.290  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Saved… saved the survey and where I'm at, closed everything out. I probably would have just closed out the application, then tried to come back in and see if it would have worked. If it didn't work, I would have rebooted my system, trying to clear out some caches or something like that, and  
295  
00:40:40.650 \--\> 00:40:58.519  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: You know, and then try to continue on after that. So, I guess I would put a… because this is a survey-type thing, I would put, like, a button up here that says, save your place in the survey, and then you can come back to this place. Does that make sense, what I'm trying to say?

00:41:32.750 \--\> 00:41:39.580

00:41:49.500 \--\> 00:41:54.420  
Moderator Do you… is that your assumption? That you can't have multiple selections?  
305  
00:41:54.700 \--\> 00:42:16.670  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: If it… because when I click on… I… okay, I clicked on the top one, I filed the disability, and then I click on the second one, I filed the disability claim when my claim was denied, okay? So… and as soon as I did that, it deselected the very first one. So, you know, the impression here is I cannot have multiple  
306  
00:42:16.850 \--\> 00:42:23.029  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I can't be in multiple disabilities, okay. I filed a disability claim, but haven't received…  
307  
00:42:23.280 \--\> 00:42:29.959  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: a rating, yet. That would be true of my, of my Nexus claim, okay?  
308  
00:42:30.690 \--\> 00:42:46.590  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And I haven't filed a disability claim. I would have… now, what I would do, okay, is for my situation, I feel that I qualify for the top 3, and that I should be able to have a radio button that shows I've selected all 3\.  
309  
00:42:47.620 \--\> 00:43:03.129  
Moderator you know what? You're not the first person who's mentioned this, and it makes a lot of sense, because all three things are true, and it sounds like we need to do a better job of making sure that  
310  
00:43:03.130 \--\> 00:43:13.810  
Moderator this makes sense to people who have a rating, have denied claims, and have claims in progress, like you. So, that's really helpful insight. Thank you.  
311  
00:43:13.810 \--\> 00:43:17.720  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, okay. Let's see… Continue.  
312  
00:43:18.470 \--\> 00:43:23.230  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, and… Review, okay.  
313  
00:43:28.620 \--\> 00:43:29.600  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
314  
00:43:44.650 \--\> 00:43:47.079  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, that's selected, that's good.  
315  
00:44:00.740 \--\> 00:44:10.340  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, this confirms everything. The only thing I might say is, is that, you know, there's a lot of space between what the…  
316  
00:44:10.900 \--\> 00:44:17.400  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, well, no, that's pretty reasonable. It's just me needing to do magnification, that's fine.  
317  
00:44:17.750 \--\> 00:44:18.740  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
318  
00:44:29.970 \--\> 00:44:35.779  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I just wish I wasn't having to pan to the right as much as I… I wish the distance was shorter.  
319  
00:44:36.090 \--\> 00:44:38.929  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I don't know if that… how that can be accomplished, though.  
320  
00:44:41.220 \--\> 00:44:46.939  
Moderator Do you, do you wish you were panning less for reading, or for getting to the edit button?  
321  
00:44:47.750 \--\> 00:44:49.770  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, for reading. For reading.  
322  
00:44:50.090 \--\> 00:44:58.869  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Or, in this case, there's the edit button, okay? But, yeah, getting to the edit button would be the same thing, okay?  
323  
00:44:59.790 \--\> 00:45:07.519  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: But I… the clarity, I'm able to read this thing really well, okay? So, stuck to the army.  
324  
00:45:07.670 \--\> 00:45:09.469  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: That's good, that's good.  
325  
00:45:13.690 \--\> 00:45:15.809  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Active duty, that's good.  
326  
00:45:16.640 \--\> 00:45:23.360  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Military service, oh, that's good.  
327  
00:45:24.160 \--\> 00:45:25.710  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Separation…  
328  
00:45:29.750 \--\> 00:45:40.190  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah, I'm on TikTok a lot, and you get these little things, like, do you miss the military, what do you miss about it, and stuff like that. And, it's really funny,  
329  
00:45:40.390 \--\> 00:45:44.610  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: You know, the longer you're separated, the more you miss it.  
330  
00:45:44.900 \--\> 00:45:52.729  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: If you would have asked me that question in my first year, I was like, oh no, I'm doing great. But, I'm still doing great, but,  
331  
00:45:54.270 \--\> 00:45:55.220  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah.  
332  
00:45:56.550 \--\> 00:45:58.029  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I do miss it.  
333  
00:46:01.070 \--\> 00:46:02.380  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, okay.  
334  
00:46:03.800 \--\> 00:46:05.919  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: If we accept that.  
335  
00:46:06.460 \--\> 00:46:15.720  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Privacy policy. I'll be honest with you, I would just normally just say, yeah, I've read it, even though I haven't, but since we're doing a poll thing, let me look at it and see what you guys have put up there.  
336  
00:46:16.440 \--\> 00:46:18.690  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Is this to be supplied?  
337  
00:46:18.690 \--\> 00:46:21.419  
Moderator That is just part of the prototype.  
338  
00:46:21.710 \--\> 00:46:39.349  
Moderator That's one of the… it's just malfunctioning because of the prototype. I do have a question for you about this, though. When it says it will open in a new tab, what's your response to that? Like, specifically as a screen magnification user, how does that… how does that land for you?  
339  
00:46:39.630 \--\> 00:46:42.200  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: That's kind of interesting,  
340  
00:46:44.070 \--\> 00:46:48.719  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, one, I didn't see that when I was clicking in there, okay? But,  
341  
00:46:49.950 \--\> 00:47:04.220  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: It depends on the amount of information that's being provided to me, you know? If it's just going to be a short amount of information, I would rather have a pop-up window than to go to a new Safari browser window, is that what you're asking?  
342  
00:47:04.220 \--\> 00:47:20.289  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And, okay, yeah, if it's a small amount of information, then I would just rather have it be a pop-up, okay? But if it was a significant amount of information, or I was going to be scrolling and rolling and going through it, then I would rather have it open into a separate window.  
343  
00:47:20.320 \--\> 00:47:21.400  
Moderator Okay.  
344  
00:47:22.300 \--\> 00:47:23.000  
Moderator Got it.  
345  
00:47:23.250 \--\> 00:47:24.050  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
346  
00:47:24.830 \--\> 00:47:29.549  
Moderator If you could please go back to the form.  
347  
00:47:29.830 \--\> 00:47:37.070  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah, I'm looking to see how to do that. I was seeing if there's a back thing here, or I have to use the back button off of Safari.  
348  
00:48:02.100 \--\> 00:48:06.099  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: It looks like I'm gonna have to use the back button off of Safari.  
349  
00:48:06.360 \--\> 00:48:13.719  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: But I would normally be looking for those little back buttons.  
350  
00:48:14.600 \--\> 00:48:22.620  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: up here, but there's, like, a black window saying, this meeting is being recorded. Is that covering up my back buttons?  
351  
00:48:23.870 \--\> 00:48:28.019  
Moderator I'm not able to see the black window that says this meeting is being recorded.  
352  
00:48:28.230 \--\> 00:48:32.630  
Moderator Okay, you know how insofari you've got the three little dots right there, the red… Yep.  
353  
00:48:32.630 \--\> 00:48:39.250  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yep, okay. Immediately to the right of it, there's… it goes all the way across my,  
354  
00:48:39.510 \--\> 00:48:51.100  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: screen, it says, it's a black with white lettering, and solid black bar, and it says, this meeting is being recorded. So, I don't get to see that information.  
355  
00:48:51.250 \--\> 00:48:56.899  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I guess at this point, I don't know how to do a back function. I'd need to ask for help.  
356  
00:48:56.900 \--\> 00:49:05.350  
Moderator There… yeah, that's really good to know. There is a way to make that bar go away, which is at the right of the bar, there's an X.  
357  
00:49:05.910 \--\> 00:49:07.460  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, let's see…  
358  
00:49:14.420 \--\> 00:49:23.679  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: at the right of the bar, mine just says, okay, so this must be an acknowledgement, so if I click on it, it'll go away? Yep. I just clicked on it.  
359  
00:49:24.790 \--\> 00:49:28.129  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay… It is going away.  
360  
00:49:29.340 \--\> 00:49:32.729  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And I'll see if that's where my back buttons are.  
361  
00:49:44.300 \--\> 00:49:47.350  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Hmm. Oh, yeah, here they are. Okay.  
362  
00:49:47.970 \--\> 00:49:48.930  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Found it.  
363  
00:49:50.370 \--\> 00:49:53.610  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Thank you for the, letting me know about that.  
364  
00:49:54.020 \--\> 00:49:54.750  
Moderator Yeah, no problem.  
365  
00:49:54.750 \--\> 00:49:55.370  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: button.  
366  
00:49:58.460 \--\> 00:50:02.169  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, so, now I'm back down here…  
367  
00:50:14.390 \--\> 00:50:15.320  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Discharge.  
368  
00:50:38.340 \--\> 00:50:45.849  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And on the disability, are you, are you guys looking for the information about,  
369  
00:50:48.610 \--\> 00:50:54.189  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: What it was, what our percentage ratings… you're just looking just for a statement.  
370  
00:50:54.900 \--\> 00:51:12.519  
Moderator So, the only information we need is the information that you have or not have a rating. We can talk more about the details of that after we look at the next page, because I, I'm gonna have some follow-up questions about that.  
371  
00:51:12.800 \--\> 00:51:13.530  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
372  
00:51:20.030 \--\> 00:51:26.409  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay… And I'm going to just submit the form.  
373  
00:51:27.600 \--\> 00:51:28.739  
Moderator Yep, go for it.  
374  
00:51:29.030 \--\> 00:51:29.920  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
375  
00:51:32.470 \--\> 00:51:34.589  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And it's giving me filters.  
376  
00:51:43.540 \--\> 00:51:44.980  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Recommended for you.  
377  
00:51:45.720 \--\> 00:51:48.629  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: All results. Oh, that's good to have a filter.  
378  
00:51:58.440 \--\> 00:52:00.090  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: There's remote results.  
379  
00:52:17.690 \--\> 00:52:28.890  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, on the expiration date, okay, the soonest first, I'm not sure what that is that I would be looking at. Again, that's probably because I'm panning around.  
380  
00:52:29.050 \--\> 00:52:32.380  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I don't see the big overview yet.  
381  
00:52:33.010 \--\> 00:52:33.870  
Moderator Hmm.  
382  
00:52:33.870 \--\> 00:52:37.590  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And let's see, showing 1 of 12… one of…  
383  
00:52:37.910 \--\> 00:52:44.039  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Showing 1 of 10 and 12, that's kind of nice, okay. Alright, okay, I'm… let's see…  
384  
00:52:44.800 \--\> 00:52:47.260  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Recommended for you is disability.  
385  
00:52:47.830 \--\> 00:52:50.970  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: You may qualify for VA disability  
386  
00:52:52.360 \--\> 00:52:53.940  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I can't see anything, but…  
387  
00:52:53.940 \--\> 00:53:01.209  
Moderator I have a question for you. So, when you looked… you saw the title that said your results. What were you expecting was going to be in this section?  
388  
00:53:01.520 \--\> 00:53:03.350  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, I honestly didn't know.  
389  
00:53:04.550 \--\> 00:53:20.039  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I had no idea what the results are, it's just, I'm trying to find out what they are, okay? But when it says your results, and then the next thing I saw was, is that there's expiration, expiration date, so,  
390  
00:53:20.300 \--\> 00:53:39.339  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: whatever the results are, it means they must be time-sensitive, or date sensitive, so probably, you know, you're looking for me, you're gonna give me a recommendation, and I've got to do it in a certain amount of time, okay? So I want to see the expiration date there, okay?  
391  
00:53:40.940 \--\> 00:53:57.809  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And then after that, you're giving me, showing 1 of 10, and then 12 results. I like that, that was good, okay. Then recommended for me was the disability compensation. I may qualify for disability conversation, but I can't get over…  
392  
00:53:57.940 \--\> 00:53:59.469  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I have,  
393  
00:53:59.590 \--\> 00:54:04.690  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Over on the right-hand side of my screen, I have a big black bar that says,  
394  
00:54:06.260 \--\> 00:54:16.980  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: it has something to do with Zoom, because it's saying… it's gotta be the Zoom thing, okay, because it's saying, my name, Perigen, I don't know how to pronounce your company's name.  
395  
00:54:16.980 \--\> 00:54:17.940  
Moderator Oh, okay.  
396  
00:54:17.940 \--\> 00:54:18.740  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
397  
00:54:18.740 \--\> 00:54:19.360  
Moderator That's true.  
398  
00:54:19.610 \--\> 00:54:21.890  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Blocking out my ability to see.  
399  
00:54:21.890 \--\> 00:54:34.040  
Moderator One thing you could try is if you grab that bar with your mouse and move it to the bottom left of your screen, it might get it out of the way of the things you actually want to read.  
400  
00:54:34.230 \--\> 00:54:41.759  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay. Well, when I go to scroll up to it, you know, now there's some icons which come up which  
401  
00:54:42.120 \--\> 00:54:50.250  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I guess it's, telling me I can… I can have tiles. Okay, that's what it seems to be. Tiles.  
402  
00:54:50.900 \--\> 00:54:55.600  
Moderator Oh, so it's telling you how you can have Zoom displayed to you.  
403  
00:54:56.940 \--\> 00:55:02.970  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: So, if I select the single tile, will that put it underneath everything, and I just scroll down to it?  
404  
00:55:03.230 \--\> 00:55:07.720  
Moderator If… let's see…  
405  
00:55:11.040 \--\> 00:55:19.279  
Moderator What you could try first is, grab the whole thing and drag it to the bottom left of your screen.  
406  
00:55:21.690 \--\> 00:55:23.159  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I can do that.  
407  
00:55:23.390 \--\> 00:55:24.989  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Let's see what happened to it.  
408  
00:55:25.270 \--\> 00:55:27.049  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: It just disappeared.  
409  
00:55:27.380 \--\> 00:55:28.620  
Moderator Oh, well, that's good.  
410  
00:55:29.220 \--\> 00:55:31.630  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: No, it's down at the bottom of the screen. Okay.  
411  
00:55:31.630 \--\> 00:55:32.510  
Moderator Okay, great.  
412  
00:55:32.510 \--\> 00:55:37.360  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Great, okay, so… that's okay, that's fine down there I can do this.  
413  
00:55:37.570 \--\> 00:55:46.129  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, so now I'm back over to, doing this disability compensation. I may qualify for…  
414  
00:55:46.260 \--\> 00:55:48.860  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Like, chronic illness or injury.

00:56:48.100 \--\> 00:56:52.700  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: On this page… Get a VA disposed…  
423  
00:56:53.600 \--\> 00:57:00.190  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, get VAE disability compensation. Manage your veterans, Disability benefits.  
424  
00:57:00.770 \--\> 00:57:03.040  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: More information and resources.  
425  
00:57:03.200 \--\> 00:57:09.459  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Other VA benefits and services. Okay, let's see what it says. Get the compensation.  
426  
00:57:10.140 \--\> 00:57:12.450  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, clarifies.  
427  
00:57:12.580 \--\> 00:57:13.460  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: claim.  
428  
00:57:17.120 \--\> 00:57:23.929  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: file a claim online. I think I did that, and then they said that they can't find it.  
429  
00:57:27.720 \--\> 00:57:33.229  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Survivor-independent conversation? Yeah, it's just my dog, so I'm…  
430  
00:57:35.040 \--\> 00:57:37.909  
Moderator If only VA had benefits for pets.  
431  
00:57:38.830 \--\> 00:57:44.019  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I know, I really, yeah. You know, this is interesting,  
432  
00:57:44.290 \--\> 00:58:02.189  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: it's kind of off-topic, but I'll make it really short. The VA used to be the go-between of blinded veterans and surface dog, schools, okay? And they would handle all the paperwork, schedule you, get you a dog, and everything like that.  
433  
00:58:02.270 \--\> 00:58:06.600  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: As part of the VA  
434  
00:58:10.230 \--\> 00:58:17.560  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: funding… thing, what's, what's the word I'm looking for? The reduction in,  
435  
00:58:19.070 \--\> 00:58:33.730  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: where Elon Musk came in and took all the money from the VA, okay, and reduced it and stuff like that. The VA no longer provides that, okay? If you're a blinded veteran, or even if you just need a service dog or whatever, you're on your own.  
436  
00:58:33.850 \--\> 00:58:52.439  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you've got to go out and handle all the different paperworks, and all the paperwork is different for every school, and you have to qualify and be able to get a dog, and you have to handle all that stuff before the VA used to do it, and now you're on your own. The only good thing that they did was, was that  
437  
00:58:52.730 \--\> 00:58:59.590  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: if you're successful and you get a dog, okay, the VA will pay for its,  
438  
00:59:00.850 \--\> 00:59:09.409  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: health benefits and stuff like that. They'll take care of the dog, until the dog retires, and then…  
439  
00:59:09.660 \--\> 00:59:26.440  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I think, if I remember correctly, when the dog retires, you can either return the dog to the school, or should you choose to keep the dog, and of course you'd keep the dog, I mean, you can't… emotionally giving up a service dog is just… is incredible. But anyhow,  
440  
00:59:27.570 \--\> 00:59:49.379  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: if you do keep the dog, then you have to pay for its, health benefits and stuff like that. And it's really tough because, the dogs retire when they're 9 years old, and a lot of them live to be, you know, between 12 and 14\. And, you know, from the ages 9 to, say, 14 is when it becomes very expensive to…  
441  
00:59:49.380 \--\> 00:59:50.970  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Maintain them.  
442  
00:59:50.970 \--\> 00:59:51.500  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, okay.  
443  
00:59:51.500 \--\> 00:59:56.400  
Moderator Yeah, that… that timing is really rough, because that's… that's when the dog needs care.  
444  
00:59:56.570 \--\> 01:00:09.029  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Exactly, exactly. And I wish there was compassion on the VA's part to realize that this animal has given you the best years of its life, okay? And,  
445  
01:00:09.610 \--\> 01:00:16.529  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: It would be really good to be able to keep the dog, okay? You know, now…  
446  
01:00:16.640 \--\> 01:00:39.649  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: There's also another argument, and I can see this from the VA arguing it, and that is, is that when you return a service dog to its school, okay, they provide a retirement package for it, and it's kind of… it leads a good life, okay? But it's not leading the life with you, which it's become accustomed to, and it's served, and it's taken care of.  
447  
01:00:39.910 \--\> 01:00:51.610  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I just wish that, there was some compassion on the VA's part, where they would, you know, provide for the medical care for the dog if you kept the dog.  
448  
01:00:51.980 \--\> 01:00:56.170  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I don't know, it's… Mmm.

P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I'll move on, I'm moving away from everything. Okay, let's see.

492  
01:05:36.700 \--\> 01:05:53.349  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, when I'm looking at it right now, okay, everything is, backlit, okay, in some sort of, it could be mauve, okay, it could be pink, okay, mauve or pink is what it looks like.  
493  
01:05:55.200 \--\> 01:05:55.870  
Moderator Okay.  
494  
01:05:55.870 \--\> 01:06:09.999  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Probably pink, because, the mauve color thing has not been around for a long, long time. Kind of date yourself if you say mauve, M-A… M-A-U-V-E, or M-A-V-U-E, something like that, I can't even pronounce it.

496  
01:06:19.600 \--\> 01:06:23.079  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay. Well, the reason I happened to know what it was, was that,  
497  
01:06:23.120 \--\> 01:06:45.530  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: before I retired, when I was working for FMC Corporation, you know, I put together a data center, okay? And, when the designers came in for all their furniture and stuff like that, one of the color options we have was Mauve, okay? And, I went with it, okay? And so, I mean, really, it was a beautiful data center.  
498  
01:06:45.690 \--\> 01:06:50.509  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I say that because I was kind of instrumental in it, but, anyhow, then…  
499  
01:06:50.690 \--\> 01:07:03.149  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: After, after about 8 years of people coming up, going, oh, we need to update the color here because, you know, that color is no longer relevant, or fashionable, or whatever it was.

01:07:12.770 \--\> 01:07:16.150

507  
01:07:50.510 \--\> 01:08:06.509  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah, in fact, it goes to the… you get the little single line bar, which indicates that you… it needs to have some sort of, edit text or something like that. But when I click on it, oh, okay. It highlighted that one.  
508  
01:08:07.050 \--\> 01:08:14.520

529  
01:10:19.740 \--\> 01:10:25.819  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: disability, you know, I can tell that there's a… I don't know what that color is, but it's, like, something…  
530  
01:10:26.130 \--\> 01:10:28.340  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, there's an edit button here.  
531  
01:10:43.480 \--\> 01:10:45.300  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I'm doing something wrong.  
532  
01:10:47.810 \--\> 01:10:48.780  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Hmm…  
533  
01:10:56.010 \--\> 01:10:58.290  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: On disability, I just finished it.  
534  
01:11:03.760 \--\> 01:11:12.899  
Moderator About this, thank you so much for hanging with us, because this is, a very frustrating user experience on this page.  
535  
01:11:13.960 \--\> 01:11:18.849  
Moderator And you're really helping us by discovering some big problems.  
536  
01:11:19.380 \--\> 01:11:24.520  
Moderator Because right now, you are… you are not able… you are not able to… to complete this.  
537  
01:11:25.160 \--\> 01:11:31.590  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Right. And if it's my error, I'm sorry about that. I'm kinda… I'm not the best in the world.  
538  
01:11:31.590 \--\> 01:11:38.600  
Moderator No. This is… this is not on you, this is on us, because this has to work for you.  
539  
01:11:40.140 \--\> 01:11:40.870  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
540  
01:11:50.090 \--\> 01:11:51.200  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Yeah.  
541  
01:11:52.790 \--\> 01:11:55.640  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I, I'm just… I'm… I'm…  
542  
01:11:57.410 \--\> 01:12:03.599  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'm stuck in that proverbial two-instruction loop, so I think I would need to have assistance to get out of this.  
543  
01:12:04.550 \--\> 01:12:21.429  
Moderator Yeah, it… this is a really frustrating error. I would like to try to fix this, because there's one more thing I want to check out on the next page. If you could please scroll up, and I will guide you through clicking through the issues.  
544  
01:12:21.750 \--\> 01:12:22.560  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
545  
01:12:22.560 \--\> 01:12:26.629  
Moderator Okay, if you could scroll down just a little bit…  
546  
01:12:27.910 \--\> 01:12:38.260  
Moderator Okay, so goals looks good. So the only two that are required on this page are actually goals, and you have a goal, so please keep scrolling down.  
547  
01:12:46.070 \--\> 01:12:52.200  
Moderator And then character of discharge, you have a character of discharge.  
548  
01:12:54.300 \--\> 01:12:59.120  
Moderator And then no other questions are required, so you can just keep scrolling down.  
549  
01:13:05.140 \--\> 01:13:13.599  
Moderator Okay, looks like you've fixed all the errors, you've checked the privacy policy, so could you please hit the submit button?  
550  
01:13:14.590 \--\> 01:13:15.380  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay.  
551  
01:13:17.210 \--\> 01:13:23.859  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Hey, if I can make an observation, I've noticed that with, the rollout of,  
552  
01:13:23.970 \--\> 01:13:27.669  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, iOS 26, and  
553  
01:13:28.080 \--\> 01:13:50.789  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Macintosh, Mac OS, 26, okay? They went to, using these, like, little check signs, okay? Yeah. And use the check signs, which I think it's green to complete or whatever, and then they have a check sign, I think, for when you completed a task or something like that. But they're using these check signs for using indications.  
554  
01:13:50.790 \--\> 01:13:55.449  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I'd know that you need to have a platform  
555  
01:13:55.790 \--\> 01:14:02.130  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: agnostic? Is that the word? Okay, you need to have an agnostic platform, but…  
556  
01:14:02.370 \--\> 01:14:19.219  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I don't know what they're doing on the… what are they called those? Android systems, or Windows systems, okay? But if they're following suit, because they normally kind of follow Apple on that, maybe… maybe you kind of put some of those  
557  
01:14:20.320 \--\> 01:14:24.989  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Use some of that graphics for what people are looking for.  
558  
01:14:26.330 \--\> 01:14:38.349  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And especially when it comes to, blind people, because we are all trained on Apple products, okay? That's the… that's the go-to default platform for, visually impaired people.  
559  
01:14:39.990 \--\> 01:14:44.300  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And that's what the VA provides us, is Apple products.  
560  
01:14:44.720 \--\> 01:14:49.219  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, I'm… is… you want me on this page?  
561  
01:14:49.410 \--\> 01:15:00.649  
Moderator Yes, please. And we've just got a couple of minutes before we have to wrap up, and I want to make sure to ask one… to ask a couple of questions to wrap up. So…  
562  
01:15:02.930 \--\> 01:15:20.360  
Moderator I know that you… you saw the filters, you found the recommended for you versus all results button, you saw when to apply, you saw expiration date, and, you know, you had a little bit of a response to that about why would they be expiring, you saw the benefits.  
563  
01:15:20.550 \--\> 01:15:30.379  
Moderator So, and I know that you experienced some, some… both usability and accessibility issues on this page.  
564  
01:15:36.290 \--\> 01:15:45.569  
Moderator Would you, if the accessibility… if we fix these issues, is this something that would be useful for you?  
565  
01:15:45.710 \--\> 01:15:49.960  
Moderator as a way to understand what benefits you have at VA.  
566  
01:15:50.730 \--\> 01:16:08.260  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: I would say yes, okay? And the reason for that is, is that, one, some of the options and conditions that you brought up were applicable to me, okay? And, you know, I believe that if I was to drill down into this, I would eventually come to the information I'm looking for.  
567  
01:16:09.990 \--\> 01:16:13.919  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: And, you know, but then…  
568  
01:16:15.460 \--\> 01:16:23.070  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: the next step would be, what can I do with the information, and how can I make… how can I employ the,  
569  
01:16:23.770 \--\> 01:16:26.850  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Information, that you provide.  
570  
01:16:27.590 \--\> 01:16:32.599  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: So, I would say that there would be, like, a next step,  
571  
01:16:33.230 \--\> 01:16:44.949  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you're providing the information, but you also need to provide information to me over how I could execute that information and come up with some sort of a solution. Does that make sense, what I'm trying to say?  
572  
01:16:44.950 \--\> 01:16:52.959  
Moderator Yeah, that makes 100% sense, and I'm wondering, what kind of information do you think you would need to act on it?  
573  
01:16:53.850 \--\> 01:16:55.200  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Well…  
574  
01:16:57.200 \--\> 01:17:01.960  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: if… if the information, if I need to go to a specific,  
575  
01:17:01.980 \--\> 01:17:16.700  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: department, or something like that, okay? Including contact information, or however you get to that department. And the contact information would be really good if it was, a combination of email and phone.  
576  
01:17:16.700 \--\> 01:17:24.689  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: connections, because if one doesn't work, you have a fallback, okay? If you're gonna send me over to a VSO,  
577  
01:17:24.940 \--\> 01:17:38.759  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, I'll just, you know, I doubt if you'll be able to do this, but the database, well, it's actually doable, it's in a database. If there was some way that I could drill down to be able to find a list of…  
578  
01:17:39.230 \--\> 01:17:56.439  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: VSOs that would serve my area, and one of the things I did find out was the VSOs are geographical, okay? They only provide service in certain geographies, okay? So if there's a way to drill down to a VSO,  
579  
01:17:56.510 \--\> 01:18:00.469  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: where I could actually get contact to them, but then…  
580  
01:18:01.410 \--\> 01:18:13.510  
Moderator That is such a great insight, and I'm really sorry to, to cut you off, but we've… we've got to wrap up, because we're over time, and .  
581  
01:18:13.510 \--\> 01:18:14.340  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Sorry.  
582  
01:18:14.340 \--\> 01:18:25.339  
Moderator Oh, no, I… this is all information I really want. We just, we just have to, in the session, just because of time, and,  
583  
01:18:26.170 \--\> 01:18:40.659  
Moderator I know that you often do, do usability tests and sessions with us, and I really hope to get more insight from you in the future if you… if you sign up again.  
584  
01:18:41.590 \--\> 01:18:57.730  
Moderator Thank you so much for sharing your time and expertise with us, and you uncovered some extremely important and significant ways that we can make this tool better, and make it work better for veterans, and I really appreciate that.  
585  
01:18:58.000 \--\> 01:19:06.150  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, well, I'm glad to help. I, I enjoy, I enjoy, speaking with you guys and, trying to help out. I, you know,  
586  
01:19:06.330 \--\> 01:19:13.500  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: it's not just me, I know there's other people that, you know, run into this, and I can appreciate what you're going through as developers,  
587  
01:19:13.770 \--\> 01:19:21.710  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, my background is engineering and IT, and I used to go through and have to do all this stuff for the companies I work for, too, so I've…  
588  
01:19:22.140 \--\> 01:19:26.139  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: you know, I may not have your specific,  
589  
01:19:26.310 \--\> 01:19:29.100  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: expertise or skill set, but I've kind of…  
590  
01:19:29.360 \--\> 01:19:41.160  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: been down the path that you guys are going on, so I really applaud the fact that you're doing user studies, okay? So many other companies could really benefit by doing user studies, okay?  
591  
01:19:41.680 \--\> 01:19:58.130  
Moderator Yep, I totally agree with you. Like, this stuff has to work. This stuff, we all deserve good services, and this stuff has to work for everybody, and, you know, thank you for contributing to that. I have one more note, which is I want to circle back and confirm if you're comfortable with sharing a clip with our partners.  
592  
01:19:58.490 \--\> 01:20:00.370  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh, yes, yes I am. Okay.  
593  
01:20:00.370 \--\> 01:20:02.880  
Moderator Is there anything else you would not want us to share?  
594  
01:20:03.060 \--\> 01:20:20.060  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: No, no, I'm very open. I, you know, share the information, you know, hopefully somebody will be able to glean something out of it, and maybe, improve, or whatever they can do, okay?  
595  
01:20:20.570 \--\> 01:20:32.929  
Moderator Great. Yeah, well, thank you again. Paradin's gonna be sending you a thank you note, and I really, really appreciate… this was a… this was a great session. Thanks for your time and expertise.  
596  
01:20:33.300 \--\> 01:20:42.620  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, yeah, I'm gonna spend the rest of the idea… I'm gonna spend the rest of the day trying to figure out how to get my camp stove to work before this ice storm hits, tonight.  
597  
01:20:43.360 \--\> 01:20:49.710  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Oh man, I wish I could nerd out with you about, about camp stoves, because I have opinions, but…  
598  
01:20:49.710 \--\> 01:20:51.950  
Moderator Maybe next time. Take care.  
599  
01:20:51.950 \--\> 01:20:53.900  
P14 \[Screen magnification user\]: Okay, thank you, bye-bye.  
600  
01:20:53.900 \--\> 01:20:54.720  
Moderator Bye.
