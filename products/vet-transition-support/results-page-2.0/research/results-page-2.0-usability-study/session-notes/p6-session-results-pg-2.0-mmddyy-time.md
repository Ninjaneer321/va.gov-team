| Notes on finding sort | after being prompted went back to look at the sort feature |
| Use sort as expected? | Yes with help |
| Notes on using sort | Didn't know they expired, wasn't clear on what that meant in the sort feature, Would expect them to be ordered by type, Thought the sorted by would be under the filters, Thought the sorted by would be under the filters, didn't know benefits expire. |
| Finding filters | Yes |
| Notes on finding filters | Initially scrolled through cards, then went to filter. Noticed some features such as the before or after separation filter, saw that the recommended for you was checked, but didn't inquire about it until prompted. |
| Use filters as expected? | Yes |

| Notes on recommended vs all | With prompt explored, likes the feature |

| Notes on finding benefit information | Suggested the apply more, he was expecting the learn more to give more detail and apply button, Bolded text is jumping out first from the card but everything starting with VA isn't standing out, looks the same as they are scrolling, Recommended for you would have stood out more if it was black |
| Is this tool helpful for you in your life today? | 3 |
| Notes on helpful in life today | Said probably not, because he already has all of his benefits, but would have been helpful when transitioning or when he was active due to using education benefits. |
| Satisfaction 1-5 | 3 |
| Notes on satisfaction | Adding the apply button, adding more details at the top of the page \- also said he didn't read it so that may not be accurate, something more that pops out or is shorter. Would suggest it to be clearer on whether they can apply or not. |
| What would you change about this tool to help someone transitioning from Active Duty? | Same as above |
| What do you think VA should know about your experience getting benefits after transitioning? | He likes that everything is being centralized, would have loved this page if it was available. He would be very quick at using it after a couple times. |

00:00:06.560 \--\> 00:00:13.510  
Moderator: Okay. I've started recording. I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  
2  
00:00:13.510 \--\> 00:00:14.280  
P6: Yes.  
3  
00:00:14.880 \--\> 00:00:25.500  
Moderator: Great. Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?  
4  
00:00:25.500 \--\> 00:00:26.360  
P6: Yes.  
5  
00:00:27.590 \--\> 00:00:35.059  
Moderator: Well, we are ready, let's get started. First of all, can you tell me what services you use on VA.gov?  
6  
00:00:35.970 \--\> 00:00:40.719  
P6: I used to do it mostly for my VA benefits.  
7  
00:00:41.810 \--\> 00:00:44.920  
P6: when I need to retrieve my letter, or…  
8  
00:00:45.560 \--\> 00:00:50.169  
P6: Seeing one of the pavements coming through or something.  
9  
00:00:51.030 \--\> 00:00:54.579  
Moderator: About how often would you say that you log on to the site?  
10  
00:00:55.930 \--\> 00:00:57.560  
P6: re… most…  
11  
00:00:58.280 \--\> 00:01:07.159  
P6: I guess most recently, I have been logging on to it, because I just moved, and I have to, go and get those letters and verification, so…  
12  
00:01:07.470 \--\> 00:01:12.119  
P6: Let's say probably in the last couple of months, probably once a month.  
13  
00:01:14.060 \--\> 00:01:18.929  
Moderator: About how long have you… has it been since the first time you used VA.gov?  
14  
00:01:20.020 \--\> 00:01:24.670  
P6: Probably over 10 years? Yeah, probably over 10 years ago.  
15  
00:01:25.130 \--\> 00:01:33.859  
Moderator: Yeah. Did they have you set up the account when you were transitioning, or did you have to do that on your own after you, transitioned out of the military?  
16  
00:01:34.320 \--\> 00:01:41.519  
P6: I think I set it up while I was in the military. We had it set up in, I think it was eBenefits or something around that time.  
17  
00:01:42.720 \--\> 00:01:51.540  
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, that's, like, two versions ago, so you've… you've been through the whole progression of what it was and what it is now.  
18  
00:01:52.340 \--\> 00:02:11.000  
Moderator: Okay, so I'm going to start the test OR prototype, and I'm going to drop a link in the chat for you for this meeting. Can you tell me what browser you are using on your computer? Like, what kind of computer do you have? What browser do you have?  
19  
00:02:11.340 \--\> 00:02:14.089  
P6: I have a MacBook, so I'll be using Safari.  
20  
00:02:14.320 \--\> 00:02:15.040  
Moderator: Great.  
21  
00:02:16.020 \--\> 00:02:20.639  
Moderator: So if you could please click that link, and then share your screen with me.  
22  
00:02:21.450 \--\> 00:02:22.000  
P6: Okay.  
23  
00:02:31.360 \--\> 00:02:37.779  
Moderator: This is saying, this is a code space, it means it's a… it's a temporary prototype that we've set up for testing.  
24  
00:02:38.110 \--\> 00:02:38.950  
P6: Okay.  
25  
00:02:45.830 \--\> 00:02:46.790  
P6: I haven't moved it.  
26  
00:02:46.790 \--\> 00:02:56.360  
Moderator: I'm seeing your screen fine. Okay, so this is our prototype, and what I would like you to do here is to use this tool.  
27  
00:02:56.450 \--\> 00:03:16.280  
Moderator: to, and this is, you know, directed by you. I'd like you to do the same things you would do if you were using it on your own. The only difference is I would like you to speak out loud about what you're noticing, what you're thinking, what you're feeling, especially if something is unexpected and it's not working well.  
28  
00:03:16.460 \--\> 00:03:17.250  
P6: Okay.  
29  
00:03:17.870 \--\> 00:03:20.389  
P6: So, just navigate through it, and…  
30  
00:03:20.390 \--\> 00:03:21.480  
Moderator: Exactly.  
31  
00:03:21.480 \--\> 00:03:22.050  
P6: Goodbye.  
32  
00:03:22.420 \--\> 00:03:30.209  
P6: Well, since I'm used to it, I probably want to go straight to Get Started, but let me read it for a second, see what…  
33  
00:03:30.210 \--\> 00:03:34.210  
Moderator: And let me just stop… stop you there.  
34  
00:03:34.530 \--\> 00:03:46.469  
Moderator: you would usually just go for it and click the link, please do that, because it's really important to understand, like, how real people use it. You don't feel like you need to do anything differently, because it's a test.  
35  
00:03:46.710 \--\> 00:03:50.009  
P6: Okay, go ahead. I'll click Get Started.  
36  
00:03:50.760 \--\> 00:03:56.230  
P6: What goals do you want to accomplish? Get financial support, like, the school?  
37  
00:04:02.270 \--\> 00:04:09.370  
P6: Understand my benefits… Click continue.  
38  
00:04:12.980 \--\> 00:04:17.650  
P6: I'm not gonna be served… 3 to 10 years…  
39  
00:04:23.790 \--\> 00:04:24.910  
P6: That's no God.  
40  
00:04:28.210 \--\> 00:04:30.990  
P6: What are you gonna call to active duty?  
41  
00:04:31.940 \--\> 00:04:33.050  
P6: Yes.  
42  
00:04:35.620 \--\> 00:04:37.900  
P6: Where you call it, too.  
43  
00:04:38.090 \--\> 00:04:38.940  
P6: orders.  
44  
00:04:40.400 \--\> 00:04:42.290  
P6: Less than 3 years.  
45  
00:04:44.090 \--\> 00:04:46.339  
P6: Oh, your camera slammed renewal.  
46  
00:04:47.530 \--\> 00:04:49.860  
P6: How long did you separate?  
47  
00:04:50.790 \--\> 00:04:54.749  
P6: It was 2019, 7 years, yeah.  
48  
00:04:58.360 \--\> 00:05:05.360  
P6: What is the highest character of discharge? Honorable… Continue.  
49  
00:05:06.760 \--\> 00:05:10.100  
P6: We have a… We ain't disappear, man.  
50  
00:05:10.480 \--\> 00:05:13.210  
P6: I have found and received.  
51  
00:05:17.830 \--\> 00:05:24.749  
P6: Okay… Girls used to find some support, okay.  
52  
00:05:24.940 \--\> 00:05:28.090  
P6: So this is a… yeah, this is a review page.  
53  
00:05:29.620 \--\> 00:05:31.629  
P6: Okay, yeah, there's good.  
54  
00:05:31.630 \--\> 00:05:50.459  
Moderator: Before you go on to the next page, I want to ask about a question a couple back, that asked how long you've been serving. So I know, you did not hesitate on this at all, but, did you, did you feel like…  
55  
00:05:50.640 \--\> 00:05:58.099  
Moderator: The… the categories for how long you served, did… did that make sense to you?  
56  
00:05:58.960 \--\> 00:06:02.060  
P6: Yeah, it did, but let me look at it again.  
57  
00:06:02.560 \--\> 00:06:04.529  
P6: That stopped at 3 years, or…  
58  
00:06:06.260 \--\> 00:06:09.490  
P6: I wanna make sure… is it this one, the length of…  
59  
00:06:10.110 \--\> 00:06:10.930  
P6: service.  
60  
00:06:13.270 \--\> 00:06:15.909  
P6: Yeah, no, it made sense to me, yeah.  
61  
00:06:16.470 \--\> 00:06:26.080  
Moderator: Yeah. I noticed you didn't hesitate, but I wanted to ask about it since some of it was Title X service, and sometimes that can be more complex when you're thinking about how long you served.  
62  
00:06:26.360 \--\> 00:06:29.890  
P6: Okay, yeah. Yeah. Okay.  
63  
00:06:29.890 \--\> 00:06:32.190  
Moderator: Go ahead and do what you were about to do.  
64  
00:06:32.320 \--\> 00:06:33.200  
P6: Okay.  
65  
00:06:33.460 \--\> 00:06:37.870  
P6: I'll go ahead and submit.  
66  
00:06:42.340 \--\> 00:06:47.060  
P6: You can go back and update the assets.  
67  
00:06:48.880 \--\> 00:06:50.220  
P6: Resorts…  
68  
00:07:00.720 \--\> 00:07:04.010  
P6: I guess I did, so then I did get the,  
69  
00:07:04.150 \--\> 00:07:07.010  
P6: OVA has a law recently, too.  
70  
00:07:21.020 \--\> 00:07:25.890  
P6: Okay… I guess this test listing my benefits.  
71  
00:07:28.270 \--\> 00:07:30.240  
P6: Those consents separated.  
72  
00:07:42.460 \--\> 00:07:43.850  
P6: Okay, brilliant.  
73  
00:07:44.700 \--\> 00:07:47.579  
P6: I'm like, isn't that all I can do, right?  
74  
00:07:49.110 \--\> 00:07:52.359  
Moderator: You mean, are there other things you can choose?  
75  
00:07:52.740 \--\> 00:07:59.199  
P6: I don't know, like, I've looked through the list, and I was trying to see, is there anything else would you want me to do?  
76  
00:07:59.390 \--\> 00:08:05.269  
Moderator: Oh, yeah, so now that you've… now that you've kind of scrolled around, looked…  
77  
00:08:05.580 \--\> 00:08:12.549  
Moderator: What would you do next if you were, you know, doing this on your own, if you were exploring these benefits?  
78  
00:08:12.890 \--\> 00:08:17.450  
P6: So, right now, for me, I'll be looking for healthcare.  
79  
00:08:18.030 \--\> 00:08:21.269  
P6: When to apply.  
80  
00:08:21.880 \--\> 00:08:27.600  
P6: So, I would've took this page as I probably could go to exactly where I wanted to apply.  
81  
00:08:28.050 \--\> 00:08:29.860  
P6: Let's see if I can learn more.  
82  
00:08:32.100 \--\> 00:08:33.950  
P6: Okay, it takes you to the page.  
83  
00:08:37.000 \--\> 00:08:42.980  
P6: Behavior care… Okay, that will take you here.  
84  
00:08:44.850 \--\> 00:08:49.480  
P6: How to apply… Well, we've been looking for this right here.  
85  
00:08:52.720 \--\> 00:08:53.540  
P6: But…  
86  
00:08:53.540 \--\> 00:09:09.139  
Moderator: So, the Learn More link on the card, on the page where you started, does it make sense to you that it's sending you to lean… to learn more? Because we had a decision to make. Do we want to send to the main page, or do we want to send you to go apply?  
87  
00:09:09.330 \--\> 00:09:10.600  
Moderator: What do you think about that?  
88  
00:09:10.780 \--\> 00:09:15.770  
P6: I would say go to a… right to apply, since it did say that.  
89  
00:09:15.960 \--\> 00:09:17.050  
P6: Own it.  
90  
00:09:17.290 \--\> 00:09:21.609  
P6: Because the learn more was not intuitive, for me.  
91  
00:09:22.340 \--\> 00:09:27.680  
P6: Like I said, when I was first looking for it, I was looking for a ply button or something.  
92  
00:09:28.290 \--\> 00:09:35.680  
P6: I would have clicked learn more, I probably would have expected this to have more description pop up or something.  
93  
00:09:37.220 \--\> 00:09:46.690  
Moderator: I see. So you were expecting Learn More to, like, make it bigger, give more detail, show an apply button?  
94  
00:09:47.990 \--\> 00:09:54.560  
Moderator: So, for the order that these cards are in, how do you think they were sorted?  
95  
00:09:55.470 \--\> 00:10:07.200  
P6: Okay, let me see, so this disability… Benefits… Some school… want to have… Barrier…  
96  
00:10:11.920 \--\> 00:10:19.700  
P6: I'd say you got the important ones first. I would put the healthcare first, somewhere.  
97  
00:10:20.900 \--\> 00:10:21.600  
P6: Hmm…  
98  
00:10:22.240 \--\> 00:10:22.740  
Moderator: Yeah.  
99  
00:10:22.740 \--\> 00:10:28.629  
P6: Not many people have a business, but some do. So I guess that's good to be at the end.  
100  
00:10:32.430 \--\> 00:10:36.350  
P6: Yeah, but yeah, definitely healthcare should be somewhere on this first page.  
101  
00:10:38.560 \--\> 00:10:45.659  
P6: Yeah, disability compensation, probably the first one, then healthcare, Vice versa.  
102  
00:10:46.500 \--\> 00:10:50.649  
P6: But yeah, the rest of them, I think they're in a good, in a good spot.  
103  
00:10:52.660 \--\> 00:10:54.900  
Moderator: Would you please scroll up to the top of the page?  
104  
00:10:55.450 \--\> 00:10:56.210  
P6: Okay.  
105  
00:10:56.210 \--\> 00:11:02.080  
Moderator: So, you see where it says your results, and then it says sort. What,  
106  
00:11:02.570 \--\> 00:11:05.179  
Moderator: Did you see that initially?  
107  
00:11:05.600 \--\> 00:11:07.040  
P6: No, I did not.  
108  
00:11:07.690 \--\> 00:11:10.399  
Moderator: Yeah, I think we might have put it in the… in the wrong…  
109  
00:11:11.030 \--\> 00:11:18.740  
Moderator: Lace, can you, can you click that menu again, and… .  
110  
00:11:19.690 \--\> 00:11:20.420  
P6: to click on that.  
111  
00:11:20.420 \--\> 00:11:23.600  
Moderator: Yeah, just, like, click where it says expiration date.  
112  
00:11:23.780 \--\> 00:11:24.490  
P6: Okay.  
113  
00:11:24.730 \--\> 00:11:34.299  
Moderator: Are you more interested in seeing benefits sorted by soonest expiration date, by name, or by type of benefit?  
114  
00:11:34.770 \--\> 00:11:43.610  
P6: No, I wouldn't even know what this means, like, is it some benefits that's gonna expire for us or something? I didn't know they would expire.  
115  
00:11:44.010 \--\> 00:11:57.970  
Moderator: Only a few would do. There's a few that, when you're separating, that, for example, you can transfer your life insurance to VA, and it has to be within 180 days of separation. So.  
116  
00:11:57.970 \--\> 00:11:58.750  
P6: Joker.  
117  
00:11:59.080 \--\> 00:12:23.329  
Moderator: the expiring benefits are for people who are transitioning out of service right now. Or, you know, for some people, if you separated before 2013, then your GI Bill expires after 15 years. But for people who've separated since then, it doesn't ever expire. So, that's something that is relevant to some people, but not others.  
118  
00:12:23.410 \--\> 00:12:37.889  
Moderator: And it sounds like it's not relevant to you, so that's a really good insight, thank you. What about, if you click on that link again to expiration date, where it says name or type of benefit, which would you…  
119  
00:12:37.950 \--\> 00:12:45.010  
Moderator: how would you expect these… these to be ordered? Because you said that you thought that they were ordered by importance.  
120  
00:12:45.230 \--\> 00:12:56.860  
P6: Yeah, probably type. Type? I wouldn't say name, because I wouldn't know the name of all the benefits. Right. If I did know the name of it, though, I would probably pick this.  
121  
00:12:57.020 \--\> 00:13:06.909  
P6: But who's to say y'all would have put disability first? I probably would have thought housing grant would have been first, for instance, instead of it being…  
122  
00:13:07.290 \--\> 00:13:10.659  
P6: But, by a D instead of an H, so…  
123  
00:13:10.810 \--\> 00:13:13.419  
P6: Probably type. I probably only did type.  
124  
00:13:13.910 \--\> 00:13:14.330  
Moderator: Mmm.  
125  
00:13:14.330 \--\> 00:13:18.780  
P6: But if I knew Gee Happier, I would have been exactly looking for the Gs, but…  
126  
00:13:20.390 \--\> 00:13:30.950  
P6: Just for me, I wouldn't know what that would have been called. See, like, even this, healthcare, I would not think to go to look into V's first. I would have looked for the H first.  
127  
00:13:30.950 \--\> 00:13:37.639  
Moderator: Mmm… So, it sounds like the fact that everything is starting with VA.  
128  
00:13:37.640 \--\> 00:13:39.650  
P6: It's making it look…  
129  
00:13:39.650 \--\> 00:13:41.720  
Moderator: Them look kind of the same.  
130  
00:13:42.660 \--\> 00:13:51.150  
P6: Yeah, so that would have been, same to me. That's the only reason I wouldn't change my name. That's what I mean by that.  
131  
00:13:51.500 \--\> 00:14:06.319  
Moderator: Could you, looking at the card… okay, so if you scroll back down to disability, and you don't have to change anything up there. Okay. Okay, so looking at disability again, or also we could look at… we could look at healthcare, one of the ones that you've already mentioned.  
132  
00:14:06.420 \--\> 00:14:13.670  
Moderator: Like, okay, say, Disability Housing Grant. When you're looking at the cards, what's jumping out at you first?  
133  
00:14:15.070 \--\> 00:14:26.570  
P6: Just the title, meant to apply, and that's when I was thinking it would have an apply button. So that's the first two things I saw. I didn't even read these.  
134  
00:14:28.410 \--\> 00:14:35.439  
Moderator: And what about where it says, recommended for you, housing assistance? Are… are you noticing those?  
135  
00:14:36.190 \--\> 00:14:43.760  
P6: No, only because I think it was on their record when I first launched. Yeah, so, when it was on their record, I didn't…  
136  
00:14:44.840 \--\> 00:14:46.109  
P6: Look at it.  
137  
00:14:46.340 \--\> 00:14:48.570  
Moderator: Do you see a way to turn that on or off?  
138  
00:14:51.300 \--\> 00:14:53.999  
P6: Oh, right, yeah, the very first one.  
139  
00:14:56.010 \--\> 00:14:56.870  
P6: Okay.  
140  
00:15:00.280 \--\> 00:15:03.820  
P6: Okay, so this would have been the other one. More support?  
141  
00:15:05.910 \--\> 00:15:06.710  
P6: Hmm.  
142  
00:15:07.320 \--\> 00:15:10.220  
P6: Yeah, I do like that feature, though.  
143  
00:15:10.340 \--\> 00:15:11.000  
Moderator: Recommended.  
144  
00:15:11.000 \--\> 00:15:15.130  
P6: I would not know that there was more benefits, probably.  
145  
00:15:15.260 \--\> 00:15:18.480  
P6: Like, I did see this was checked, but…  
146  
00:15:18.650 \--\> 00:15:23.650  
P6: I would have thought it was, like, all benefits.  
147  
00:15:24.010 \--\> 00:15:26.499  
P6: Like, I would not have found this.  
148  
00:15:26.980 \--\> 00:15:30.379  
P6: If it wasn't at the end of the page, back down.  
149  
00:15:30.380 \--\> 00:15:38.800  
Moderator: Yeah. Do you… when you see that, do you know right away why the tool didn't show you how to apply for a discharge upgrade?  
150  
00:15:39.680 \--\> 00:15:43.800  
P6: Probably because they didn't apply to me based on my answers.  
151  
00:15:43.800 \--\> 00:15:55.770  
Moderator: Yeah, so, yeah, so the recommended slash not recommended, I know it's the first… it's the first one, under filters.  
152  
00:15:55.940 \--\> 00:15:58.940  
Moderator: What would have made it easier for you to find that?  
153  
00:16:00.250 \--\> 00:16:01.320  
P6: Oh.  
154  
00:16:02.310 \--\> 00:16:12.020  
P6: First, like I said, I would have had it all at first, and then, if I saw all of these, and I did, this would have stood out more.  
155  
00:16:12.520 \--\> 00:16:15.379  
P6: It's recommended for you, especially with this black.  
156  
00:16:15.520 \--\> 00:16:17.290  
P6: Background behind it.  
157  
00:16:17.640 \--\> 00:16:22.989  
P6: And I probably would have looked over here and see if I can just filter for the…  
158  
00:16:24.470 \--\> 00:16:27.370  
P6: So, probably, definitely somewhere at the top.  
159  
00:16:27.880 \--\> 00:16:30.479  
P6: If it's not the first or the second one.  
160  
00:16:30.850 \--\> 00:16:44.150  
P6: And just to say, I would have expected anything you can filter the list by, or sorted by, would be over here, too. But I see y'all titled it filters, so that's why that wouldn't be under there, okay?  
161  
00:16:44.150 \--\> 00:16:49.600  
Moderator: Yeah, so you're expecting the sorting and the filtering to be in the same column over to the left.  
162  
00:16:49.870 \--\> 00:16:50.580  
P6: Yeah.  
163  
00:16:51.010 \--\> 00:16:59.950  
Moderator: Got it. So I'd like you to interact with the filters on the left a little bit, so…  
164  
00:17:00.490 \--\> 00:17:10.710  
Moderator: If you could just select some filters, it's up to you which ones you want to select, but I would love to see how they work out for you.  
165  
00:17:10.750 \--\> 00:17:13.449  
P6: Who cares to see what it was before us?  
166  
00:17:20.200 \--\> 00:17:21.069  
P6: Okay.  
167  
00:17:22.170 \--\> 00:17:23.180  
P6: Usual.  
168  
00:17:32.890 \--\> 00:17:33.790  
P6: Let's see  
169  
00:17:43.970 \--\> 00:17:47.679  
P6: Let me ask you this, when you click Apply Filter, will they have, like, a…  
170  
00:17:48.500 \--\> 00:17:54.620  
P6: something that lets you know it changed? Because right then, I did not notice changed. I was waiting, though.  
171  
00:17:56.910 \--\> 00:18:01.230  
P6: 600\. Well… You had to catch a crook.  
172  
00:18:01.560 \--\> 00:18:04.730  
P6: Well, it didn't change because these two stayed on.  
173  
00:18:07.430 \--\> 00:18:09.060  
P6: Okay, I would've started that.  
174  
00:18:10.920 \--\> 00:18:23.700  
Moderator: Yeah, so it sounds like because when you… when you changed the filters the first couple of times, it was suggesting the same benefits for you, because they were already there.  
175  
00:18:23.840 \--\> 00:18:27.110  
Moderator: It sounds like it would be helpful to have  
176  
00:18:27.260 \--\> 00:18:34.570  
Moderator: For you to be able to tell that you would… that you need a little more response, that you've applied it, or not.  
177  
00:18:35.020 \--\> 00:18:42.310  
P6: Yeah, only because those two cars didn't change. When I first did it.  
178  
00:18:42.660 \--\> 00:18:45.509  
P6: I think it was… these might not change now.  
179  
00:18:45.910 \--\> 00:18:50.469  
P6: See, I saw that change, but I don't know which one I did.  
180  
00:18:50.610 \--\> 00:18:52.999  
P6: But, like, these two didn't change.  
181  
00:18:53.220 \--\> 00:18:55.450  
P6: And I didn't know it did.  
182  
00:18:56.350 \--\> 00:18:59.629  
P6: Like, did, like, did you… Get what I was saying, so…  
183  
00:18:59.630 \--\> 00:19:00.470  
Moderator: Yeah, I do.  
184  
00:19:00.470 \--\> 00:19:03.850  
P6: find the filter, but if I go to this and click it.  
185  
00:19:04.570 \--\> 00:19:06.879  
P6: I'm not sure if it updated or not.  
186  
00:19:07.700 \--\> 00:19:11.609  
P6: Until I… if I don't click it now, I see you went to 4\.  
187  
00:19:12.310 \--\> 00:19:13.250  
P6: But…  
188  
00:19:13.610 \--\> 00:19:21.509  
P6: Yeah, I wouldn't know it changed or not now. Eventually, I would, if I kept playing with it, but it wouldn't be intuitive.  
189  
00:19:22.790 \--\> 00:19:26.499  
P6: But that's probably just this random combination.  
190  
00:19:36.670 \--\> 00:19:44.530  
Moderator: What do you think of the filters? Like, what they're called, how many of them, do they feel complete, or do you think there's something we've left out?  
191  
00:19:47.010 \--\> 00:19:53.690  
P6: I don't know, this is… you have everything I would look for, benefit-wise. You have education, you got disability.  
192  
00:19:53.830 \--\> 00:19:58.550  
P6: Healthcare, those 3 are the main ones I probably look at.  
193  
00:20:00.590 \--\> 00:20:06.569  
P6: Probably wouldn't go to this till I'm old. Probably should do it now, but yeah. Probably wouldn't go to this one.  
194  
00:20:07.170 \--\> 00:20:12.639  
P6: Careers and employment, yeah, I'd probably go to this if I'm looking for a new job.  
195  
00:20:12.640 \--\> 00:20:13.200  
Moderator: Hmm.  
196  
00:20:13.200 \--\> 00:20:16.410  
P6: So… Housing assistant.  
197  
00:20:16.740 \--\> 00:20:20.720  
P6: I thought that was only for what you was in, but…  
198  
00:20:21.720 \--\> 00:20:29.580  
P6: I guess if you do have a disability for those ramps and stuff, so if I ever get disabled where I can't walk, maybe I'll go to this.  
199  
00:20:29.750 \--\> 00:20:33.869  
P6: Because I know they provide wraps or something on your house.  
200  
00:20:34.220 \--\> 00:20:38.580  
P6: Yeah. Life insurance, I thought this was automatic.  
201  
00:20:43.840 \--\> 00:20:50.510  
P6: But yeah, I probably need to go look into this, because I thought life insurance was automatic for veterans.  
202  
00:20:51.120 \--\> 00:20:54.749  
P6: I didn't know you had to apply, so I probably would look into this.  
203  
00:20:55.570 \--\> 00:21:03.629  
P6: More support… I'm guessing this is, like, for fishing license and stuff for the state?  
204  
00:21:04.720 \--\> 00:21:08.610  
P6: Okay, 20\.  
205  
00:21:09.320 \--\> 00:21:10.939  
P6: I don't know what this would be.  
206  
00:21:11.580 \--\> 00:21:17.599  
Moderator: Okay, and if there's one of these you want to investigate, feel free to click on it and, and look through.  
207  
00:21:19.430 \--\> 00:21:20.360  
P6: More time range.  
208  
00:21:20.360 \--\> 00:21:21.830  
Moderator: Like you did with healthcare.  
209  
00:21:21.830 \--\> 00:21:22.550  
P6: Yeah.  
210  
00:21:43.880 \--\> 00:21:48.609  
P6: Oh yeah, this is old. The latest one is 1975\.  
211  
00:21:49.140 \--\> 00:21:51.350  
P6: Wanna continue, man. Okay.  
212  
00:21:56.050 \--\> 00:21:59.239  
P6: That's probably why they never told us about this one, man.  
213  
00:22:07.670 \--\> 00:22:11.780  
P6: But yeah, that's all the ones I was curious about.  
214  
00:22:12.790 \--\> 00:22:21.589  
Moderator: Yeah, and, when you clicked on Learn More under the pension, how confident did you feel that you were going to be able to come back to this page?  
215  
00:22:24.190 \--\> 00:22:28.149  
P6: I didn't know how to use the back button, so I would have been confident.  
216  
00:22:28.540 \--\> 00:22:29.210  
Moderator: Okay, great.  
217  
00:22:29.210 \--\> 00:22:30.230  
P6: Yeah.  
218  
00:22:31.320 \--\> 00:22:35.350  
P6: Like, a bag of… was it, like, breadcrumbs on this?  
219  
00:22:35.350 \--\> 00:22:44.029  
Moderator: Yeah, well, the breadcrumbs aren't working exactly as you would expect them to right now, because it's a prototype, but yes, the back button works fine.  
220  
00:22:44.030 \--\> 00:22:57.820  
Moderator: Yeah, and I'm asking because people's answers to that vary. Sometimes people are afraid to click because they think that they're gonna have to start the quiz all over again. So, that's why I'm asking.  
221  
00:22:58.220 \--\> 00:22:59.110  
P6: Okay.  
222  
00:22:59.110 \--\> 00:23:08.840  
Moderator: So, do you have, do you have any questions for me about this, or anything else that I didn't ask about that you think I should know about, about this page?  
223  
00:23:09.810 \--\> 00:23:13.999  
P6: Let me see… let me put the switches back on with everything.  
224  
00:23:22.350 \--\> 00:23:28.639  
P6: Discover benefits… oh… Maybe something up here.  
225  
00:23:29.430 \--\> 00:23:32.190  
P6: And bold, that will say, like.  
226  
00:23:32.400 \--\> 00:23:38.540  
P6: Well, I guess it is saying discover your benefits, but I would like this… something that would let me know this is a page.  
227  
00:23:38.800 \--\> 00:23:39.430  
Moderator: Mmm.  
228  
00:23:40.370 \--\> 00:23:51.369  
P6: you're not applying, so I'm rambling, but it's a page where you can find information about your benefits book. So I guess Discover Your Benefits is that  
229  
00:23:55.870 \--\> 00:24:00.419  
P6: But if it is a page where I see all these wins to apply on everything.  
230  
00:24:01.840 \--\> 00:24:04.710  
P6: Well, it doesn't say to apply, it say when.  
231  
00:24:04.880 \--\> 00:24:07.609  
P6: So I guess this is the key word.  
232  
00:24:07.880 \--\> 00:24:08.640  
Moderator: Hmm.  
233  
00:24:10.430 \--\> 00:24:14.459  
P6: And so, well, no, I think, think, I think it's good.  
234  
00:24:18.570 \--\> 00:24:19.530  
Moderator: Oh.  
235  
00:24:19.890 \--\> 00:24:29.319  
Moderator: So, like, thinking about this tool, the resources here, things that you might be seeing that you haven't seen before, is this something that would be helpful for you now?  
236  
00:24:30.870 \--\> 00:24:36.140  
P6: Right now, probably not, because I already have my benefits, and…  
237  
00:24:37.010 \--\> 00:24:43.850  
P6: these over here, you know, I already have all of this that I need from over here. So, I probably wouldn't visit this page.  
238  
00:24:44.310 \--\> 00:24:45.770  
Moderator: But…  
239  
00:24:47.590 \--\> 00:24:54.210  
P6: I think it would… it would have been helpful when I was just trying to get my benefits when I just got out.  
240  
00:24:54.760 \--\> 00:25:01.300  
Moderator: I was just gonna ask that, whether it would be helpful when you were transitioning out of active duty.  
241  
00:25:01.300 \--\> 00:25:09.169  
P6: Yeah, or while I was in, because when I was in, I was in the National Guard, I was doing the education benefits and things like that.  
242  
00:25:09.710 \--\> 00:25:14.280  
P6: But… Now I'm a couple years out, I already can figure it out.  
243  
00:25:14.500 \--\> 00:25:19.820  
P6: all my benefits that I won't. All I got, I got already, so…  
244  
00:25:20.570 \--\> 00:25:22.699  
P6: I probably wouldn't come to this page.  
245  
00:25:23.380 \--\> 00:25:34.069  
Moderator: Thinking about what it was like when you tran- when you transitioned, would you… what would you change about this tool to be more helpful for somebody in that process?  
246  
00:25:40.470 \--\> 00:25:48.700  
P6: I like how you got that, because this is exactly where I've been living for, like… After separation,  
247  
00:25:50.110 \--\> 00:25:52.240  
P6: Wanna change anything?  
248  
00:25:53.460 \--\> 00:25:57.459  
P6: Nothing comes to mind, you know? I like how you got it laid out.  
249  
00:25:59.880 \--\> 00:26:05.009  
Moderator: Oh, what would you rate this from 1 to 5 for, you know,  
250  
00:26:05.200 \--\> 00:26:09.589  
Moderator: Satisfaction, how it feels, like, usability.  
251  
00:26:09.780 \--\> 00:26:11.189  
Moderator: How useful it is.  
252  
00:26:11.560 \--\> 00:26:14.190  
P6: Let's say… I gave it a 3\.  
253  
00:26:14.890 \--\> 00:26:16.410  
Moderator: What would make it a 5?  
254  
00:26:17.770 \--\> 00:26:21.799  
P6: Like I said, when I came, I was looking for the apply button.  
255  
00:26:24.910 \--\> 00:26:27.010  
P6: Something when I get here.  
256  
00:26:27.230 \--\> 00:26:34.710  
P6: like, discover your benefits lets me know what's gonna happen. I'm gonna learn about benefits, but… Something…  
257  
00:26:35.120 \--\> 00:26:41.260  
P6: More, but like I said, I didn't read through, so that's probably only… I still haven't read it since I've been looking at it.  
258  
00:26:41.520 \--\> 00:26:50.499  
P6: Something more that pops out shorter, maybe, that you'll read one sentence?  
259  
00:26:50.500 \--\> 00:26:52.769  
Moderator: But it's two sentences, so…  
260  
00:26:53.350 \--\> 00:26:55.360  
P6: Oh, my fault.  
261  
00:26:56.080 \--\> 00:27:08.880  
Moderator: But yeah. You know, that's really useful, because a lot of… a lot of people move through pages quickly, and you're, you know, you're telling me what would be helpful for people who are moving quickly, and that's really useful.  
262  
00:27:09.050 \--\> 00:27:20.050  
P6: Yeah, so I did see this when I got on here. It just came to my mind, and I was like, oh, well, this has got to be talking about something with the answers, and I don't want to go back and update the answers.  
263  
00:27:20.050 \--\> 00:27:20.630  
Moderator: Mmm.  
264  
00:27:20.630 \--\> 00:27:22.920  
P6: The script scrolled all the way down.  
265  
00:27:22.920 \--\> 00:27:29.790  
Moderator: So it sounds like that… that link is a little distracting. Like, it's keeping you from getting to the main part of the page.  
266  
00:27:30.030 \--\> 00:27:39.090  
P6: Yeah, it kept me from reading this if it was needed to be read, but looks like it is about, like, going back and update your answers.  
267  
00:27:39.330 \--\> 00:27:43.549  
P6: So… If y'all meant for us to see this to go back.  
268  
00:27:43.710 \--\> 00:27:45.770  
Moderator: Yeah, but…  
269  
00:27:48.000 \--\> 00:27:58.280  
P6: It is good you can go back and update your answer, but I thought we had a section before that. We reviewed it before, so… might be redundant.  
270  
00:28:03.910 \--\> 00:28:11.459  
P6: It wasn't intuitive that I had more benefits I can look at, but like you said, this is the one that I probably can only apply for.  
271  
00:28:11.880 \--\> 00:28:15.289  
P6: If I did, I'll click this and go out of it.  
272  
00:28:15.840 \--\> 00:28:21.060  
P6: On this page, that wouldn't be clear if I could apply for it or not.  
273  
00:28:21.250 \--\> 00:28:22.110  
Moderator: Foods.  
274  
00:28:22.800 \--\> 00:28:26.309  
P6: Especially since you have the ones we recommended for you.  
275  
00:28:26.740 \--\> 00:28:31.190  
P6: So, it sounds like what you're saying is that the Learn More button.  
276  
00:28:31.200 \--\> 00:28:34.870  
Moderator: Makes it so that you're not clear whether you can apply or not.  
277  
00:28:35.830 \--\> 00:28:37.699  
P6: Yeah, that too. Okay.  
278  
00:28:38.020 \--\> 00:28:38.930  
P6: Yeah.  
279  
00:28:39.800 \--\> 00:28:46.130  
P6: So, yeah, like I said, with the Learn More button, I thought this would have got bigger, and it was trying to give me some more information.  
280  
00:28:47.990 \--\> 00:28:49.110  
P6: Yeah.  
281  
00:28:49.110 \--\> 00:28:58.930  
Moderator: So, one last question, what do you think VAs should know about your experience getting benefits after transitioning out of military?  
282  
00:29:04.580 \--\> 00:29:12.070  
P6: what do I think the VA should know? Like… Yeah. What do you mean by that? Like, how the process was getting it?  
283  
00:29:12.070 \--\> 00:29:20.799  
Moderator: Yeah, what was the process of discovering, you know, discovering your benefits? Because I know you, you, you got out a while ago.  
284  
00:29:20.800 \--\> 00:29:23.340  
P6: for me, it was mostly Google,  
285  
00:29:23.560 \--\> 00:29:27.430  
P6: Because, like I said, I was back during the e-benefits days, and you know that it was.  
286  
00:29:27.430 \--\> 00:29:27.790  
Moderator: Yeah.  
287  
00:29:27.790 \--\> 00:29:31.880  
P6: And I like how everything is in one place now.  
288  
00:29:32.020 \--\> 00:29:34.760  
P6: So I use the VA mobile app mostly.  
289  
00:29:35.690 \--\> 00:29:38.670  
P6: So…  
290  
00:29:39.820 \--\> 00:29:46.650  
P6: I want your VA to know, like, I'm glad they're moving in a better direction. Everything is getting centralized.  
291  
00:29:49.260 \--\> 00:29:54.050  
P6: I would have loved this page. Like, it's way better than what we had before.  
292  
00:29:54.450 \--\> 00:29:58.149  
P6: Especially if all the benefits is on one page.  
293  
00:29:58.260 \--\> 00:30:00.980  
P6: Even if I can't apply for all of these.  
294  
00:30:01.220 \--\> 00:30:07.300  
P6: This page looks like it would have told me if I could or not, but if not, I got to learn more, so…  
295  
00:30:07.780 \--\> 00:30:14.850  
P6: After a couple times, you've been on this page 2 or 3 times, you'll know exactly what the Learn More button does.  
296  
00:30:14.960 \--\> 00:30:18.730  
P6: It was just not the first time. I was just looking for the apply button.  
297  
00:30:19.630 \--\> 00:30:20.590  
P6: But…  
298  
00:30:21.060 \--\> 00:30:28.839  
P6: after a while, I would have came back, I wouldn't know I could go to this to apply, or find it on the page that popped up, so…  
299  
00:30:31.300 \--\> 00:30:36.640  
P6: Yeah, I think that's what I'll tell you, man. I like the page, and… Yeah.  
300  
00:30:38.130 \--\> 00:30:41.980  
Moderator: Right? Well, that's all of my questions. Do you have any questions for me?  
301  
00:30:43.310 \--\> 00:30:46.880  
P6: I guess not by this, about this.  
302  
00:30:47.430 \--\> 00:30:52.299  
P6: Do y'all know that I work with you guys? I guess I'll start with that.  
303  
00:30:52.520 \--\> 00:30:55.150  
Moderator: Could you… could you say that again?  
304  
00:30:55.500 \--\> 00:30:58.259  
P6: Do you know that I work with you guys?  
305  
00:30:58.890 \--\> 00:31:04.170  
Moderator: No, you're… you're a VA employee? Yeah. Do you and Raquel know each other?  
306  
00:31:05.520 \--\> 00:31:11.290  
P6: I think I've been in a, research one with you before, Raquel, maybe?  
307  
00:31:11.400 \--\> 00:31:14.030  
Raquel: We did the training together last,  
308  
00:31:14.030 \--\> 00:31:19.129  
P6: Oh, that's where it's from, yeah. So, yep, we did a training.  
309  
00:31:20.080 \--\> 00:31:21.480  
P6: But yeah.  
310  
00:31:21.480 \--\> 00:31:22.420  
Moderator: Our world\!  
311  
00:31:22.880 \--\> 00:31:27.009  
P6: Do y'all know Annika? I guess Florence?  
312  
00:31:27.450 \--\> 00:31:29.030  
P6: Sarah Gordon?  
313  
00:31:29.210 \--\> 00:31:34.220  
P6: Anybody? Those are the researchers on our team. Athena, no?  
314  
00:31:34.720 \--\> 00:31:36.160  
Moderator: I don't know them, actually.  
315  
00:31:36.160 \--\> 00:31:36.870  
P6: Right.  
316  
00:31:37.020 \--\> 00:31:42.369  
P6: Okay, yeah, we work on the medications team on the VA side.  
317  
00:31:42.370 \--\> 00:31:47.109  
Moderator: Okay, are you in VHA or Digital Services?  
318  
00:31:47.110 \--\> 00:31:48.200  
P6: to be 18\.  
319  
00:31:48.200 \--\> 00:31:53.170  
Moderator: Oh, okay, that's why. Sometimes those… the two orgs are very siloed.  
320  
00:31:53.520 \--\> 00:32:07.060  
P6: Okay, yeah, I just wanted to do y'all work together or anything, because I did want a practice run with them, something like this before, but of course it wasn't on this, but I was just curious, but yeah, that's all the questions I had.  
321  
00:32:07.390 \--\> 00:32:08.010  
Moderator: Yeah.  
322  
00:32:08.120 \--\> 00:32:13.809  
Moderator: Yeah, I'm glad, I'm glad you shared that. It, it gives some context,  
323  
00:32:14.670 \--\> 00:32:23.659  
Moderator: Yeah, so I want to come back and circle back to reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.  
324  
00:32:24.170 \--\> 00:32:24.870  
P6: Yeah.  
325  
00:32:24.870 \--\> 00:32:36.950  
Moderator: And, just to remind you, we will remove all information that can be used to identify you before sharing. We'll only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
326  
00:32:37.340 \--\> 00:32:38.350  
P6: Okay.  
327  
00:32:38.350 \--\> 00:32:42.010  
Moderator: Is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?  
328  
00:32:42.570 \--\> 00:32:43.410  
P6: No?  
329  
00:32:43.950 \--\> 00:32:53.790  
Moderator: Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans.  
330  
00:32:53.890 \--\> 00:33:03.839  
Moderator: Finally, Perigian will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb where you can pass it along to other veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.  
331  
00:33:04.420 \--\> 00:33:06.119  
P6: Okay, thank you so much.  
332  
00:33:06.120 \--\> 00:33:08.059  
Moderator: Yeah, thank you, enjoy the rest of your day.  
333  
00:33:08.260 \--\> 00:33:09.390  
P6: YouTube, where am I?  
334  
00:33:09.390 \--\> 00:33:10.220  
Moderator: Bye.
