| Complete questionnaire easily | Yes |
| Questionnaire observations | quickly finds get started and selects a goal (understand) quickly picks other data points without needed to think, search, or calculate. reviews each entry in the accordions points out that opening privacy policy not required even though it says it is. Not mad about it, just pointing it out |
| Finding sort | No |
| Notes on finding sort | didn't look for it imediately, just scrolled through cards tells anna that it doesn't seem like there's "a pattern for how it's listed" Thinks maybe it's alphabetical (it's actually sorted by expiration) finds it after exploring a bit Points out that some things that are listed at top of expiring soon (e.g. disability) don't actually expire. Anna points out that that's because she doesn't have any expiring benefits based on her quality. |
| Use sort as expected? | No |
| Notes on using sort | Assumed that it would sort a different way already. (not sure which one she expected) At the end of interview, suggested that alphabetical should be default sort, but she also recognizes that it might be different for someone who was more recently separated. (she's been out since 2020\) |
| Finding filters | Yes |
| Notes on finding filters | She started clicking filters after scrolling down the cards for the first time. Clicked "after separation" and noticed nothing happened. But she responded that she thinks her initial answers to DYB would already have filtered those things out. |

| Found benefit information easily | Yes |
| Notes on finding benefit information | used vet's pref for USAJobs, anna asks Qs about card there See's title first, then to when to apply. (looks at headings before other areas) Doesn't remember if this what she used when was on usajobs. Never engaged with VetsSuccess before now (later said that she thinks she heard about it during TAP, but didn't think it applied to her). Would've expected either description OR application; not really sure. Feels ok clicking through (not worrying about losing results) Had never heard of discharge upgrade (she has honorable) |
| Is this tool helpful for you in your life today? | Yes |
| Notes on helpful in life today | Yes, but it would've been even more helpful when she transferred out. Though she indicated in another response that she feels like she's heard of most VA benefits that she would be eligible for. (didn't give a rating) "Thank you for developing this website; I'm sure it will be helpful in the future." (at end of interview) |
| Satisfaction 1-5 | 5 |
| Notes on satisfaction | "looks pretty good and has everything in one area" |
| What would you change about this tool to help someone transitioning from Active Duty? | Having resources and knowing where to look was the hard part for her. |
| What do you think VA should know about your experience getting benefits after transitioning? | She transitioned during COVID and it was difficult (slow, not a lot of resources), so she doesn't know if there's a lot she can offer, since anything would be an improvement. Some people weren't able to get out during covid |

| Recording consent | Yes |
| Consent to share clips | No |

Moderator: I've started recording. I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  
2  
00:00:13.740 \--\> 00:00:14.780  
P11: Yes.  
3  
00:00:15.050 \--\> 00:00:25.860  
Moderator: And you said you do not want to use recorded clips to share with VA partners, and could you please restate that for the record?  
4  
00:00:26.570 \--\> 00:00:31.160  
P11: I do not want to share recorded clips for voice prompts… clips.  
5  
00:00:31.570 \--\> 00:00:46.299  
Moderator: Yeah, great. We will not do that. Okay, so let's get started on testing this product. First, can you tell me a little bit about how you usually use VA.gov? What services?  
6  
00:00:47.080 \--\> 00:00:56.530  
P11: Just for the medical, to view, my medical stuff, and, renew medications.

Moderator: And, how often do you log on?  
8  
00:01:01.830 \--\> 00:01:05.570  
P11: Maybe, like, once a month, once every other month.  
9  
00:01:06.640 \--\> 00:01:07.320  
Moderator: Great.  
10  
00:01:07.660 \--\> 00:01:13.379  
Moderator: Have you ever interacted with the Discover Your Benefits tool before, or seen it?  
11  
00:01:14.080 \--\> 00:01:18.229  
P11: I don't think… I think maybe? I don't remember.  
12  
00:01:18.700 \--\> 00:01:34.630  
Moderator: Well, great. Whether you did or whether you didn't, it'll be great to get your perspective on it. So, I put a link in the chat, so please click on that and then share your screen. Also, what kind of computer and what browser are you on?  
13  
00:01:35.340 \--\> 00:01:40.870  
P11: I'm using Lenovo, and I am using… Firefox?  
14  
00:01:41.110 \--\> 00:01:42.410  
Moderator: Firefox, great.  
15  
00:01:42.410 \--\> 00:01:43.320  
P11: Excellent.  
16  
00:01:43.470 \--\> 00:01:46.840  
P11: Share… Cold space.  
17  
00:01:52.900 \--\> 00:01:54.400  
P11: Is this one you want me to share?  
18  
00:01:54.400 \--\> 00:01:58.610  
Moderator: Yep, exactly. If you could please click continue.  
19  
00:02:03.470 \--\> 00:02:16.740  
Moderator: We have this prototype running on Codespaces for the test, which is why it looks a little different than normal VA.gov. Okay, so this is the beginning of how you start to interact with our product, and what I would like you to do now  
20  
00:02:16.740 \--\> 00:02:32.459  
Moderator: is to go through this just like you would if you were using it on your own. The only difference is I would like you to, you know, talk out loud about what you're thinking, noticing, feeling, and especially if anything feels weird, or you're running into  
21  
00:02:32.460 \--\> 00:02:41.630  
Moderator: Problems, if you don't like the way something is written, or, you don't like where it is on the page, things like that.  
22  
00:02:41.710 \--\> 00:02:48.539  
Moderator: And otherwise, just feel free to navigate as you normally would. I will stop you for some questions.  
23  
00:02:48.850 \--\> 00:02:54.730  
Moderator: And feel free to ask any questions that you have for me.  
24  
00:02:55.530 \--\> 00:02:57.099  
P11: Do I just get started here?  
25  
00:02:57.450 \--\> 00:02:58.280  
Moderator: Yep.  
26  
00:03:01.330 \--\> 00:03:05.870  
P11: My goals… I don't understand benefits?  
27  
00:03:08.770 \--\> 00:03:10.889  
P11: The old lesson.  
28  
00:03:28.550 \--\> 00:03:32.320  
P11: Should I do, like, like, what my information is, or just randomly?  
29  
00:03:32.890 \--\> 00:03:35.449  
Moderator: Oh, your information, if you're comfortable doing that.  
30  
00:03:36.740 \--\> 00:03:43.029  
Moderator: There's not anything extremely sensitive or any personally identifiable information.  
31  
00:03:48.340 \--\> 00:03:53.309  
Moderator: But if you would like to, you know, use a persona for privacy, that's okay too.  
32  
00:04:04.000 \--\> 00:04:07.779  
P11: So I have to… well, says, it's required.  
33  
00:04:08.060 \--\> 00:04:12.710  
P11: But it's not… it's letting me click on it without clicking on the privacy policy.  
34  
00:04:13.020 \--\> 00:04:14.360  
P11: Without reading.  
35  
00:04:14.570 \--\> 00:04:15.750  
Moderator: Does that feel weird?  
36  
00:04:16.269 \--\> 00:04:20.110  
P11: I mean, I just know some websites will not let you click on it.  
37  
00:04:20.420 \--\> 00:04:24.200  
P11: Without clicking on the actual link to say that you opened it.  
38  
00:04:24.620 \--\> 00:04:29.769  
P11: I mean, it's fine. This is one… one less extra step, I guess.  
39  
00:04:37.330 \--\> 00:04:48.170  
P11: So, recommended disability housing grant, GI clear, benefits, state benefits, mental health, national, veteran readiness…  
40  
00:04:49.250 \--\> 00:04:53.869  
P11: Yay, Vet Success on Campus and Foreign Medical Program.  
41  
00:05:00.670 \--\> 00:05:02.249  
P11: really helps here.  
42  
00:05:02.380 \--\> 00:05:03.850  
P11: your life insurance.  
43  
00:05:04.210 \--\> 00:05:08.090  
P11: VA pension, and VA preference.  
44  
00:05:09.280 \--\> 00:05:10.840  
P11: So do I just click on one?  
45  
00:05:11.280 \--\> 00:05:19.620  
Moderator: So, I want to pause for a second. Now that you've scanned through this page a little bit, can you tell me what you're noticing?  
46  
00:05:20.890 \--\> 00:05:23.840  
P11: It's just things that I recommended. There's no, like…  
47  
00:05:25.010 \--\> 00:05:27.919  
P11: I guess it doesn't seem to have any…  
48  
00:05:31.750 \--\> 00:05:39.469  
P11: Thing in, like… the way that it's, I guess, like, it's listed, there's no, like,  
49  
00:05:40.740 \--\> 00:05:43.219  
P11: there's… I don't know, what's the right word? There's no…  
50  
00:05:43.660 \--\> 00:05:46.460  
P11: Doesn't seem there's a pattern to how it's listed.  
51  
00:05:46.460 \--\> 00:05:47.300  
Moderator: Mmm.  
52  
00:05:48.850 \--\> 00:05:57.090  
P11: like, disability compensation, and then there is the mental health services here, and then I think the VA,  
53  
00:05:57.280 \--\> 00:06:07.200  
P11: like, program is, like, somewhere else. Like, VA Healthcare is here, so, like, why didn't we group all the medical stuff together, or is this supposed to be, alphabetical?  
54  
00:06:08.560 \--\> 00:06:11.080  
P11: disability housing, but I guess self-medical.  
55  
00:06:11.960 \--\> 00:06:18.999  
P11: No, but that doesn't make sense when it's state veterans. Oh, I guess S-G-I-V-A. We take VA mental services.  
56  
00:06:19.100 \--\> 00:06:23.260  
P11: I guess it's… I guess it's more like the…  
57  
00:06:24.560 \--\> 00:06:29.000  
P11: alphabetical, I guess. I don't know. I don't know how it's, doing this.  
58  
00:06:29.160 \--\> 00:06:30.100  
Moderator: crowdsorted.  
59  
00:06:30.100 \--\> 00:06:34.319  
P11: Healthcare, yeah, healthcare is here, and then healthcare is also listed down here.  
60  
00:06:35.920 \--\> 00:06:41.509  
Moderator: So you're noticing that it is not sorted by type of benefit, it is not sorted alphabetically.  
61  
00:06:41.960 \--\> 00:06:48.260  
P11: Expiration date is what it's done, but how is the expiration date for disability compensation?  
62  
00:06:48.410 \--\> 00:06:53.770  
P11: expiring before anybody used them. I think you can technically get any of these at any time.  
63  
00:06:55.710 \--\> 00:06:56.380  
Moderator: Yeah.  
64  
00:06:56.380 \--\> 00:07:00.689  
P11: VA-backed home loans wouldn't technically expire, would it?  
65  
00:07:01.010 \--\> 00:07:19.169  
Moderator: Nope, it does not. Actually, none of these expire. There are some benefits that do expire. A lot of things that are around the time you separate. For example, VR\&E you can use for a certain amount of time,  
66  
00:07:19.450 \--\> 00:07:23.880  
Moderator: There's some other things, like taps, you can only do when you're in the military.  
67  
00:07:24.380 \--\> 00:07:33.139  
Moderator: So… what I'm noticing is that for somebody like you, who's already transitioned, you've been, you know, a veteran getting services for some time now.  
68  
00:07:33.620 \--\> 00:07:45.010  
Moderator: You might need some kind of visual clue to tell you that you're… you don't have any benefits that are time-sensitive. Like, you have no time-sensitive benefits, nothing is expiring for you.  
69  
00:07:46.520 \--\> 00:07:59.559  
Moderator: Okay. Also, I noticed, you didn't see the… where it says sort and then expiration date right away. You went straight to the cards. So, can you tell me when you noticed that?  
70  
00:08:00.780 \--\> 00:08:11.100  
P11: I think it was just more of when I was looking… when it said, like, the VA… foreign medical program, and it talked about the VA health stuff, and then mental health services, all a different barrier.  
71  
00:08:12.460 \--\> 00:08:20.209  
P11: I just automatically assumed that it would sort with the most, Benefits already.  
72  
00:08:23.420 \--\> 00:08:27.159  
Moderator: Yeah, that's a really great insight. That is good to know.  
73  
00:08:27.480 \--\> 00:08:39.959  
Moderator: So… Looking at the individual carts, we've got, like, for example, this one that, you have…  
74  
00:08:40.470 \--\> 00:08:50.760  
Moderator: now that you've got it sorted by A to Z, burials and memorial… cemetery burial is coming up first,  
75  
00:08:51.370 \--\> 00:09:00.390  
Moderator: I, could you actually scroll down a little bit? I want to find maybe one that you're somewhat familiar with.  
76  
00:09:03.970 \--\> 00:09:05.430  
P11: Reference on hiring?  
77  
00:09:06.020 \--\> 00:09:08.270  
Moderator: Have you interacted with that before?  
78  
00:09:09.130 \--\> 00:09:11.229  
P11: Yeah, for the USA jobs.  
79  
00:09:11.500 \--\> 00:09:14.349  
Moderator: Okay, great, so this is a good one to explore.  
80  
00:09:14.460 \--\> 00:09:21.980  
Moderator: So, looking at that card, what jumps out to you? Like, what are you seeing first? What are you seeing next?  
81  
00:09:22.530 \--\> 00:09:23.579  
P11: For when I click on it.  
82  
00:09:23.580 \--\> 00:09:25.390  
Moderator: Yeah, or, like…  
83  
00:09:25.390 \--\> 00:09:26.350  
P11: supposed to click on it?  
84  
00:09:26.610 \--\> 00:09:34.850  
Moderator: Oh, you're fine. Like, just looking at the card, where it says…  
85  
00:09:37.800 \--\> 00:09:43.339  
Moderator: Yeah, Veterans Preference and Federal. So, like, can you tell me a little bit, what are you seeing first?  
86  
00:09:44.450 \--\> 00:09:46.590  
P11: Veterans Preference and Federal Hiring?  
87  
00:09:46.870 \--\> 00:09:51.710  
Moderator: Okay, what are you seeing next? Like, how are you… how are you navigating?  
88  
00:09:52.590 \--\> 00:09:55.230  
P11: When to apply after you separate from service?  
89  
00:09:55.970 \--\> 00:10:02.670  
Moderator: Got it. So your… your eye… it sounds like your eyes are going straight to the headings, and then you're seeing the other stuff on the page.  
90  
00:10:04.230 \--\> 00:10:09.040  
Moderator: Great. Yeah, so, please go ahead and click Learn More.  
91  
00:10:12.530 \--\> 00:10:16.829  
Moderator: Is this where you were expecting to go when you clicked on the link?  
92  
00:10:18.170 \--\> 00:10:22.809  
P11: I don't remember. I think it was more of a…  
93  
00:10:22.940 \--\> 00:10:27.589  
P11: when I did the problem, it just, like, was a button I could click on the USA jobs, so…  
94  
00:10:30.990 \--\> 00:10:34.920  
P11: Well, the OPM, I think, was… Looks fine.  
95  
00:10:35.580 \--\> 00:10:36.220  
Moderator: Good.  
96  
00:10:44.850 \--\> 00:10:52.680  
Moderator: So, could you please navigate back to the page that we were just on, and we'll look at another one.  
97  
00:10:53.490 \--\> 00:10:58.659  
Moderator: Okay, so I'd like you to find one that you have never engaged with before.  
98  
00:11:05.490 \--\> 00:11:07.469  
P11: Success on campus.  
99  
00:11:07.470 \--\> 00:11:11.710  
Moderator: Okay, great. So, if you could please click through on this one.  
100  
00:11:18.300 \--\> 00:11:23.049

102  
00:11:28.060 \--\> 00:11:33.899  
P11: So, as a service member, so a dependent, if you're eligible for FRI, survivors…  
103  
00:11:34.110 \--\> 00:11:38.380  
P11: GI transfers are eligible for the NAGI program.  
104  
00:11:40.700 \--\> 00:11:42.409  
P11: Well, it's straightforward.  
105  
00:11:44.200 \--\> 00:11:55.530  
Moderator: Were you expecting to get to a page like this that's describing the benefit, or would you expect to go to a page that had… that takes you straight to the application?  
106  
00:11:56.630 \--\> 00:11:57.460  
P11: Hmm…  
107  
00:11:58.310 \--\> 00:12:13.910  
P11: I think I would have said either or. I mean, it's fine that it takes me to a page that tells me when I'm eligible for it, so then I don't have to search for it when I go on the actual,  
108  
00:12:15.980 \--\> 00:12:17.120  
P11: Website?  
109  
00:12:21.440 \--\> 00:12:38.190  
Moderator: If you could please, go back to this, to the, page we were just on. So when you're going back, do you have any sense that you will go back and lose your answers, or do you feel okay clicking through?  
110  
00:12:39.250 \--\> 00:12:40.839  
P11: I'm fine with your flipping through.  
111  
00:12:40.840 \--\> 00:12:41.840  
Moderator: Okay, great.  
112  
00:12:41.960 \--\> 00:12:51.790  
Moderator: So I want to take a look, we looked at the cards, we looked at sorting, like, you've played with both a little bit. I'd like it if.  
113  
00:12:51.790 \--\> 00:12:52.250  
P11: you could…  
114  
00:12:52.250 \--\> 00:12:56.160  
Moderator: Please scroll up, and then take a look at the filters on the left-hand side.  
115  
00:12:57.030 \--\> 00:13:02.010  
Moderator: I noticed that you clicked a couple of them,  
116  
00:13:02.990 \--\> 00:13:11.540  
Moderator: Can you talk through what you're seeing when you look through this filter section, and the things that you think you might be able to do?  
117  
00:13:12.390 \--\> 00:13:19.850  
P11: It looks straightforward, before and after separation, so I'll probably just do after separation, since it doesn't apply to me, or before.  
118  
00:13:20.690 \--\> 00:13:23.509  
P11: And reply, see what happens.  
119  
00:13:30.310 \--\> 00:13:31.680  
P11: Guess something happens.  
120  
00:13:34.230 \--\> 00:13:39.090  
Moderator: Yeah, do you have a theory about why nothing happens when you click that?  
121  
00:13:39.490 \--\> 00:13:53.910  
P11: It's because nothing… when the… I guess the filter that I originally put down first had already said that… I guess because I put in that I separate more than 3 years ago, it just automatically does everything after separation, because I don't qualify for tops anymore.  
122  
00:13:54.110 \--\> 00:14:04.790  
Moderator: Yeah, that's correct. So, I'm wondering, when you look… when you look at the benefits.  
123  
00:14:06.450 \--\> 00:14:14.269  
Moderator: Do you… Do you think… are all the benefits that are available after separation shown here?  
124  
00:14:15.470 \--\> 00:14:16.729  
P11: I think so.  
125  
00:14:17.110 \--\> 00:14:17.610  
Moderator: Yeah.  
126  
00:14:20.010 \--\> 00:14:27.639  
Moderator: If you wanted to see recommended benefits that aren't recommended for you based on your goals, do you see a way on the page to do that?  
127  
00:14:28.770 \--\> 00:14:35.319  
P11: I guess… have I clicked on the force operation, but I don't think it would show me anything.  
128  
00:14:36.430 \--\> 00:14:44.430  
P11: Doesn't look like… Before… I guess it'll just be a GI Bill, and they're in readiness, but…  
129  
00:14:44.800 \--\> 00:14:51.939  
P11: new benefits. Learn more clicking on this one to learn more about the benefits for service members.  
130  
00:14:52.890 \--\> 00:14:57.660  
P11: Or I'll go back and update my answer so I can change it and say, hey, no, I just separated.  
131  
00:14:59.720 \--\> 00:15:01.459  
P11: And change that criteria.  
132  
00:15:16.440 \--\> 00:15:27.590  
Moderator: So, if you go down to the filters section where it says filters and 3, because you have 3 connected, do you see where it says show results, and then it says show only results recommended for you?  
133  
00:15:28.100 \--\> 00:15:33.129  
Moderator: What do you think would happen? First of all, did you see that?  
134  
00:15:34.010 \--\> 00:15:37.260  
P11: I guess I just ignored it.  
135  
00:15:37.720 \--\> 00:15:40.799  
Moderator: Yeah, what do you think would happen if you unchecked that?  
136  
00:15:41.320 \--\> 00:15:48.279  
P11: I guess I would show the ones that were not recommended for me. So, Veterans Readiness and Employment.  
137  
00:15:48.750 \--\> 00:15:50.739  
P11: This is the one that just popped up.  
138  
00:15:53.610 \--\> 00:15:57.339  
P11: Maybe not. I'm sure there's GI benefits.  
139  
00:15:59.250 \--\> 00:16:01.430  
P11: Oh, transfer your GI benefits.  
140  
00:16:01.560 \--\> 00:16:04.829  
P11: This is the new one that showed up before you separate from service.  
141  
00:16:06.250 \--\> 00:16:06.970  
Moderator: Yeah, we…  
142  
00:16:06.970 \--\> 00:16:10.299  
P11: I guess it says recommended for you, and this one doesn't say recommended for you.  
143  
00:16:10.770 \--\> 00:16:17.920  
Moderator: Oh, great, I was just about to ask, Blake if… if it was clear why some of… why the new ones popped up.  
144  
00:16:19.090 \--\> 00:16:22.730  
P11: Yeah, it just says the recommended and not recommended.  
145  
00:16:22.730 \--\> 00:16:30.110  
Moderator: Yeah. So what do you think about the filters? Like, we've got burials and memorials, career, and employment. Do these filters make sense?  
146  
00:16:30.930 \--\> 00:16:31.560  
P11: Yes.  
147  
00:16:31.940 \--\> 00:16:34.609  
Moderator: Yeah, is there anything that's missing?  
148  
00:16:37.460 \--\> 00:16:38.839  
P11: No, I don't think so.  
149  
00:16:43.960 \--\> 00:16:47.310  
P11: Unless you want to say, like, other, but I don't think anything's missing.  
150  
00:17:01.630 \--\> 00:17:11.479  
Moderator: Is there anything else that's jumping out to you on this page? Something, you know, any thoughts about, like, what's working, what isn't working?  
151  
00:17:12.660 \--\> 00:17:18.800  
P11: Oh… What is not working? I mean, it looks okay.  
152  
00:17:20.300 \--\> 00:17:34.439  
Moderator: So, like, backing up a little bit to think about, like, the benefits you've gotten at VA, benefits that might be available for you, are, are you seeing any benefits on this page that you didn't know were available?  
153  
00:17:35.110 \--\> 00:17:37.680  
P11: No, I think I have heard of most of them.  
154  
00:17:38.510 \--\> 00:17:47.280  
Moderator: Cool. Like, I know you said you hadn't used Veteran Success on campus, but it sounds like you'd heard of it, just you hadn't used it?  
155  
00:17:47.680 \--\> 00:17:50.350  
P11: No. I mean, I think I heard about it in TAPS.  
156  
00:17:50.550 \--\> 00:17:56.390  
P11: To go back to college, and it didn't apply to me, so I didn't really… Think about it.  
157  
00:17:56.650 \--\> 00:17:57.260  
Moderator: Yeah.  
158  
00:17:57.820 \--\> 00:18:05.889  
Moderator: Okay, is there anything else you want to share about, like, this page, or, the whole experience?  
159  
00:18:06.620 \--\> 00:18:08.530  
P11: No, it looks pretty straightforward.  
160  
00:18:11.080 \--\> 00:18:17.349  
Moderator: So, a couple of follow-up questions about this.  
161  
00:18:21.700 \--\> 00:18:26.900  
Moderator: is this a helpful tool for you in your life right now?  
162  
00:18:27.820 \--\> 00:18:36.650  
P11: Yeah, I think it would… I think it would have been even more helpful when I first transitioned out of the military, but I think I feel like I've heard most of these things.  
163  
00:18:37.450 \--\> 00:18:41.929  
P11: I guess, what is this, apply for discharge upgrade? I've never heard of that one, but…  
164  
00:18:42.230 \--\> 00:18:48.340  
P11: What does that mean to be a discharge upgrade? I guess you can't do anything more from, like, an honorable discharge.  
165  
00:18:48.520 \--\> 00:18:49.520  
P11: Exactly.  
166  
00:18:49.520 \--\> 00:19:06.440  
Moderator: Exactly, it's not one that… it wasn't recommended for you because you said you had an honorable discharge. So that's not one… people with honorable discharges don't generally hear about it, but then sometimes they're happy to hear about the benefit because they know people who they'd like to share the information with.  
167  
00:19:07.270 \--\> 00:19:17.989  
Moderator: And you anticipated my next question, which is, what would you change about this product to make it more useful for somebody who is transitioning out of the military right now?  
168  
00:19:20.190 \--\> 00:19:22.500  
P11: Like, what would be more useful for them? Sorry.  
169  
00:19:22.500 \--\> 00:19:32.729  
Moderator: Yeah, like, if you think… if you think back to your experience transitioning, what could we do to make this better for a transitioning person?  
170  
00:19:35.100 \--\> 00:19:48.219  
P11: I think it was just having the resources and being able to know where to look. I think when I first got out of the military, no one really knew where to look for information.  
171  
00:19:49.090 \--\> 00:20:01.179  
Moderator: Yeah, I've heard that… I've heard that a lot, that it's… that taps can be an overwhelming amount of information, and it's hard to know what to do to follow up on that. So that's, like, one… that's the reason that we're building this.  
172  
00:20:03.760 \--\> 00:20:12.129  
Moderator: So, like, thinking about the whole experience of using this tool, what would you rank it for 1 to 5? 1's the worst, 5's the best?  
173  
00:20:12.820 \--\> 00:20:20.570  
P11: I think it's, like, a 5, it looks pretty good, it has everything in one area, and then you can click on a button to learn more about it.  
174  
00:20:20.770 \--\> 00:20:33.300  
Moderator: Good\! I'm really glad to hear that, that it's intuitive. Is there anything you can think of to make it easier to… how would you want to make it easier to see what  
175  
00:20:33.820 \--\> 00:20:48.080  
Moderator: the way it's sorted, because I know that was a little confusing to you. Like, you were looking to see, is it sorted by alphabetically? Is it sorted by, by, type of benefit?  
176  
00:20:49.240 \--\> 00:21:04.969  
P11: I think probably just doing either name or type of benefit first, as opposed to expiration, but I guess the expiration didn't apply to me, since I've already been out for so long. And the expiration date first would be more applicable if I was just separating, like, yesterday.  
177  
00:21:06.460 \--\> 00:21:14.200  
Moderator: Got it. What do you think VAs should know about your experience  
178  
00:21:14.510 \--\> 00:21:20.480  
Moderator: Getting benefits after you transitioned that might help us, make this better?  
179  
00:21:21.190 \--\> 00:21:23.260  
P11: Well, I transitioned during COVID, so…  
180  
00:21:23.260 \--\> 00:21:26.639  
Moderator: I don't know. I don't know if anything could have made that better.  
181  
00:21:28.540 \--\> 00:21:30.199  
P11: Everything was very slow.  
182  
00:21:30.200 \--\> 00:21:38.290  
Moderator: Yeah, I've heard a lot of stories about 2020, 2021, people transitioning and having a really bumpy experience.  
183  
00:21:38.570 \--\> 00:21:50.409  
P11: Yeah, it was… it was difficult, I think. It was just… everything was slow, not… there wasn't a lot of resources out there, and I guess, I mean, the world shut down, ideal, so… I think anything will be an improvement.  
184  
00:21:52.580 \--\> 00:21:59.229  
Moderator: Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry you had to deal with that. It's… it's… it sounds like it was pretty chaotic.  
185  
00:22:00.770 \--\> 00:22:05.190  
P11: Well, I'm glad I was able to get out, because I know people who weren't even able to get out.  
186  
00:22:05.190 \--\> 00:22:06.139  
Moderator: Oh, wow.  
187  
00:22:08.390 \--\> 00:22:14.619  
Moderator: Okay, so that's all of our questions, that's the whole interview.  
188  
00:22:14.840 \--\> 00:22:18.940  
Moderator: I,  
189  
00:22:20.990 \--\> 00:22:37.720  
Moderator: I'm just taking… I'm taking a look to make sure in my checklist. Yep, that's… that's it. I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback has been incredibly helpful, and thank you for the insights you've provided.  
190  
00:22:38.000 \--\> 00:22:49.679  
Moderator: Perugian is going to be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans you may know to provide them a chance to participate in future studies. And yeah, enjoy the rest of your day. Thanks again.  
191  
00:22:50.110 \--\> 00:22:53.860  
P11: Well, thank you for, developing this website. I'm sure it'll be helpful in the future.  
192  
00:22:54.120 \--\> 00:22:56.070  
Moderator: Thanks, it's great to hear that.  
193  
00:22:57.180 \--\> 00:22:59.969  
P11: Trying to stop my screen sharing…  
194  
00:23:01.060 \--\> 00:23:03.669  
P11: Sure, sure. Is there anything else I need to do?  
195  
00:23:03.750 \--\> 00:23:04.980  
Moderator: Nope, that's it.  
196  
00:23:05.650 \--\> 00:23:09.310  
Moderator: You're good. Yeah, you too, thank you. Bye.
