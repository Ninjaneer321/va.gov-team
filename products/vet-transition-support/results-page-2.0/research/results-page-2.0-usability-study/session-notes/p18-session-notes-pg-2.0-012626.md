| Role | Veteran |
| Gen | Woman |
| Ethnicity | Black or African American; White or Caucasian |
| Age | 27 |
| Education | Master's degree |
| Branch | Navy |
| Location | OR / Urban |
| Separation | Last 10 years |
| Guard and reserve | N/A |
| Honorable discharge | Yes |
| Years served | 1-4 years |
| Cognitive disability | Yes |
| Assistive tech | N/A |
| Comfort with technology | Very |
| About device and accessibility tech | Windows, Edge |
| What services they use on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) | use it for refilling medications. Uses MHEV. Uses it to speak with providers. Previously used it to look up Edu benefits, but no longer needs to do that. Uses it 2-3x per month |
| Complete questionnaire easily | Yes |
| Questionnaire observations | easily goes through questionnaire. (Only Qs were about goals, but that was more about whether it should be hypothetical or not) Goes through each accordion menu individually (clicking each) to confirm her choices. Clicks through privacy policy (usually would skim it IRL) based on Qs: wouldn't have expected to see disability comp (especially seeing it first), since she's already receiving and said so on quesitonnaire. Didn't expect Edu benefits, since she didn't select college, but thinks it could be connecte do career. Didn't expect to see foreign med benefits based on her selection. |
| Finding sort | Yes |
| Notes on finding sort | She said she found sort on her own but didn't use it. (Doesn't seem like she noticed the sort options at the top. Says she did notice it, but didn't know what it (expiration date) meant) |
| Use sort as expected? | Yes with help |
| Notes on using sort | She's not sure why the benefits are sorted the way they are. Would like it to feel more relevant to what she answered (e.g. shouldn't show disability first--or maybe at all) Not sure why disability comp is listsed as soonest expiring, since it doesn't really expire. Would like to see "Type of benefit" as default sort |
| Finding filters | Yes |
| Notes on finding filters | She says she saw them, but didn't click on them. |
| Use filters as expected? | Yes |
| Notes on using filters | Clicked "all", but she still would expect to see things be tailored to answers since the top info says "based on your answers" Would maybe prefer "all benefits" instead of "all results", since she feels like results would be tailored by her answers, where as "all benefits" would be for anyone and show everything. |
| Exploring and understanding recommended vs all | Yes with help |
| Notes on recommended vs all | To see all/more benefits, she thinks she would "click all results) and then click around on beneft type. Didn't click on her own, but says she did notice them. |
| Exploring and understanding when to apply filter | Yes |
| Notes on when to apply filter | clicked this on her own and imediately did "After separation" since that is what her situation is |
| Found benefit information easily | Yes |
| Notes on finding benefit information | likes that it says "when to apply", but confused as to why some "before separation", since she didn't select that. She sees that they say "before or after", but just doesn't seem to really like that it says both. For ex: she's not sure about how one would apply for something like VA mental health services BEFORE one separates. Curious about why some benefits are recommended to her (e.g. foreign md benefits). But is guessing "learn more" might have have more info about why it's applicable (feels so niche, that it's not expected--especially as a top recommended one. but understands if tool is recommending all benefits, then it would be fine that it's there). Info on cards "seems good." But wonders if ECC would show up under "education" tag, since it's under "careers and employment." (meta-insight: there can be category overlaps for benefits) wonders what "more support" means--not clear to her without clicking on it (after click: "feels like miscellaneous" category) Is glad that Discharge Upgrade is on here and is happy to see that it can be done digitally now. |
| Is this tool helpful for you in your life today? | Yes |
| Notes on helpful in life today | Can see it being useful down the line, and wishes it existed when she got out. She used a lot of her benefits already earlier on, but is thinking about later life steps (home loan, burial, etc.) (didn't give star rating) |
| Satisfaction 1-5 | 4 |
| Notes on satisfaction | answer depends on what "learn more" leads to. (clicked on state benefits and discharge upgrade, and is happy with where those lead). Site is "pretty handy". 4 now, but could be a 5 with some tweaks, like better sorting, better understanding of expiration, etc. (issues she already brought up) |
| What would you change about this tool to help someone transitioning from Active Duty? |  |
| What do you think VA should know about your experience getting benefits after transitioning? | likes that this tool is available as an un-auth-ed experience for people without an account yet. |
| Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared? | No |
| Recording consent | Yes |
| Consent to share clips | Yes |

P18: Yes.  
3  
00:00:13.480 \--\> 00:00:22.259  
Moderator: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that could be used to identify you?  
4  
00:00:22.650 \--\> 00:00:23.240  
P18: Yes.  
5

Moderator: So first, could you tell me a little bit about how you use VA.gov, the mobile app, or, you know, how you interact with the VA Digital Services?  
7  
00:00:42.420 \--\> 00:00:46.470

8  
00:00:46.590 \--\> 00:00:55.840  
P18: Is My HealthyVet, which now redirects to VA.gov, so I'm guessing it's now a VA.gov site.  
9  
00:00:56.220 \--\> 00:00:58.359  
P18: And I…  
10  
00:00:58.680 \--\> 00:01:06.670  
P18: use it to speak with my providers. I used to use it to look at my education benefits, but I'm no longer using those.  
11  
00:01:08.320 \--\> 00:01:09.620  
Moderator: Great, how…  
12  
00:01:09.620 \--\> 00:01:12.119

13  
00:01:12.490 \--\> 00:01:17.019

14  
00:01:19.030 \--\> 00:01:20.959  
P18: Probably 2-3 times a month.  
15  
00:01:21.340 \--\> 00:01:28.220  
Moderator: Gotcha. Okay, thanks. That's some really helpful context for, what we are going to discuss.  
16  
00:01:28.380 \--\> 00:01:35.950  
Moderator: So to get started looking, I have a prototype link for you.  
17  
00:01:36.430 \--\> 00:01:38.470  
Moderator: That…  
18  
00:01:38.670 \--\> 00:01:45.500  
Moderator: I'm going to drop into the chat, and then if you could please check… or if you could please click it, and then…  
19  
00:01:46.330 \--\> 00:01:49.440  
Moderator: Share your screen.  
20  
00:01:55.460 \--\> 00:01:56.599  
Moderator: Are you seeing it?  
21  
00:01:57.390 \--\> 00:01:58.100  
P18: Yes.  
22  
00:01:58.100 \--\> 00:01:58.730  
Moderator: Sweet.  
23  
00:01:59.420 \--\> 00:02:00.920  
P18: I'm getting there.  
24  
00:02:04.580 \--\> 00:02:05.650  
P18: Come, pop, up.  
25  
00:02:12.480 \--\> 00:02:14.079  
P18: And it's loading.  
26  
00:02:14.270 \--\> 00:02:15.140  
Moderator: Okay.  
27  
00:02:16.930 \--\> 00:02:24.469  
Moderator: So it's, when it loads, it's gonna show, there's gonna be a green button that says continue. You can go ahead and click that.  
28  
00:02:28.580 \--\> 00:02:30.359  
P18: the Get Started button.  
29  
00:02:30.580 \--\> 00:02:36.449  
Moderator: Oh, actually, sounds like you are already at the first page of the prototype. Could you share your screen, please?  
30  
00:02:42.350 \--\> 00:02:43.150  
P18: No.  
31  
00:02:46.520 \--\> 00:02:50.490  
P18: In just a moment, I promise I remember how to do this.  
32  
00:02:51.700 \--\> 00:02:55.279  
Moderator: Let me know if you want… if you want guidance.  
33  
00:02:55.870 \--\> 00:02:59.470  
P18: I just keep accidentally clicking the wrong things, that's all.  
34  
00:03:00.670 \--\> 00:03:02.320  
Moderator: Yeah, Zoom doesn't make it easy.  
35  
00:03:02.320 \--\> 00:03:02.940  
P18: No.  
36  
00:03:03.420 \--\> 00:03:04.230  
P18: No.  
37  
00:03:04.340 \--\> 00:03:07.200  
P18: There we go.  
38  
00:03:09.810 \--\> 00:03:11.410  
P18: Okay…  
39  
00:03:15.300 \--\> 00:03:17.670  
P18: Yes, we got it.  
40  
00:03:19.640 \--\> 00:03:20.520  
Moderator: There you go.  
41  
00:03:21.830 \--\> 00:03:23.260  
Moderator: Awesome\! Okay.  
42  
00:03:23.630 \--\> 00:03:27.980  
Moderator: So what I'd like you to do for,  
43  
00:03:28.150 \--\> 00:03:30.489  
Moderator: This part of the session is…  
44  
00:03:30.630 \--\> 00:03:39.450  
Moderator: This is a tool for helping veterans find benefits that they may be eligible for. I'd like you to go through the process.  
45  
00:03:39.610 \--\> 00:03:55.939  
Moderator: Just like you would if you're doing this on your own. The only difference, I'd like you to say out loud, you know, what you're thinking, feeling, noticing, if something feels weird, if you really like something. Kind of talk your way through it while you're going, and I might stop you for…  
46  
00:03:56.110 \--\> 00:03:59.449  
Moderator: I might stop you for questions,  
47  
00:03:59.700 \--\> 00:04:01.950  
Moderator: And feel free to ask me questions as well.  
48  
00:04:02.320 \--\> 00:04:02.860  
P18: Okay.  
49  
00:04:06.170 \--\> 00:04:07.429  
P18: Do I get started?  
50  
00:04:07.430 \--\> 00:04:08.040  
Moderator: Yep.  
51  
00:04:08.230 \--\> 00:04:08.800  
P18: Okay.  
52  
00:04:14.170 \--\> 00:04:15.030  
P18: Okay.  
53  
00:04:21.890 \--\> 00:04:23.500  
P18: What are my goals?  
54  
00:04:28.770 \--\> 00:04:30.779  
P18: Is it still… yeah, okay.  
55  
00:04:32.620 \--\> 00:04:36.859  
P18: So, here I've got the Discover Your Benefits page.  
56  
00:04:37.220 \--\> 00:04:39.320  
P18: To one of six goals.  
57  
00:04:41.340 \--\> 00:04:42.550  
P18: what should I click?  
58  
00:04:43.160 \--\> 00:04:49.560  
Moderator: Are… are… so there's two options. You can click the one that you're most interested in. If…  
59  
00:04:49.820 \--\> 00:04:53.700  
Moderator: Any of these are benefits you might want to explore for yourself.  
60  
00:04:53.850 \--\> 00:05:10.289  
Moderator: Or you could do it, you know, thinking, like, thinking back to when you were transitioning out of the military into civilian life. It's up to you. But if there's a type of benefit that you're interested in learning more about, that's what I would suggest.  
61  
00:05:10.920 \--\> 00:05:21.349  
P18: Okay, now, alright. Financial support, go back to school, plan for my transition, start a new career, take care of my health and well-being.  
62  
00:05:21.770 \--\> 00:05:23.280  
P18: And just choose one of them.  
63  
00:05:25.870 \--\> 00:05:29.870  
Moderator: any… Any you would like, as many as you would like.  
64  
00:05:30.110 \--\> 00:05:30.800  
P18: Okay.  
65  
00:05:31.500 \--\> 00:05:36.660  
P18: Let's say, start a new career, and… Take care of my health.  
66  
00:05:40.580 \--\> 00:05:43.020  
P18: How long did I serve in the military?  
67  
00:05:43.250 \--\> 00:05:45.309  
P18: 3 to 10 years.  
68  
00:05:49.630 \--\> 00:05:51.060  
P18: I was Navy.  
69  
00:05:53.540 \--\> 00:05:54.990  
P18: Active duty.  
70  
00:05:56.490 \--\> 00:05:58.740  
P18: I am not serving any longer.  
71  
00:06:00.070 \--\> 00:06:03.109  
P18: How long ago? It was over 3 years.  
72  
00:06:09.830 \--\> 00:06:12.510  
P18: Highest character of discharge.  
73  
00:06:13.820 \--\> 00:06:15.010  
P18: Honorable.  
74  
00:06:27.120 \--\> 00:06:29.909  
P18: Do you have a disability rating? Yes, I do.  
75  
00:06:31.450 \--\> 00:06:33.529  
P18: If I had all done, received a rating.  
76  
00:06:39.930 \--\> 00:06:43.860  
P18: Looks like this is just confirming what I chose, yes.  
77  
00:06:46.360 \--\> 00:06:47.330  
P18: Yes.  
78  
00:06:50.440 \--\> 00:06:51.410  
P18: Yes.  
79  
00:06:53.080 \--\> 00:06:54.040  
P18: Yes.  
80  
00:06:56.370 \--\> 00:06:58.960  
P18: Do you guys want me to read the privacy policy?  
81  
00:06:58.960 \--\> 00:07:00.270  
Moderator: Would you, usually?  
82  
00:07:01.480 \--\> 00:07:03.640  
P18: Usually, I would skim it.  
83  
00:07:03.640 \--\> 00:07:05.690  
Moderator: Okay, go ahead and click.  
84  
00:07:09.710 \--\> 00:07:12.579  
Moderator: And it's not going to open correctly, because it's a prototype.  
85  
00:07:12.960 \--\> 00:07:13.580  
P18: Okay.  
86  
00:07:14.730 \--\> 00:07:16.610  
P18: then I will say that I read it.  
87  
00:07:20.150 \--\> 00:07:21.550  
P18: Oh, okay.  
88  
00:07:25.630 \--\> 00:07:29.210  
Moderator: But based on those questions, what were you expecting to see on this page?  
89  
00:07:33.900 \--\> 00:07:45.060  
P18: I was… expecting to… Let's see, not the disability compensation bit,  
90  
00:07:45.980 \--\> 00:07:48.340  
P18: Since I already indicated that I have…  
91  
00:07:48.480 \--\> 00:07:52.709  
P18: that I am receiving disability compensation, that wouldn't have been my…  
92  
00:07:53.950 \--\> 00:07:57.220  
P18: Top expectation to see up there.  
93  
00:07:57.750 \--\> 00:08:08.950  
P18: State veterans benefits, mental health VRE, that makes sense.  
94  
00:08:11.090 \--\> 00:08:14.589  
P18: That success on campus.  
95  
00:08:15.190 \--\> 00:08:20.699  
P18: I guess… That makes sense, even though I didn't indicate college.  
96  
00:08:21.620 \--\> 00:08:24.210  
P18: Since I said a career change.  
97  
00:08:25.220 \--\> 00:08:27.140  
P18: Maybe it makes sense that it's on there?  
98  
00:08:28.100 \--\> 00:08:29.160  
P18: Yeah.  
99  
00:08:31.010 \--\> 00:08:37.740  
P18: foreign medical plan program, I would not have expected to see that on there. That does not seem…  
100  
00:08:38.110 \--\> 00:08:40.200  
P18: Relevant to what I indicated.  
101  
00:08:41.169 \--\> 00:08:46.920  
P18: Oh, maybe… this does, if I'm planning on starting a business.  
102  
00:08:49.840 \--\> 00:08:52.140  
P18: Yay, healthcare, that makes sense.  
103  
00:08:52.300 \--\> 00:08:57.139  
P18: I will say that I like that it shows when to apply.  
104  
00:08:57.980 \--\> 00:09:05.240  
P18: But again, Some of them indicate that they're before I come out of service.  
105  
00:09:05.630 \--\> 00:09:07.509  
Moderator: Which I did not indicate.  
106  
00:09:10.480 \--\> 00:09:13.759  
P18: Veteran's preference, that makes sense.  
107  
00:09:13.760 \--\> 00:09:20.080  
Moderator: Would you… could you show me which one said you should apply before you separate?  
108  
00:09:20.440 \--\> 00:09:23.450  
P18: They all say before… or after.  
109  
00:09:24.070 \--\> 00:09:28.380  
P18: But… So… they apply.  
110  
00:09:28.380 \--\> 00:09:29.270  
Moderator: to me.  
111  
00:09:29.370 \--\> 00:09:30.190  
P18: But…  
112  
00:09:32.370 \--\> 00:09:35.050  
Moderator: Okay, so, got it. So,  
113  
00:09:35.420 \--\> 00:09:38.749  
Moderator: Is it clear that that means you can apply anytime?  
114  
00:09:41.010 \--\> 00:09:42.000  
P18: Yes.  
115  
00:09:42.000 \--\> 00:09:43.389  
Moderator: Yes, but…  
116  
00:09:43.390 \--\> 00:09:44.550  
P18: Yes.  
117  
00:09:44.800 \--\> 00:09:47.129  
P18: Yes.  
118  
00:09:57.630 \--\> 00:09:58.650  
Moderator: How would you say…  
119  
00:09:58.650 \--\> 00:10:02.080  
P18: So, like, the VA Mental Health Services,  
120  
00:10:02.960 \--\> 00:10:11.290  
P18: I don't know how one does… How one would… And enroll in services with… the VA before…  
121  
00:10:12.080 \--\> 00:10:15.130  
P18: separation, but… But…  
122  
00:10:15.270 \--\> 00:10:20.689  
P18: does not apply to me, or what I was checking, so I guess that's more of just a side curiosity.  
123  
00:10:21.310 \--\> 00:10:29.070  
Moderator: Yeah, you know, just as an aside, that exists, and I think not enough people know about it.  
124  
00:10:29.070 \--\> 00:10:29.970  
P18: Wow.  
125  
00:10:29.970 \--\> 00:10:36.390  
Moderator: Yeah, it's a benefit for people in their last year of service as they transition.  
126  
00:10:36.710 \--\> 00:10:40.220  
P18: Wow. How long has that been around? Has that always been around?  
127  
00:10:40.220 \--\> 00:10:46.309  
Moderator: No, it has not always existed. I think it is relatively new, but I don't have the full context on that.  
128  
00:10:46.530 \--\> 00:10:47.879  
P18: That makes sense, then.  
129  
00:10:48.910 \--\> 00:10:51.780  
P18: Well, that's exciting for newer veterans.  
130  
00:10:54.370 \--\> 00:10:59.429  
Moderator: So, like, looking… so looking at the card that has a benefit on it,  
131  
00:11:02.700 \--\> 00:11:08.710  
Moderator: What information… is there any information that you're not seeing that would help you understand the benefit?  
132  
00:11:09.960 \--\> 00:11:11.060  
P18: I don't know.  
133  
00:11:11.230 \--\> 00:11:14.410  
P18: It's got the little blurbs.  
134  
00:11:18.150 \--\> 00:11:27.279  
P18: Some of them, I'm curious why they're recommended for me. Like the foreign one, why is that one being recommended to me? The foreign medical program?  
135  
00:11:29.790 \--\> 00:11:30.580  
Moderator: But…  
136  
00:11:30.790 \--\> 00:11:35.450  
P18: I see that I can click learn more on the… Cards.  
137  
00:11:37.090 \--\> 00:11:42.419  
P18: I'm guessing it might have a little bit more information about why they think it's applicable to my situation.  
138  
00:11:42.780 \--\> 00:11:49.970  
Moderator: So, let's talk through this part of it, that…  
139  
00:11:50.330 \--\> 00:11:58.510  
Moderator: you wouldn't know this if you were doing this on your own, but I know that it's showing it to you because you selected Take Care My Health and Wellbeing as a goal.  
140  
00:11:58.800 \--\> 00:12:18.600  
Moderator: And it's… it's a healthcare benefit, so the way it's working is it… is it… is it's recommend… it's recommending all benefits that are available after separation or any time to you that are health… healthcare related. But it's… it sounds like that's a surprise.  
141  
00:12:19.180 \--\> 00:12:29.350  
P18: Yes, yes. I see here that it's in the healthcare category, but, yeah, it's just…  
142  
00:12:29.480 \--\> 00:12:40.520  
P18: not… it's such a niche little program, it's not what I would have expected to put on there, but… or to have seen as one of the top recommended ones.  
143  
00:12:41.260 \--\> 00:12:41.770  
P18: Huh.  
144  
00:12:42.700 \--\> 00:12:43.240  
Moderator: Yeah, so…  
145  
00:12:43.240 \--\> 00:12:49.930  
P18: qualm against having it there, it makes sense if it's… if they're just recommending all of the healthcare-related programs.  
146  
00:12:50.840 \--\> 00:12:59.539  
Moderator: If you scroll up a little bit, I am really curious to know your theory about why the benefits are in the order that they are in.  
147  
00:13:02.070 \--\> 00:13:07.869  
P18: That, I have no idea. No idea. Again, I was expen… ex…  
148  
00:13:08.720 \--\> 00:13:18.309  
P18: I was not expecting to see the disability compensation. The disability category as the top one, the top recommended.  
149  
00:13:18.420 \--\> 00:13:26.849  
P18: Because I already indicated that I'm receiving, I have a rating, and that wasn't something that I clicked on.  
150  
00:13:27.130 \--\> 00:13:29.270  
P18: the disability benefits.  
151  
00:13:31.880 \--\> 00:13:32.630  
Moderator: Yeah, so…  
152  
00:13:32.630 \--\> 00:13:34.569  
P18: fall under health.  
153  
00:13:35.440 \--\> 00:13:41.179  
Moderator: So, it sounds like it would feel more personalized if it didn't show disability.  
154  
00:13:41.870 \--\> 00:13:49.809  
P18: Yeah, or even if I had disability at the bottom, and it had ones that were relevant to what I had clicked on.  
155  
00:13:49.810 \--\> 00:13:50.790  
Moderator: Mmm.  
156  
00:13:51.740 \--\> 00:13:58.940  
Moderator: So if you scroll up a little bit, there's, there's a box that says your results, and then sort, expiration date.  
157  
00:13:59.100 \--\> 00:14:00.689  
Moderator: Did you see that?  
158  
00:14:03.170 \--\> 00:14:07.829  
P18: I did, but I wasn't sure why… what the expiration date is.  
159  
00:14:08.780 \--\> 00:14:16.030  
P18: Because I really could apply for disability compensation Anytime post.  
160  
00:14:16.440 \--\> 00:14:17.460  
P18: nervous.  
161  
00:14:18.370 \--\> 00:14:23.400  
P18: So I'm not sure why it's… Listed as the soonest expiring.  
162  
00:14:23.750 \--\> 00:14:43.580  
Moderator: Yeah, we're considering… the reason that that is there is that a lot of people who use this tool, we're going to be piloting it in taps for people who are transitioning out of the military now, and there are several benefits in the last year of service, first year and a half of post-separation, where  
163  
00:14:43.580 \--\> 00:14:49.930  
Moderator: there is… a deadline. And so, expiration date, you know, one of… one of those  
164  
00:14:49.930 \--\> 00:14:59.040  
Moderator: one of those folks knows exactly what that means. For veterans who have been out for 3 plus years like you, the language, you know, we've…  
165  
00:14:59.230 \--\> 00:15:08.530  
Moderator: We've done a… they're actually our last tester for this round, and veterans who've been out for a while.  
166  
00:15:08.820 \--\> 00:15:09.410  
P18: Okay.  
167  
00:15:09.410 \--\> 00:15:28.050  
Moderator: don't know why expiration date is on the page, because disability doesn't expire, GI doesn't… bill doesn't expire unless you… yeah, unless you, separated before 2013, etc. So, expiration date is not a really important concept for most benefits.  
168  
00:15:28.050 \--\> 00:15:28.640  
P18: Excuse me.  
169  
00:15:28.810 \--\> 00:15:37.140  
Moderator: Yeah. So, that's a really important insight. As for… if you click on sort, and you look at…  
170  
00:15:37.660 \--\> 00:15:43.849  
Moderator: The other ways to sort. So, name and type of benefit.  
171  
00:15:44.150 \--\> 00:15:55.210  
Moderator: What would you like to see the default sort be for this page? If we were going to get rid of expiration date as the default.  
172  
00:15:55.480 \--\> 00:16:03.240  
P18: So my options would be name or type of benefit for the new default? I would say type of benefit.  
173  
00:16:04.120 \--\> 00:16:09.419  
Moderator: All the healthcare, and then all the education, and then all the career. Gotcha.  
174  
00:16:09.890 \--\> 00:16:10.950  
Moderator: Yes.  
175  
00:16:13.790 \--\> 00:16:19.380  
Moderator: so, when you're looking,  
176  
00:16:19.910 \--\> 00:16:29.169  
Moderator: When you're looking at individual benefits, there is a way to… To see…  
177  
00:16:29.890 \--\> 00:16:40.570  
Moderator: the ones that are displayed for you, have the recommended for you tag. Do you think… does it feel like you're seeing all the benefits?  
178  
00:16:41.580 \--\> 00:16:42.260  
P18: No.  
179  
00:16:42.500 \--\> 00:16:48.300  
Moderator: Do you see a way on the page to make it so that you could see all the benefits if you wanted to?  
180  
00:16:49.180 \--\> 00:16:51.800  
P18: If I wanted to, I think I would click.  
181  
00:16:51.940 \--\> 00:16:59.020  
P18: All results, and then maybe add in the… Benefits?  
182  
00:17:02.650 \--\> 00:17:03.979  
Moderator: Yeah, got you.  
183  
00:17:03.980 \--\> 00:17:04.569  
P18: wall.  
184  
00:17:05.859 \--\> 00:17:11.579  
Moderator: What… did… did you notice the ability to do that, like, when you got onto the page?  
185  
00:17:12.609 \--\> 00:17:13.389  
P18: Yes.  
186  
00:17:13.390 \--\> 00:17:17.880  
Moderator: You notice it right away. Did you see the filters right away?  
187  
00:17:18.200 \--\> 00:17:18.900  
P18: Yes.  
188  
00:17:19.099 \--\> 00:17:20.989  
Moderator: Gotcha.  
189  
00:17:21.429 \--\> 00:17:33.459  
Moderator: I would love it if you could, play with the filters, apply and unapply anything you want to. I just want to see you, interact and look at some of the different options.  
190  
00:17:33.810 \--\> 00:17:34.450  
P18: Okay.  
191  
00:17:35.440 \--\> 00:17:36.749  
P18: So I'd be curious.  
192  
00:17:37.010 \--\> 00:17:41.600  
P18: All results and see… Without changing anything else.  
193  
00:17:42.160 \--\> 00:17:44.170  
P18: I would expect to see ones that  
194  
00:17:45.650 \--\> 00:17:51.800  
P18: Still apply to me based on the, information that I put in.  
195  
00:17:53.110 \--\> 00:18:01.570  
P18: So I see… taps… okay, now it's just showing me everything. I see. Not just what's… applicable.  
196  
00:18:04.630 \--\> 00:18:11.859  
P18: So, let's see… I would go and… Click After Separation.  
197  
00:18:14.990 \--\> 00:18:15.780  
P18: Okay.  
198  
00:18:16.410 \--\> 00:18:17.819  
P18: And a lot of these.  
199  
00:18:19.480 \--\> 00:18:20.450  
P18: are not.  
200  
00:18:20.780 \--\> 00:18:26.950  
P18: applicable at all. I would have expected that even if I clicked all results, it would show me ones that  
201  
00:18:28.320 \--\> 00:18:31.509  
P18: relate to what I had clicked, since I can  
202  
00:18:32.790 \--\> 00:18:35.670  
P18: Since it still says, based on your answers.  
203  
00:18:35.860 \--\> 00:18:39.329  
P18: I would still expect this page to have ones that  
204  
00:18:40.010 \--\> 00:18:43.020  
P18: are applicable to what information I put in.  
205  
00:18:43.700 \--\> 00:18:44.580  
Moderator: Got it.  
206  
00:18:44.770 \--\> 00:18:46.079  
P18: If that makes sense.  
207  
00:18:46.870 \--\> 00:18:47.680  
P18: Okay.  
208  
00:18:48.620 \--\> 00:18:49.570  
Moderator: So…  
209  
00:18:49.690 \--\> 00:19:00.509  
Moderator: What could we change about, like, the button that says recommended for you in all results? What could we change there to make it clear that  
210  
00:19:00.510 \--\> 00:19:16.150  
Moderator: when you… when you… because what's happening is when you click recommended for you, you see the benefits that are just… that are recommended for you, based on the questions you asked, and then if you click all results, that is every single benefit. Is there a way we could communicate that better?  
211  
00:19:24.070 \--\> 00:19:29.029  
P18: Maybe instead of all results, maybe all benefits?  
212  
00:19:29.530 \--\> 00:19:30.045  
Moderator: Hmm…  
213  
00:19:31.510 \--\> 00:19:39.500  
P18: because when it, again, when it says results, I expect that to mean the results based on the information that I input.  
214  
00:19:40.050 \--\> 00:19:47.640  
P18: But if it just says all benefits, then I would expect to be able to see everything that's applicable to everyone.  
215  
00:19:50.880 \--\> 00:19:52.540  
Moderator: Oh, that's a really good insight.  
216  
00:20:01.440 \--\> 00:20:15.079  
Moderator: Okay, so now that you've… you've clicked through some of the filters and explored, I have some questions about the benefits themselves. So, when you're looking at the carts, and like, let's just say the first one up here, careers and Employment, education and career counseling.  
217  
00:20:15.090 \--\> 00:20:22.540  
Moderator: Looking at that benefit, do you feel like the information on there is complete?  
218  
00:20:23.270 \--\> 00:20:29.809  
P18: You can apply for free educational and career guidance planning resources through the Personalized Career Planning and Guidance Program.  
219  
00:20:30.080 \--\> 00:20:32.350  
P18: Your dependents might also be eligible.  
220  
00:20:33.320 \--\> 00:20:34.000  
P18: Apply it.  
221  
00:20:40.680 \--\> 00:20:53.810  
P18: Seems… good, the… I don't know. The only thing that…  
222  
00:20:55.370 \--\> 00:21:00.150  
P18: I guess if it's only under the careers and Employment tab.  
223  
00:21:00.880 \--\> 00:21:06.759  
P18: something that I wonder is if it would still pop up if I was only looking… if I was looking under educational.  
224  
00:21:07.350 \--\> 00:21:08.180  
Moderator: Mmm.  
225  
00:21:08.730 \--\> 00:21:11.290  
P18: But… That's…  
226  
00:21:11.520 \--\> 00:21:17.399  
P18: That doesn't mean that the information is incomplete. I think that it's got enough information that it would…  
227  
00:21:17.690 \--\> 00:21:22.190  
P18: answer my… What is this general question?  
228  
00:21:24.000 \--\> 00:21:30.489  
Moderator: Got you. So, yeah, it does…  
229  
00:21:31.120 \--\> 00:21:52.540  
Moderator: I can see how, like, having it… having one category and not having things that are both in education and encouraged employment, that's a little… that could be a little confusing if you're sorting by type of benefit, and if you are looking specifically, at every possible benefit in  
230  
00:21:52.590 \--\> 00:21:56.229  
Moderator: in that… in that realm. So, yeah, that's a great insight.  
231  
00:22:01.990 \--\> 00:22:03.049  
P18: That's all I got.  
232  
00:22:03.050 \--\> 00:22:12.929  
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, this is great. I have a couple of follow-up questions for you, first is…  
233  
00:22:13.180 \--\> 00:22:15.789  
Moderator: Is this something that's helpful for you right now?  
234  
00:22:17.150 \--\> 00:22:21.849  
Moderator: And thinking about what benefits you might want, benefits that you're not currently getting.  
235  
00:22:23.160 \--\> 00:22:29.240  
P18: I can see it being… Useful for me, more…  
236  
00:22:29.550 \--\> 00:22:36.760  
P18: down the line, I wish this tool existed when I had gotten out, when I went through TAPS. It's…  
237  
00:22:37.220 \--\> 00:22:45.209  
P18: So handy, and it's way better than having the 8,000 little pamphlets and flyers that we ended up with.  
238  
00:22:45.630 \--\> 00:22:56.459  
P18: And… if I were ever interested in… the, burials and memorials, or in…  
239  
00:22:57.030 \--\> 00:23:01.450  
P18: a career change, it could be useful. I used up  
240  
00:23:02.170 \--\> 00:23:16.159  
P18: many of my benefits already, like the Voc Rehab I used, and the education I used. If I ever wanted to buy a house, I would look here to see if it showed the veterans,  
241  
00:23:16.370 \--\> 00:23:18.830  
P18: loan… program.  
242  
00:23:18.930 \--\> 00:23:20.550  
P18: Can't remember what it's called.  
243  
00:23:20.630 \--\> 00:23:22.350  
Moderator: But… Yeah, hello?  
244  
00:23:22.350 \--\> 00:23:23.660  
P18: Yeah, yeah.  
245  
00:23:23.800 \--\> 00:23:24.310  
Moderator: Yeah.  
246  
00:23:24.310 \--\> 00:23:25.140  
P18: So…  
247  
00:23:25.140 \--\> 00:23:38.800  
Moderator: like, you might… you might return to it in a different life phase when things change, and you want to see what's… what's here for me now that… now that this thing has changed, and I'm ready for… ready to buy a house, or would like to look into burial and memorial. Gotcha.  
248  
00:23:38.820 \--\> 00:23:47.149  
Moderator: What could we change about this to make it better, either for you or for people who are transitioning right now?  
249  
00:23:49.930 \--\> 00:23:51.190  
P18: Oh, goodness.  
250  
00:24:05.540 \--\> 00:24:08.380  
P18: I am curious about the… the more support.  
251  
00:24:09.220 \--\> 00:24:10.030  
P18: Right.  
252  
00:24:10.490 \--\> 00:24:11.050  
Moderator: Mmm.  
253  
00:24:11.050 \--\> 00:24:16.409  
P18: What does that… what does that mean, specifically? Like, it just seems a little…  
254  
00:24:17.530 \--\> 00:24:22.139  
P18: I don't know, like, is it the miscellaneous category?  
255  
00:24:22.140 \--\> 00:24:24.589  
Moderator: Oh, why don't you click it and see what happens?  
256  
00:24:24.780 \--\> 00:24:30.219  
P18: Wait, alright… All results after separation.  
257  
00:24:30.520 \--\> 00:24:38.880  
P18: Okay, so state benefits or a discharge upgrade. Okay, so yeah, it does seem like it's very miscellaneous,  
258  
00:24:39.230 \--\> 00:24:44.240  
P18: Because those are two very, very different… categories, things.  
259  
00:24:49.530 \--\> 00:24:53.920  
P18: The discharge upgrade, I wouldn't have expected to find here.  
260  
00:24:54.230 \--\> 00:25:00.890  
P18: It's nice to know that that can now be done digitally, though.  
261  
00:25:03.580 \--\> 00:25:10.090  
Moderator: Yeah, yeah, it's a really important one, I'm glad. I'm glad we've got it.  
262  
00:25:10.340 \--\> 00:25:10.870  
P18: Yeah.  
263  
00:25:12.060 \--\> 00:25:16.509  
P18: Me too. I used to work at the VA and had several veterans who were…  
264  
00:25:17.050 \--\> 00:25:22.960  
P18: Discharged under dishonorable or other than honorable categories.  
265  
00:25:23.540 \--\> 00:25:31.599  
P18: Discharge characterizations because of being gay or, sexual or military trauma.  
266  
00:25:33.230 \--\> 00:25:38.869  
P18: Military sexual trauma, there we go. MST, yeah. So it's nice to see the…  
267  
00:25:39.520 \--\> 00:25:45.719  
P18: It doesn't apply to me, it did not apply to me, but it's nice to see that it's there.  
268  
00:25:48.070 \--\> 00:25:49.759  
P18: Yeah, totally agree.  
269  
00:25:52.600 \--\> 00:25:55.750  
Moderator: A scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate this tool?  
270  
00:25:56.150 \--\> 00:25:58.489  
Moderator: When's the worst, five's the best.  
271  
00:26:01.740 \--\> 00:26:02.590  
P18: True.  
272  
00:26:07.540 \--\> 00:26:13.090  
P18: I guess it depends on what Learn More is. Like…  
273  
00:26:13.230 \--\> 00:26:21.609  
P18: Does this walk me through how to apply it, apply for these benefits, or does this just give me a little bit of information on…  
274  
00:26:21.910 \--\> 00:26:25.869  
Moderator: Go ahead and click. I'm really curious to know…  
275  
00:26:26.630 \--\> 00:26:29.820  
Moderator: What… what you think about where… where these go.  
276  
00:26:30.160 \--\> 00:26:30.990  
P18: Okay.  
277  
00:26:31.540 \--\> 00:26:36.849  
P18: External resources, this does not include VSOs.  
278  
00:26:37.590 \--\> 00:26:41.289  
P18: Okay, so this just takes me to the state.  
279  
00:26:42.460 \--\> 00:26:43.600  
P18: veterans.  
280  
00:26:43.800 \--\> 00:26:47.450  
P18: That makes sense. Oh, and it's even got the…  
281  
00:26:50.710 \--\> 00:26:53.349  
P18: Outside of CONUS ones.  
282  
00:26:53.980 \--\> 00:27:09.190  
P18: Okay… state VA offices. That… Makes sense. Yeah, that it's got… It links directly to these.  
283  
00:27:10.040 \--\> 00:27:10.890  
P18: Nice.  
284  
00:27:11.240 \--\> 00:27:12.559  
P18: I like to see that.  
285  
00:27:13.750 \--\> 00:27:23.580  
P18: What about this one? Discharge upgrade. Yeah, so it tells you how to apply, and I'm guessing that the Get Started button would allow me to start  
286  
00:27:23.970 \--\> 00:27:27.060  
P18: Applying for a discharge upgrade in this case.  
287  
00:27:28.100 \--\> 00:27:28.929  
Moderator: Yep, that's correct.  
288  
00:27:32.410 \--\> 00:27:38.930  
P18: So in that case, I would say that… It is… pretty handy,  
289  
00:27:41.780 \--\> 00:27:49.369  
P18: I would say right now, I would put it at a 4, but with a few little tweaks, I would probably say it's at a 5\.  
290  
00:27:49.640 \--\> 00:27:50.210  
P18: That's…  
291  
00:27:50.210 \--\> 00:28:08.050  
Moderator: Those… are those things like, you know, the things you were mentioning, like… like sorting, getting rid of expiration date for… for veterans who, you know, are significantly past their separation from the military, that, you know, the… the issues you already raised?  
292  
00:28:08.340 \--\> 00:28:09.310  
P18: Yes, exactly.  
293  
00:28:09.310 \--\> 00:28:10.100  
Moderator: Gotcha.  
294  
00:28:11.060 \--\> 00:28:14.629  
Moderator: Is there anything else you want to share with us about  
295  
00:28:15.200 \--\> 00:28:24.909  
Moderator: either this tool or, anything you think VAs should know about your process of applying for benefits?  
296  
00:28:26.570 \--\> 00:28:30.249  
P18: I like that you can access this tool without having logged in.  
297  
00:28:30.950 \--\> 00:28:40.230  
P18: So, people who don't necessarily have a… or who do not have a VAgov profile yet, or don't know how to use the VAgov website, that they can  
298  
00:28:40.450 \--\> 00:28:41.720  
P18: access that.  
299  
00:28:41.850 \--\> 00:28:45.130  
P18: That's all I've got.  
300  
00:28:46.090 \--\> 00:28:48.219  
P18: You know, that's not super helpful, but…  
301  
00:28:48.220 \--\> 00:29:06.839  
Moderator: Oh, no, that is extremely helpful. That's the, you know, that's… that's a kind of big picture insight about, you know, where this lives, who's it… who's it for, how it works. We really… we really need to know that. And, yeah, we've… you've given us so much helpful information and insights.  
302  
00:29:07.170 \--\> 00:29:13.100  
Moderator: I want to circle back about recording consent. Let me get to my notes.  
303  
00:29:17.480 \--\> 00:29:34.579  
Moderator: So I want to circle back and reconfirm, if you're comfortable, if we share a video of the session with our VA partners. Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and will only share with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.  
304  
00:29:35.230 \--\> 00:29:35.820  
P18: Yes.  
305  
00:29:35.900 \--\> 00:29:39.720  
Moderator: Is there any part of our discussion you would not want to share in a video club?  
306  
00:29:40.240 \--\> 00:29:40.760  
P18: No, ma'am.  
307  
00:29:41.090 \--\> 00:30:00.469  
Moderator: Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans. And finally, Perigian will be sending you a thank you note, the little blurb. You can pass along to other veterans you may know, provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.  
308  
00:30:00.480 \--\> 00:30:07.069  
Moderator: And, are you interested in having a link to the live version of this tool?  
309  
00:30:07.530 \--\> 00:30:07.980  
P18: Yeah.  
310  
00:30:07.980 \--\> 00:30:09.719  
Moderator: Okay, that'd be great for you.  
311  
00:30:20.760 \--\> 00:30:34.220  
Moderator: It looks a little different, because it doesn't have the updates that we are testing right now, but it is available, so when you are ready to buy a house, or whatever other benefit you want to look into, it'll be there.  
312  
00:30:34.790 \--\> 00:30:36.750  
P18: Excellent, very cool.  
313  
00:30:37.210 \--\> 00:30:42.810  
P18: Oh, that's awesome. Oh, now I can't figure out how to get back to us. Oh, there we go.  
314  
00:30:42.810 \--\> 00:30:43.759  
Moderator: Are you?  
315  
00:30:44.180 \--\> 00:30:47.289  
Moderator: Well, thank you so much\! I hope you have a great day.  
316  
00:30:47.500 \--\> 00:30:49.399  
P18: Thank you. Thanks for all you guys do.  
317  
00:30:49.980 \--\> 00:30:51.230  
Moderator: Thank you, bye.
