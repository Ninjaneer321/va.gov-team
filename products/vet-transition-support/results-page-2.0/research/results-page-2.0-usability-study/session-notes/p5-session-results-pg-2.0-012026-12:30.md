| Assistive tech | N/A |
| Comfort with technology | Very |
| About device and accessibility tech |  |
| What services they use on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) | uses services related to GI bill, housing stipend, medical services (speak to psych services, medication requests), general research (for VR\&E) transitioned out 4 years ago after being medically separated in 2022\. logging in and using site: once or twice every day (due to time of month, waiting for paycheck; and time of year, looking for info about new semester). Avg week: 1-2 times a day to make sure he's got info he needs for his appointments. |
| Complete questionnaire easily | Yes |
| Questionnaire observations | on macbook, comet browser (AI-assisted browser)--can use chrome if any errors easily finds get started clicks school (just because), career ("that could be fun"), understand my benefits (really likes this option--helpful for him when he was medically separated; "Good on you guys: that's awesome\!") time served: has to do some calculating (only because the time break ups were different than he expected (usually sees years and not months, but he feels like "this \[what DYB does\] makes a lot more sense" and would make some service members feel more comfortable.) other options easy until separation, then has to do some thinking separation: slowed a little. never seen uncharacterized. Medical separation gives him some hesitancy because he's got honorable separation but it's under medical conditions. He would appreciate some way to disambiguate between honorable and honorable \+ medical conditions. Medical separation process is different, and opening up a va.gov website questions don't totally align with that process. Really likes the accordion menu to review. Gives opportunity to go back and fix things or just see what DYB is using to make recommendations. He goes through each one to re-check. |
| Finding sort | No |
| Notes on finding sort | he just scrolled through. Guessing that sorting is based on goals he selected as part of the questionnaire Anna pointed it out. "I feel silly for not noticing that." |
| Use sort as expected? | No |
| Notes on using sort | Didn't use it because he didn't notice it. |
| Finding filters | Yes |
| Notes on finding filters | after separation, since that's his circumstance (doesn't notice any changes) But he didn't use/discuss any others |
| Use filters as expected? | Yes with help |
| Notes on using filters | used it post-task for housing assistance. |
| Exploring and understanding recommended vs all | Yes with help |
| Notes on recommended vs all | "not entirely sure" about what "only results recommended..." filter would do. unclicks, understands that the "when to apply" is the reason for things like VGLI and ECC/Ch.36; disability stuff because he's got a rating already. (able to understand and see why he didn't see those things when the box was checked) Likes to see note about the Colmery/forever GI bill window, since it would be really helpful for someone to know depending on their service |
| Exploring and understanding when to apply filter | Yes |
| Notes on when to apply filter | immediately noticed it, didn't notice a change from results. |
| Found benefit information easily | Yes |
| Notes on finding benefit information | navigation: looking at everyything, seeing if anything is interesting to him. (e.g. Home loans, because he's interested in that.; VR\&E because it would've been helpful when he was doing his research): talking about DYB "That's really really cool." Clicks on "learn more" as he sees something interesting--mostly if they're related to something he's interested in or something he's never heard of. likes the state services page. "Extremely beneficial and helpful." (would appreciate knowing he can go there if he couldn't find the state office on his own). takes him to VA website: "I like that\!" learn more vs. application page: "learn more" makes a lot more sense to him might like differences in link tags for something like State Benefits, since "learn more" doesn't totally indicate what you see. But does think it's "short sweet and to the point." he's finding info that he's never seen before (benefits for small businesses, Vet Pension requirements). Attributes small biz being shown to post-separation career; not totally seeing the link to goal he selected, but he's close to it. Likes the info about contacting a VSO. |
| Is this tool helpful for you in your life today? | Somewhat |
| Notes on helpful in life today | "certain aspects of it are: yes." E.g. VA Home Loan because he's interested in using it soon. Some he already has general knowledge about, others that he's just not eligible for, so he might look at the non-eligible benefits for other people/friends to help make them aware of those things if he thinks they're eligible. (Didn't give a star rating) |
| Satisfaction 1-5 | 5 |
| Notes on satisfaction | "Very easy to use. Very user friendly." Likes that it can be filtered by recommendations. Thinks a lot of thought and consideration was put into the tool. Would like to see info about benefits for displaced/unhoused Veterans. Anna: Services for people in crisis? Participant: Yes\! A: Would someone in crisis feel like this is for them? P: "Yes." feels like Vets understand that VA is there to help them. (jeff: it sounds like he feels like adding more benefits for displaced veterans/vets in crisis would make it more helpful to them.) P: thinks the benefit-related resources could be made more visible on va.gov generally that then helps direct them towards crisis (mental health and housing) resources. |
| What would you change about this tool to help someone transitioning from Active Duty? | 0 |
| What do you think VA should know about your experience getting benefits after transitioning? | Issues he had when he got out were with DoD/home base not with VA. (stayed in extra/unexpected amount of time, had to take out student loans, can't get them covered.) VA felt very straightforward and very easy. "I'm going to sing VA's praises." Did have some trouble with severance payment delay (6 month delay), but he understands that the VA couldn't really do anything to help that. Also had small issue with initial disability payment (slower than anticipated, agents were helpful on the phone, though) Wants VA to understand mental health is serious and can be a source of hurting/pain. |
| Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared? | No |
| Recording consent | Yes |
| Consent to share clips | Yes |

P5 transcript  
1  
00:00:08.690 \--\> 00:00:09.370  
P5: Okay.  
2  
00:00:15.210 \--\> 00:00:28.149  
Moderator: So I've got recording, I've got a transcript going, we're already on my end, and now that I've started recording, I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?  
3  
00:00:28.150 \--\> 00:00:29.110  
P5: Yes, I am.  
4  
00:00:29.110 \--\> 00:00:38.709  
Moderator: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?  
5  
00:00:38.920 \--\> 00:00:39.699  
P5: Yes, I am.  
6  
00:00:39.700 \--\> 00:00:47.239  
Moderator: Okay, great. Let's get started. So, first, what services do you use on VA.gov?  
7  
00:00:47.780 \--\> 00:00:56.109  
P5: So, a lot of the services that I use are relating to educational benefits, so tracking how much time is left on my GI bill.  
8  
00:00:56.600 \--\> 00:01:08.500  
P5: much I'm gonna be paid for housing stipends, when I can expect these payments. I also use the medical services portion of it, too, to…  
9  
00:01:08.600 \--\> 00:01:18.279  
P5: Speak with my primary care doctors… well, not primary care, but my psychologist, my psychiatrist, use it to request medications, messaging.  
10  
00:01:18.430 \--\> 00:01:29.600  
P5: And then also just, doing, like, general research, because I was considering trying to apply for the VR\&E, and I wanted to go onto the VA website and just kind of do some general research about it.  
11  
00:01:30.280 \--\> 00:01:36.939  
Moderator: So if you're looking into VRE, sounds like you've transitioned out of the Navy very recently.  
12  
00:01:36.940 \--\> 00:01:47.469  
P5: Yes, so I am coming up on 4 years of being a veteran. I was medically separated at the end of September.  
13  
00:01:48.660 \--\> 00:01:53.629  
P5: Sorry, that was… that's super funny. The end of September 2022\.  
14  
00:01:53.630 \--\> 00:01:54.790  
Moderator: This is petty.  
15  
00:01:54.970 \--\> 00:01:55.590  
P5: Okay.  
16  
00:01:56.100 \--\> 00:01:56.790  
P5: I love it.  
17  
00:01:59.880 \--\> 00:02:18.639  
Moderator: Yeah, so you separated in, in 2022, 4 years into being a veteran, and, yeah, so it sounds like you're currently using education benefits. How often are, would you say that you're logging in and using the website?  
18  
00:02:18.870 \--\> 00:02:28.659  
P5: I would say, due to the fact that I'm still waiting on final confirmation for my benefits to be confirmed for this month, or for this,  
19  
00:02:30.850 \--\> 00:02:44.369  
P5: Semester, that's the word that I was looking for, semester. I'm on it quite frequently, I would say, like, once or twice every day, just to… also, like, it's the time of the month where I go to look at… to see if my, paycheck is…  
20  
00:02:44.670 \--\> 00:02:46.110  
P5: is pending.  
21  
00:02:47.500 \--\> 00:02:52.329  
P5: Oh, boy. Hold on, sorry, my computer decided to freak out a little bit.  
22  
00:02:52.720 \--\> 00:02:55.420  
Moderator: No worries No rush.  
23  
00:02:56.190 \--\> 00:02:56.900  
P5: Alright.  
24  
00:02:57.280 \--\> 00:02:58.740  
P5: Okay, it did everything.  
25  
00:02:59.460 \--\> 00:03:04.320  
P5: Okay, cool. Alright, everything's back working. Sorry, accidentally kicked my,  
26  
00:03:04.720 \--\> 00:03:06.860  
P5: Kicked something, and it turned off my…  
27  
00:03:07.800 \--\> 00:03:23.620  
P5: docking system. But I would say, on an average week, I access the website one to two times a day. When I have appointments during that week, it's commonly a little bit more, just because I want to make sure that I have all the information that I need for my appointments.  
28  
00:03:24.040 \--\> 00:03:24.660  
Moderator: Done it.  
29  
00:03:25.010 \--\> 00:03:32.559  
Moderator: Oh, yeah, thanks. That's really good to know. That helps give some context to, to the tests we're doing.  
30  
00:03:32.950 \--\> 00:03:40.970  
Moderator: So, getting started with testing the prototype, I am going to drop a link in the chat that I'd like you to click.  
31  
00:03:41.520 \--\> 00:03:42.319  
P5: Yeah, of course.  
32  
00:03:42.320 \--\> 00:03:47.600  
Moderator: And, before we get started, can you tell me what… what kind of computer, what browser you're on?  
33  
00:03:47.780 \--\> 00:03:55.630  
P5: I have a MacBook, and I use… Comet, which is a…  
34  
00:03:55.830 \--\> 00:03:59.630  
P5: generative AI browser that's produced by Perplexity.  
35  
00:03:59.910 \--\> 00:04:07.180  
P5: But I commonly don't have any issues, like, opening up links or anything like that, and if there's, for some reason, an issue, I can always switch over to Chrome.  
36  
00:04:07.180 \--\> 00:04:12.889  
Moderator: Do you have a hard stop at 1.30? Or 1, sorry, 1.15?  
37  
00:04:15.740 \--\> 00:04:20.250  
P5: You're about to access a development port search by someone's Codespace.  
38  
00:04:20.510 \--\> 00:04:28.040  
Moderator: Yeah, this, go ahead and click continue. It's telling you that,  
39  
00:04:28.280 \--\> 00:04:31.869  
Moderator: Yeah, it's telling you that you're entering our engineer's code space.  
40  
00:04:32.160 \--\> 00:04:33.600  
P5: Yeah, that's what I…  
41  
00:04:34.340 \--\> 00:04:39.659  
P5: it just opened up one of my tabs, and I was doing a little bit of job hunting before we,  
42  
00:04:40.100 \--\> 00:04:43.140  
P5: started this, so I just wanted to minimize everything.  
43  
00:04:43.400 \--\> 00:04:51.539  
Moderator: Cool. Alright, so it took me to the Discover Your Benefits portion of the VA webpage. Perfect, that's right where you should be. Could you please share your screen?  
44  
00:04:51.890 \--\> 00:04:53.799  
P5: Yeah, of course, give me one moment.  
45  
00:04:54.260 \--\> 00:04:57.050  
P5: Let me just get everything condensed onto one screen.  
46  
00:04:58.070 \--\> 00:05:04.139  
Moderator: Yeah, and take your time. If you need to close things down for privacy, you can go ahead and do that.  
47  
00:05:04.320 \--\> 00:05:06.130  
Moderator: I don't want to rush you.  
48  
00:05:13.610 \--\> 00:05:20.369  
P5: irate, wow… alright, cool, I should be, sharing my screen now.  
49  
00:05:20.370 \--\> 00:05:34.319  
Moderator: Yep, I'm seeing your desktop with the comment window in it. And, I have a few follow-up questions about how you might be using AI tools to interact with VA.gov.  
50  
00:05:34.320 \--\> 00:05:34.860  
P5: Yeah.  
51  
00:05:34.860 \--\> 00:05:37.890  
Moderator: Of course. Do you have a few minutes at the end to talk through that?  
52  
00:05:38.060 \--\> 00:05:39.359  
P5: Yeah, I should.  
53  
00:05:39.360 \--\> 00:05:54.750  
Moderator: Yeah, because I've noticed that more and more veterans are doing that, I've noticed that some people are doing chats with their, about benefits and searching the site using ChatGPT or Grok, and yeah, I'm really interested in how that's working, because I think it's  
54  
00:05:55.250 \--\> 00:05:58.859  
Moderator: In the future, it's going to be a bigger part of how people interact with our tools.  
55  
00:05:59.260 \--\> 00:06:00.340  
P5: 100%.  
56  
00:06:00.340 \--\> 00:06:04.910  
Moderator: Yeah, so, do you have a hard stop at 1.15?  
57  
00:06:10.450 \--\> 00:06:11.870  
Moderator: Or,  
58  
00:06:18.530 \--\> 00:06:26.270  
Moderator: Alright, so, what I'd like you to do with this prototype, I'd like you to interact with it just like you interact with, you know, VA.gov.  
59  
00:06:26.470 \--\> 00:06:48.440  
Moderator: It's a tool to help you understand… discover and understand benefits that might be useful or interesting to you, and I'd like you to use it as if I weren't here. The only difference is I'd like you to speak out loud and tell me what you're thinking, feeling, noticing, and, especially anything that's going wrong, anything that is acting like you don't expect it.  
60  
00:06:48.440 \--\> 00:06:53.550  
Moderator: It will be a little laggier than VA.gov as a whole, because it is a Codespaces prototype.  
61  
00:06:53.830 \--\> 00:06:55.369  
P5: Oh, yeah, absolutely, I gotcha.  
62  
00:06:55.650 \--\> 00:06:56.520  
Moderator: Cool.  
63  
00:06:56.880 \--\> 00:06:59.479  
P5: Alright, let's go ahead and click get started.  
64  
00:06:59.760 \--\> 00:07:01.640  
P5: Alright, Discover Benefits.  
65  
00:07:02.000 \--\> 00:07:04.110  
P5: What goals do you want to accomplish?  
66  
00:07:04.650 \--\> 00:07:10.560  
P5: Just because. Don't… interesting, that could be fun.  
67  
00:07:15.670 \--\> 00:07:19.859  
P5: I really like this, this Understand My Benefits, because I've done…  
68  
00:07:20.360 \--\> 00:07:28.329  
P5: I've done the… I did this survey, or something similar to this, when I was… prior to me being medically separated, when I was creating my VA account.  
69  
00:07:28.710 \--\> 00:07:36.020  
P5: And I took something similar like this, like, on a understand-what-your-benefits-are And,  
70  
00:07:36.150 \--\> 00:07:41.890  
P5: And I never actually have seen an… I never saw an answer like that, and I really like that.  
71  
00:07:42.580 \--\> 00:07:45.040  
P5: So I want to say good on you guys, that's awesome.  
72  
00:07:46.170 \--\> 00:07:51.979  
Moderator: Yeah, thank you. That's, kind of one of the main purposes of the tool, so I'm really glad that that's coming through.  
73  
00:07:52.420 \--\> 00:07:55.900  
P5: Yeah, no, absolutely. How long did you serve in the military?  
74  
00:08:03.600 \--\> 00:08:05.380  
P5: We're used to less than 10\.  
75  
00:08:06.260 \--\> 00:08:10.610  
P5: Alright, maybe… Active duty.  
76  
00:08:11.380 \--\> 00:08:13.610  
P5: Currently, no, I'm not.  
77  
00:08:13.820 \--\> 00:08:16.189  
P5: Separation, how long? Oof.  
78  
00:08:20.530 \--\> 00:08:22.030  
P5: Yeah, 3 plus years.  
79  
00:08:23.080 \--\> 00:08:25.729  
P5: What's the highest character of this trade you've ever seen?  
80  
00:08:26.270 \--\> 00:08:33.340  
P5: Honorable… Okay, yeah. Continue.  
81  
00:08:33.340 \--\> 00:08:37.389  
Moderator: Do you, were there answers you didn't expect to see there?  
82  
00:08:37.669 \--\> 00:08:38.419  
P5: On the.  
83  
00:08:38.419 \--\> 00:08:39.059  
Moderator: at all.  
84  
00:08:39.059 \--\> 00:08:47.389  
P5: So… it's not that I didn't expect to see some of them. This uncharacterized is actually interesting, I've never seen that before.  
85  
00:08:47.809 \--\> 00:09:05.949  
P5: One thing that I would say is I… so I was medically separated, like I had said prior to our, prior to the recording beginning, and something that I always have… not necessarily a hard time with, but sometimes it's kind of given me a little bit of hesitancy, especially on, like, the VA website, is…  
86  
00:09:06.009 \--\> 00:09:21.329  
P5: because I was medically separated, I do have an honorable separation, but it's underneath medical conditions, so maybe… this is just, like, my own personal opinion, maybe you guys could do something that says honorable, and then you could…  
87  
00:09:21.789 \--\> 00:09:27.779  
P5: like, put a comment down or something after that. Like, say, honorable see comment.  
88  
00:09:29.970 \--\> 00:09:35.560  
Moderator: Yeah. So, for example, hmm.  
89  
00:09:38.780 \--\> 00:09:46.969  
Moderator: It sounds like you… like, the fact that it was a medical separation is something that is important for people at VA to know.  
90  
00:09:46.970 \--\> 00:09:47.669  
P5: Yeah, so…  
91  
00:09:47.670 \--\> 00:09:47.990  
Moderator: Okay.  
92  
00:09:48.310 \--\> 00:09:51.179  
P5: So, because of the… so I was…  
93  
00:09:51.350 \--\> 00:10:05.520  
P5: my medical issues were due to injuries obtained while on active duty service. I, and I know that when I was going through the process of, like, filing claims, I didn't have to do that manually because I was being  
94  
00:10:05.770 \--\> 00:10:14.389  
P5: medically… I was in a medical board process while I was still in the Navy. I was being… I was… I don't want to say given a VA representative, but I was…  
95  
00:10:15.030 \--\> 00:10:25.230  
P5: provided the opportunity to work with a representative who knows how to make filings for the VA on behalf of service members. So he was the one that did a majority of this for me.  
96  
00:10:25.380 \--\> 00:10:28.709  
P5: But when I had to open up my own account.  
97  
00:10:29.230 \--\> 00:10:34.209  
P5: and do it through the VA website a couple months before I was separated.  
98  
00:10:35.000 \--\> 00:10:40.840  
P5: I had a lot of questions that I couldn't get answered necessarily, a lot of which was pertaining to, like.  
99  
00:10:40.970 \--\> 00:10:46.070  
P5: okay, how do I answer some of these? Because I… I genuinely did not know.  
100  
00:10:46.510 \--\> 00:10:48.349  
P5: And one of them was the,  
101  
00:10:49.620 \--\> 00:10:52.120  
P5: A question about a discharge type, because  
102  
00:10:52.890 \--\> 00:10:59.639  
P5: Now, I know that it is honorable. I genuinely know that now. But at the time, it was kind of like.  
103  
00:10:59.810 \--\> 00:11:06.900  
P5: I don't know what it is, because yes, it… I… yes, I didn't get in any trouble, but there are…  
104  
00:11:08.020 \--\> 00:11:14.019  
P5: Other aspects that go into my separation, outside of just my… my time is up.  
105  
00:11:14.600 \--\> 00:11:17.579  
P5: If that makes sense. That was a little bit of a long-winded answer.  
106  
00:11:17.580 \--\> 00:11:32.920  
Moderator: No, that's really helpful because I hadn't heard anybody explain it that explicitly before, that there's, you know, the character, which is honorable, or general, or dishonorable, but then there's also the circumstances, and that maybe people don't know that  
107  
00:11:33.390 \--\> 00:11:37.210  
Moderator: That a… that a med board, like, that a medical discharge  
108  
00:11:37.330 \--\> 00:11:42.379  
Moderator: has a character, so maybe we need to explain that more clearly. Yeah, thanks for that insight.  
109  
00:11:42.560 \--\> 00:11:45.980  
P5: Yeah, of course. Alright. Am I good to move on from the screen?  
110  
00:11:45.980 \--\> 00:11:46.540  
Moderator: Yeah.  
111  
00:11:46.710 \--\> 00:11:49.710  
P5: Alright, cool. Alright, do you have a disability rating?  
112  
00:11:52.460 \--\> 00:11:54.670  
P5: Yes, I filed a claim in.  
113  
00:11:54.670 \--\> 00:11:55.050  
Moderator: I see.  
114  
00:11:55.050 \--\> 00:11:55.710  
P5: you've…  
115  
00:11:55.710 \--\> 00:12:10.059  
Moderator: Going back a couple of questions, just because it's related, did you notice on the… on the question about how long did you serve? Did that feel right to you? Did you have any questions about that one based on,  
116  
00:12:10.060 \--\> 00:12:10.909  
P5: This one?  
117  
00:12:10.910 \--\> 00:12:11.620  
Moderator: Yeah.  
118  
00:12:12.920 \--\> 00:12:18.780  
P5: No, I think that this is the first time that I've ever seen it broken up like this before, because…  
119  
00:12:19.070 \--\> 00:12:26.269  
P5: I've never seen it go from as low as 4 months. The lowest that I've ever seen was commonly less than 1 year.  
120  
00:12:26.970 \--\> 00:12:34.899  
P5: And then… and then, like, it would be less than 1 year would be right there, and then more than one year to…  
121  
00:12:36.180 \--\> 00:12:41.349  
P5: Oh, man, what was it? I think it would commonly be, like, 4 years, and then it'd be 4 to 10…  
122  
00:12:41.930 \--\> 00:12:49.830  
P5: And then it would be 10 to 20, and then above 20\. So, outside of, like, the main difference of being months versus, like, a year.  
123  
00:12:50.560 \--\> 00:12:52.020  
P5: This… this seems right.  
124  
00:12:52.280 \--\> 00:12:54.160  
P5: And it actually makes a lot more…  
125  
00:12:54.420 \--\> 00:12:59.079  
Moderator: It makes a lot more sense, and I feel like for individuals who may have been…  
126  
00:12:59.080 \--\> 00:13:00.720  
P5: separated…  
127  
00:13:00.850 \--\> 00:13:09.589  
P5: very early on in their careers, or very early on in their enlistments, for whatever reasons, of course, this might make them feel a little bit more comfortable, because it's like.  
128  
00:13:10.370 \--\> 00:13:22.229  
P5: oh, wow, all I see is, like, served less than one year. It's like, that kind of makes me feel… pardon my French, but, like, that would kind of make me feel like shit, like, oh, I… I did something… like, they're gonna think I did something wrong, they're gonna think I did…  
129  
00:13:22.890 \--\> 00:13:24.910  
P5: Did this, that, or the third that…  
130  
00:13:25.320 \--\> 00:13:28.820  
P5: I'm being punished for through being removed.  
131  
00:13:29.290 \--\> 00:13:30.150  
Moderator: Right.  
132  
00:13:30.740 \--\> 00:13:33.030  
P5: So, I will say that that's kind of a nice little…  
133  
00:13:33.190 \--\> 00:13:39.050  
P5: That was a good little addition. I liked seeing this, personally. And then, of course, it's just, like, the general time frame of…  
134  
00:13:40.230 \--\> 00:13:43.160  
P5: Like, 4-5ish years of a gap.  
135  
00:13:43.820 \--\> 00:13:52.450  
Moderator: Yeah, okay, that's really good to know. Yeah, it's really important that everyone feels like their service is  
136  
00:13:52.640 \--\> 00:14:02.200  
Moderator: valid. We never want to make anybody think that they're not a veteran. So yeah, it's… it's really good to hear that that's… that's hitting that right note.  
137  
00:14:02.830 \--\> 00:14:10.220  
P5: Alright, let's go back. Continue, continue… Yep, okay, cool.  
138  
00:14:10.500 \--\> 00:14:13.070  
P5: Alright.  
139  
00:14:13.350 \--\> 00:14:31.910  
P5: Let's see here, goals… Okay, I like this. I really like this screen. I don't know if this is new or if I just never noticed this before, but having… like, giving us the ability to, like, review and maybe adjust something, because maybe we clicked on something accidentally, or, like…  
140  
00:14:32.070 \--\> 00:14:42.899  
P5: to… or, like, just kind of giving you a general reminder of, like, hey, these are the answers that you chose, are… like, this is what we're gonna go based off of. I… this is really, really nice.  
141  
00:14:44.510 \--\> 00:14:45.310  
Moderator: Awesome.  
142  
00:14:47.280 \--\> 00:14:48.240  
P5: Cleaning.  
143  
00:14:51.980 \--\> 00:15:00.409  
P5: Okay, cool. Alright, I've read and accepted privacy policy.  
144  
00:15:01.080 \--\> 00:15:04.340  
P5: Okay. Discover your benefits.  
145  
00:15:05.620 \--\> 00:15:09.380  
P5: So we can go back and… oh, cool. Okay.  
146  
00:15:10.280 \--\> 00:15:17.000  
P5: When to apply… I'm gonna do after separation, just because of the fact that it's a little bit late for before.  
147  
00:15:18.520 \--\> 00:15:20.819  
P5: I'd be a little bit confused.  
148  
00:15:21.040 \--\> 00:15:23.970  
P5: Alright, let's do this one. Apply filters.  
149  
00:15:25.050 \--\> 00:15:31.159  
P5: Okay, cool. Alright, nothing changed. All right, let's see, recommended for your disability, disability…  
150  
00:15:35.800 \--\> 00:15:36.730  
P5: Okay.  
151  
00:15:47.350 \--\> 00:15:48.360  
P5: Okay.  
152  
00:15:53.910 \--\> 00:15:58.779  
P5: I like this. This is nice. This is really nice. I like this.  
153  
00:16:03.490 \--\> 00:16:10.980  
P5: Yeah, no, I… I've… This is extremely beneficial, and extremely helpful, because…  
154  
00:16:11.740 \--\> 00:16:20.370  
P5: granted, I live in a very military-friendly state, or, well, active duty state, I should say that. It's nice to be able to…  
155  
00:16:20.840 \--\> 00:16:38.609  
P5: like, come to a website, and in, like, for some reason, if I couldn't find, like, the Virginia Department of Veterans Services phone number, or where my nearest one is, or I couldn't find the website, knowing that I could just go to a portion of the VA website, click a link, and then be brought to that is really, really nice.  
156  
00:16:39.850 \--\> 00:16:42.110  
Moderator: What state are you in?  
157  
00:16:42.330 \--\> 00:16:43.080  
P5: Virginia.  
158  
00:16:43.080 \--\> 00:16:47.699  
Moderator: Virginia, okay. Oh yeah, they have a ton of resources in Virginia.  
159  
00:16:47.700 \--\> 00:16:48.999  
P5: Oh, no, 100%.  
160  
00:16:49.000 \--\> 00:17:00.220  
Moderator: Were you aware of all those resources that are listed on that… that… I'm assuming, because you know about the resources, that you've been to the, to the Virginia.  
161  
00:17:00.490 \--\> 00:17:12.170  
P5: Okay, so… I… How many? Yeah, so I have been to a Virginia Department of Veterans Service office before.  
162  
00:17:12.480 \--\> 00:17:17.530  
P5: I was originally gonna try and get my, disability upgraded.  
163  
00:17:17.930 \--\> 00:17:24.689  
P5: That was my prior… that was my primary reason for going there, but I'm actually kind of curious what you guys have for Virginia.  
164  
00:17:25.780 \--\> 00:17:33.420  
P5: Vermont… Island, Virgin Island… here we go, Virginia Department of Vet Services.  
165  
00:17:33.690 \--\> 00:17:36.839  
P5: Okay, cool, and then it takes you directly to the webpage. I like that.  
166  
00:17:38.350 \--\> 00:17:39.250  
P5: Nice.  
167  
00:17:39.960 \--\> 00:17:48.670  
Moderator: And, now that you're off the VA page, are you feeling confident about returning to the page where you started with the benefit list?  
168  
00:17:51.020 \--\> 00:18:00.929  
P5: I mean, for the most part, I could… if I don't know how to get somewhere, I just… and I want to get back to it, I just commonly backspace it to it, but…  
169  
00:18:03.130 \--\> 00:18:10.790  
P5: Okay, so I'll just go to the general VA webpage and then discover benefits. Okay, so, simple, easy, to the point. I like it.  
170  
00:18:17.670 \--\> 00:18:18.430  
P5: Okay.  
171  
00:18:20.410 \--\> 00:18:26.659  
P5: So when you're… when you're scrolling up and down here, how are you navigating? How are you deciding what to read?  
172  
00:18:26.930 \--\> 00:18:29.920  
P5: So, I'm looking at everything.  
173  
00:18:30.180 \--\> 00:18:36.710  
P5: I think that right now, I'm just kind of seeing if there's anything that catches my interest. Like, I can tell you…  
174  
00:18:36.810 \--\> 00:18:53.620  
P5: A few things that I'm… that I want to click on, that I'm considering, are definitely things pertaining to home loans, because that's going to be something that my wife and I are going to be coming up on fairly soon, because we're about to PCS, up to probably Maryland, not too far from now.  
175  
00:18:54.680 \--\> 00:19:04.159  
P5: And then, if there's anything, like, like the VRNE, like, this was… this is really nice to… this would have been super helpful to see if I would have done it.  
176  
00:19:05.060 \--\> 00:19:14.769  
P5: if I would have seen it, like, when I was doing the research for VR\&E, whenever that was, I think it was a few months ago, I could just click it right here and then learn more from it. That's really, really cool.  
177  
00:19:15.930 \--\> 00:19:25.739  
Moderator: So it sounds like, we had a design decision to make with these cards where we could put Learn More, or we could go directly to the application page.  
178  
00:19:26.450 \--\> 00:19:31.629  
Moderator: Do you like seeing Learn More? Does that make sense to you, or would it make sense?  
179  
00:19:31.630 \--\> 00:19:32.030  
P5: Yes.  
180  
00:19:32.030 \--\> 00:19:32.370  
Moderator: there'.  
181  
00:19:32.370 \--\> 00:19:44.329  
P5: you know, learn more makes a lot more sense to me. And then, because maybe you're just trying to… maybe somebody's just trying to answer, or get a simple question answered, and they don't want to have to, like, navigate through a completely new web page.  
182  
00:19:45.050 \--\> 00:19:52.629  
P5: that's something nice, or that'd be nice, because it's like, oh, I can just click Learn More on Veteran Success… Vet Success on Campus.  
183  
00:19:53.400 \--\> 00:19:56.800  
P5: And then you can just get brought right to here, and it's like…  
184  
00:19:57.110 \--\> 00:20:02.960  
P5: oh, I heard about the Fry Scholarship from one of my friends at school.  
185  
00:20:03.290 \--\> 00:20:12.040  
P5: as a dependent, at least one of the… you're eligible for the… if you're eligible for the Thrive Scholarship, then you might be eligible for Vet Success.  
186  
00:20:15.540 \--\> 00:20:20.720  
P5: No, so it makes a lot more sense just to do, like, the… Like, Seymour…  
187  
00:20:20.850 \--\> 00:20:29.070  
P5: or… what was it? Was it 2 more? Learn more. And then, maybe what you guys could do is, you could always do something for, like, a…  
188  
00:20:29.340 \--\> 00:20:30.150  
P5: like…  
189  
00:20:31.810 \--\> 00:20:38.430  
P5: For state veterans benefits or something like that. You could always do, like, another little hyperlink and do  
190  
00:20:38.570 \--\> 00:20:40.469  
P5: Click to search for your shade.  
191  
00:20:41.560 \--\> 00:20:44.700  
P5: Or, like, see state lists, or something like that.  
192  
00:20:44.700 \--\> 00:20:45.780  
Moderator: Well, actually…  
193  
00:20:45.990 \--\> 00:20:48.440  
P5: That would just take you to this page.  
194  
00:20:50.990 \--\> 00:20:53.599  
P5: But, you were saying?  
195  
00:20:53.740 \--\> 00:20:59.459  
Moderator: Oh, do you feel like you need to see that before you get to the page, or is that link enough?  
196  
00:21:00.310 \--\> 00:21:06.920  
P5: Like this for the state benefits, or, like, this for just the general little… Like, card.  
197  
00:21:06.920 \--\> 00:21:09.040  
Moderator: For, for, for state benefits.  
198  
00:21:09.560 \--\> 00:21:22.170  
P5: I would say that seeing this is nice, and it's… it's fairly self-explanatory for the most part, because it's like, you're gonna be shown a list of the different states' pages for veteran services.  
199  
00:21:24.070 \--\> 00:21:30.300  
P5: So… But I think that this definitely is… Short, sweet, to the point.  
200  
00:21:33.220 \--\> 00:21:34.013  
P5: Oh, great.  
201  
00:21:35.890 \--\> 00:21:38.019  
P5: Okay, let's see, second page.  
202  
00:21:39.230 \--\> 00:21:43.909  
P5: Okay. I have never seen something like this before on a VA website.  
203  
00:21:46.300 \--\> 00:21:49.240  
P5: Okay, I'm genuinely curious.  
204  
00:21:51.600 \--\> 00:21:55.620  
Moderator: And do you have a theory about why this specific benefit was recommended to you?  
205  
00:21:56.740 \--\> 00:22:01.590  
P5: If I had to guess on why it was recommended for me.  
206  
00:22:01.730 \--\> 00:22:06.179  
P5: I'm just gonna come back here really quick. I think that it would probably…  
207  
00:22:06.350 \--\> 00:22:08.799  
P5: Be due to the fact that  
208  
00:22:09.690 \--\> 00:22:19.580  
P5: because I've already been separated and I'm looking for things that I would apply for after separation, that's definitely a theory that I have, or maybe just, like, a…  
209  
00:22:22.010 \--\> 00:22:29.019  
P5: Trying to… Oh, what's a good way to put it? Like, trying to,  
210  
00:22:29.200 \--\> 00:22:41.990  
P5: I don't want to use a… I don't want to use this term, but, like, almost kickstart a career, like, kickstart an idea that I have. Like, maybe the… maybe the websites, or the, the algorithm that runs it, it's like, oh, he…  
211  
00:22:43.020 \--\> 00:22:53.869  
P5: he's out of… he's out of service, and he's looking up all this stuff on, like, schooling. Maybe we can try and give him a little bit of information, like, in case you want to start a business, here's some information, or like…  
212  
00:22:55.240 \--\> 00:23:00.729  
P5: But… oops, scrolled a little bit too far. No, but, like, that's really cool, because I've actually…  
213  
00:23:02.130 \--\> 00:23:06.249  
P5: I mean, it's gonna be in the future, and this is just kind of me tooting my own horn, but…  
214  
00:23:06.370 \--\> 00:23:12.770  
P5: I've actually thought about doing something like this, and then there's some education stuff over there as well, careers and employment.  
215  
00:23:15.870 \--\> 00:23:19.020  
P5: Yep, generalized rate of healthcare, that's good.  
216  
00:23:19.990 \--\> 00:23:22.960  
P5: better interferon. Okay, cool, I like that.  
217  
00:23:26.900 \--\> 00:23:30.490  
P5: Pension requirements. I've never seen something like this before.  
218  
00:23:31.660 \--\> 00:23:36.330  
P5: Okay… Let's see, eligibility for veteran pension…  
219  
00:23:39.510 \--\> 00:23:40.460  
P5: Oh, no.  
220  
00:24:04.280 \--\> 00:24:05.150  
P5: Okay.  
221  
00:24:06.590 \--\> 00:24:09.409  
P5: There we go. This is what I was gonna say.  
222  
00:24:09.730 \--\> 00:24:14.810  
P5: the eligible wartime period, I… I was gonna say, like, the only thing that I would…  
223  
00:24:14.960 \--\> 00:24:24.480  
P5: was, like, I… like, if someone's curious, like, oh, did I serve during what's classified as a war period? Well, that's right here, that's really, really good.  
224  
00:24:26.590 \--\> 00:24:30.509  
Moderator: Look, it, it anticipated your questions.  
225  
00:24:30.510 \--\> 00:24:31.170  
P5: Yes, it did.  
226  
00:24:32.320 \--\> 00:24:38.370  
Moderator: So if we could move on to a couple questions that I have about the page that…  
227  
00:24:38.370 \--\> 00:24:38.940  
P5: Absolutely.  
228  
00:24:38.940 \--\> 00:24:41.489  
Moderator: Before, he could click back.  
229  
00:24:42.230 \--\> 00:24:51.100  
Moderator: Could you tell me how you think The page is,  
230  
00:24:51.280 \--\> 00:24:55.050  
Moderator: Is prioritizing which benefits to show first.  
231  
00:24:55.770 \--\> 00:25:03.000  
P5: Yeah, I can… I can give it a shot. I mean, mind you, I'm not, like, a… I'm not a tech person all that much, but I can definitely try and…  
232  
00:25:03.150 \--\> 00:25:17.800  
P5: paint a little bit of a photo. I mean, if I had to guess, a lot of what they're putting first and foremost is things that make the most sense towards all of the things that I highlighted are important to me. So, like, I highlighted…  
233  
00:25:18.350 \--\> 00:25:29.100  
P5: GI Bill… And, like, other educational benefits, I know that I highlighted those. And then also… I selected…  
234  
00:25:29.220 \--\> 00:25:31.610  
P5: Like, oops.  
235  
00:25:32.410 \--\> 00:25:34.859  
P5: Hold on, my camera just shut off.  
236  
00:25:41.370 \--\> 00:25:45.309  
P5: Okay, there we go. Alright, that's back. Don't know what happened there. But  
237  
00:25:46.140 \--\> 00:25:49.579  
P5: And then I know that, like, some of the other things that I selected were…  
238  
00:25:49.930 \--\> 00:25:53.509  
P5: We're, like, health-related, so that explains why the,  
239  
00:25:55.420 \--\> 00:25:58.709  
P5: That explains why, like, the VA healthcare stuff is here and whatnot.  
240  
00:26:01.780 \--\> 00:26:08.039  
Moderator: Yeah. So, underneath your results, you see where it says sort expiration date soonest first?  
241  
00:26:08.570 \--\> 00:26:10.169  
P5: Yep, here we go.  
242  
00:26:10.210 \--\> 00:26:12.580  
Moderator: Did, did you see that?  
243  
00:26:12.580 \--\> 00:26:15.869  
P5: No, I did not, actually. I just now saw this.  
244  
00:26:18.250 \--\> 00:26:28.269  
P5: Okay, so, like, almost anything, whenever you load a web page, you can always sort it. That's… I like that, that's… I feel silly for now realizing that I did not see that.  
245  
00:26:28.270 \--\> 00:26:39.569  
Moderator: this is testing us. This is not testing you. So, and you're not… you're not the first person to be unsure about how things are sorted, and,  
246  
00:26:40.330 \--\> 00:26:52.189  
Moderator: you know, some… some people would like to see it organized by type of benefit. Some people would like to see it sorted by what's going to expire first. So, yeah, this is something on us. This is how we… something we need to figure out.  
247  
00:26:52.460 \--\> 00:26:58.060  
Moderator: So, next question for you, would…  
248  
00:26:58.700 \--\> 00:27:07.100  
Moderator: Okay, so you see under filters, where it says, show results, show only results recommended for you. What do you think is going to happen if you uncheck that?  
249  
00:27:10.580 \--\> 00:27:14.369  
P5: I'm not entirely sure, actually. If I had to guess…  
250  
00:27:17.600 \--\> 00:27:26.230  
P5: Maybe there's gonna be… things that I might not be eligible for, because I know that, like,  
251  
00:27:26.410 \--\> 00:27:41.619  
P5: may… I know that one of the questions that I clicked yes to was, yes, I do have a disability that's rated, maybe something there is gonna be, like, filing for disability for the first time, or something along those lines. Do you mind if I unclick it and apply it?  
252  
00:27:41.620 \--\> 00:27:42.390  
Moderator: Of course\!  
253  
00:27:42.930 \--\> 00:27:46.970  
P5: Alright, let's go. I'm curious. Okay, so I gained 4\.  
254  
00:27:47.250 \--\> 00:27:51.339  
P5: Education and Career Counseling, Chapter 36\.  
255  
00:27:51.520 \--\> 00:28:01.080  
P5: Okay, cool. That's awesome. Up to 180 days before you separate from service, or up to 1 year. Okay, cool, cool.  
256  
00:28:02.920 \--\> 00:28:06.569  
Moderator: Is it clear to you why those weren't recommended for you?  
257  
00:28:06.570 \--\> 00:28:08.970  
P5: The when to apply.  
258  
00:28:09.020 \--\> 00:28:14.139  
Moderator: Because it's… I think it's fair to say I've been out for more than 180 days. Yeah.  
259  
00:28:14.140 \--\> 00:28:22.569  
P5: And then, of course, like, the VGLI, that's something that I kind of kicked myself for not doing, but, like, again, up to 1 year and 120 days after separation.  
260  
00:28:24.700 \--\> 00:28:25.340  
Moderator: Yep.  
261  
00:28:25.340 \--\> 00:28:27.530  
P5: Oh, yep, disability compensation.  
262  
00:28:28.410 \--\> 00:28:29.620  
Moderator: Because you already have it.  
263  
00:28:29.620 \--\> 00:28:32.769  
P5: Yep, and then Disability Housing Grant. Okay, I didn't…  
264  
00:28:33.450 \--\> 00:28:38.500  
P5: I didn't see this. If you have certain service-connected disabilities, you can apply for a housing grant to help…  
265  
00:28:39.250 \--\> 00:28:42.270  
P5: Oh, okay, cool. Alright, I like that.  
266  
00:28:42.460 \--\> 00:28:47.739  
Moderator: Yeah, a lot of people don't know about that benefit, so it's for, like, wheelchair ramps, for example.  
267  
00:28:47.740 \--\> 00:28:49.349  
P5: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.  
268  
00:28:49.740 \--\> 00:28:51.640  
P5: Okay, cool. I like that.  
269  
00:28:52.090 \--\> 00:28:55.650  
P5: Alright, and then it looks like everything else is things that I've already,  
270  
00:28:57.090 \--\> 00:29:05.220  
P5: Yep, if you separated before. I like that you guys put this little note here, especially because if someone who separated…  
271  
00:29:07.010 \--\> 00:29:17.870  
P5: like, before that time is now just wanting to go back to college. They understand, like, oh, I only have a specific amount of time left. Like, I like that you guys put that there.  
272  
00:29:20.170 \--\> 00:29:24.609  
P5: Okay, cool, yeah, so it was those… so it was pretty much the first four that…  
273  
00:29:24.770 \--\> 00:29:31.190  
P5: That weren't highlighted for me, and it was all based on of, like, Separation timeframe.  
274  
00:29:31.320 \--\> 00:29:31.910  
Moderator: Yeah.  
275  
00:29:32.670 \--\> 00:29:34.140  
P5: Okay, cool, I like that.  
276  
00:29:34.370 \--\> 00:29:37.399  
Moderator: So, it sounds like you didn't find it right away, but…  
277  
00:29:37.580 \--\> 00:29:44.130  
Moderator: And then… but then you did have a sense of why something was or wasn't displayed for you once you found it.  
278  
00:29:44.130 \--\> 00:29:49.550  
P5: Yeah, I kind of put two and two together, after I… because after I read this one.  
279  
00:29:50.050 \--\> 00:29:55.429  
P5: It kind of put… it made sense that it was recommended to me at this point, because  
280  
00:29:57.270 \--\> 00:30:04.939  
P5: when I… when I had started doing the, the survey at the beginning, I said that, oh, I was…  
281  
00:30:05.560 \--\> 00:30:06.310  
P5: like…  
282  
00:30:07.000 \--\> 00:30:22.729  
P5: I can't remember if I clicked something that said, currently utilizing education benefits or not, but I know that I did click certain things that are corresponding with education benefits, so that's actually what brought me to see the one to apply, because I've never seen this before.  
283  
00:30:23.070 \--\> 00:30:26.189  
P5: Like, I was never made aware of Chapter 36\.  
284  
00:30:27.030 \--\> 00:30:32.309  
P5: Although I was also coming out of the military with a bunch of college credits as well, so I didn't…  
285  
00:30:32.760 \--\> 00:30:36.409  
P5: Necessce- this wasn't anything necessarily on my radar.  
286  
00:30:38.950 \--\> 00:30:46.089  
Moderator: So is there… is there anything that I haven't asked about yet, that you think that we should know about how this works?  
287  
00:30:47.000 \--\> 00:30:53.449  
P5: Let's see here, let's go ahead and do a… okay, you can go back and update your answers. Oh\!  
288  
00:30:53.640 \--\> 00:31:02.010  
P5: Benefits for… we can help you guide as you transition from active duty service or from service in the National Guard. Some benefits are only available when you're still serving.  
289  
00:31:03.240 \--\> 00:31:06.380  
P5: I'm gonna go ahead and click this. This is actually kind of interesting.  
290  
00:31:10.900 \--\> 00:31:13.370  
P5: Okay, that actually took me to the VA page.  
291  
00:31:19.200 \--\> 00:31:20.100  
P5: Okay.  
292  
00:31:21.150 \--\> 00:31:24.079  
P5: Ability… yep, VA-backed home loan, cool.  
293  
00:31:28.980 \--\> 00:31:31.449  
P5: Okay, cool, alright, that makes sense.  
294  
00:31:31.960 \--\> 00:31:32.740  
P5: Good.  
295  
00:31:33.940 \--\> 00:31:39.840  
P5: Alright… I think that we pretty much hit everything. We…  
296  
00:31:40.970 \--\> 00:31:45.970  
P5: Yeah, and then, of course, you guys got all the stuff at the, oh, this is cool, I like that.  
297  
00:31:48.300 \--\> 00:31:50.919  
P5: contact a local VSO. I like those.  
298  
00:31:51.130 \--\> 00:31:52.740  
Moderator: Have you worked with a VSO?  
299  
00:31:52.830 \--\> 00:32:02.219  
P5: Well, and I know you said that when you were doing your medical separation, you worked with an agent, but, like, as a veteran since then, have you worked with VSO?  
300  
00:32:03.960 \--\> 00:32:06.920  
P5: Not in the context for…  
301  
00:32:07.380 \--\> 00:32:21.920  
P5: services. Like, I didn't use a VSO or anything like that when I was, trying to get my disability rating up. The closest thing that I use… that I've come to… come to using a VSO is I applied for a job…  
302  
00:32:22.170 \--\> 00:32:27.280  
P5: I don't know if they're necessarily a VSO, or if they're just kind of a national organization, but  
303  
00:32:27.450 \--\> 00:32:35.400  
P5: I applied for a job with, the…  
304  
00:32:36.720 \--\> 00:32:38.839  
P5: I think it was a VFW.  
305  
00:32:39.850 \--\> 00:32:40.999  
Moderator: They're a VSO, yeah.  
306  
00:32:41.000 \--\> 00:32:52.359  
P5: Yeah, okay, yeah, so I've… I mean, like, that was the most… that was the true most interaction that I've had with the VSO, because I applied for a job with them, and I was interviewed by them, so… but that's another little tangent.  
307  
00:32:54.350 \--\> 00:33:02.420  
Moderator: All right, so, I have a few questions, to wrap this up. Absolutely.  
308  
00:33:02.860 \--\> 00:33:06.019  
Moderator: So, is this tool helpful for you in your life today?  
309  
00:33:06.060 \--\> 00:33:27.260  
P5: like, this little tool that gives me information. I would say certain aspects of it are… of it are yes. Like, specifically, like I said previously, the fact that my wife and I are gonna possibly try and utilize my VA home loan soon, because I… because I have access to it, I may try and do… I may want to come and look at some more information, because I know that…  
310  
00:33:27.690 \--\> 00:33:41.619  
P5: I need to learn more about it before I try and utilize it, so we'll probably come on this website together. And then, of course, some of it is just… I already have a general information, I already have, like, a general knowledge about it. Like, I have general knowledge about  
311  
00:33:41.620 \--\> 00:33:50.339  
P5: the GI Bill, and things like that, and there are certain things, like the education and career counseling benefits, I'm just not eligible for anymore.  
312  
00:33:50.340 \--\> 00:33:51.820  
Moderator: So I just know that…  
313  
00:33:51.890 \--\> 00:34:05.440  
P5: certain things like that, maybe I'll look into in case I know of a friend who's gonna be getting out, and I want to tell them, hey, I wasn't… I didn't do this, but let's go ahead and make sure that you know about this.  
314  
00:34:05.590 \--\> 00:34:09.820  
P5: So, like, I might do it as, like, kind of a friend to help someone, but that's about it.  
315  
00:34:10.320 \--\> 00:34:22.879  
Moderator: Cool. Yeah, and I just put a link in the chat to the live version of this tool. You know, this is the Codespaces prototype, but there's already a version of this, so you can return and look at.  
316  
00:34:23.800 \--\> 00:34:24.250  
P5: Okay, cool.  
317  
00:34:24.250 \--\> 00:34:29.610  
Moderator: Yeah, look, find your way back to the home loan benefit and anything else you're interested in.  
318  
00:34:29.620 \--\> 00:34:31.460  
P5: Yeah, okay, cool, I'm gonna definitely keep that open.  
319  
00:34:32.090 \--\> 00:34:40.100  
Moderator: Great. So, scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate this tool? Your satisfaction, the quality of your experience?  
320  
00:34:40.100 \--\> 00:34:41.560  
P5: Oh, without a doubt, a 5\.  
321  
00:34:42.000 \--\> 00:34:44.270  
Moderator: Very easy to use.  
322  
00:34:44.270 \--\> 00:35:03.160  
P5: very user-friendly. I like the fact that it has multiple things that you can use to filter out certain things, especially the show only results recommended for you. That's definitely really, really helpful. And then, of course, like, the benefits types. It seems like you guys put a lot of thought and consideration into some of the different,  
323  
00:35:03.160 \--\> 00:35:17.140  
P5: benefits that you guys are putting on there, so I think that it definitely makes it very, very user-friendly, especially for individuals who may not have a lot of technological prowess or anything along those lines, but they want to try and understand certain things.  
324  
00:35:18.130 \--\> 00:35:24.789  
Moderator: Oh… Are there any types of benefits that you… that are missing that you'd like to see?  
325  
00:35:24.790 \--\> 00:35:26.310  
P5: Let's see here…  
326  
00:35:32.310 \--\> 00:35:40.199  
P5: I'm gonna apply housing assistance really quick, just because I wanna see personally what pops up.  
327  
00:35:41.100 \--\> 00:35:41.800  
Moderator: Great.  
328  
00:35:41.800 \--\> 00:35:56.869  
P5: Disability Housing Grant, VA backed… Okay, that's what I thought. Whoops, I don't know why it keeps doing that. I would say… the reason why I did that one is I wanted to see what popped up. I think what you guys… or what the VA could do is…  
329  
00:35:57.120 \--\> 00:36:00.649  
P5: Maybe adding benefit of, like,  
330  
00:36:01.860 \--\> 00:36:06.549  
P5: A displaced veteran, or displaced veteran and family.  
331  
00:36:06.550 \--\> 00:36:09.030  
Moderator: Something along those lines, because…  
332  
00:36:09.370 \--\> 00:36:25.030  
P5: Unfortunately, the veteran population is one of the faster-growing homeless populations, especially as the Department of Defense sees a massive influx of individuals leaving the United States Armed Forces, for whatever reason that is. I'm not gonna get into that, but…  
333  
00:36:25.590 \--\> 00:36:44.679  
P5: I think that it is important to have a section specifically set aside for that. And then, of course, that can dive deeper into a discussion that we had about, like, oh, maybe it was someone who was only separated after 3 years, 30 days of service, and they're really, really hesitant about wanting to use veteran benefits, like…  
334  
00:36:44.680 \--\> 00:37:00.589  
P5: that's something that you definitely might want to make sure that they're aware of, because we don't know if they're gonna have any assistance if they go back home or go back to wherever. So I would say that would be something to add. Maybe you could do it under housing assistance, or you could do…  
335  
00:37:01.030 \--\> 00:37:07.859  
P5: I would almost… personally, I would shy away from using the term homeless veteran.  
336  
00:37:08.990 \--\> 00:37:13.019  
P5: I would say maybe displaced, or,  
337  
00:37:13.790 \--\> 00:37:20.510  
P5: something along those lines, just because I know that homelessness can have a negative connotation, and some people may have…  
338  
00:37:20.740 \--\> 00:37:24.429  
P5: Not necessarily issues identifying themselves as homeless, but…  
339  
00:37:24.750 \--\> 00:37:35.380  
P5: They have appre- like a… They have certain… hesitancies, I suppose.  
340  
00:37:35.620 \--\> 00:37:37.269  
P5: Of using that word.  
341  
00:37:37.270 \--\> 00:37:41.119  
Moderator: Yeah, VA generally uses unhoused.  
342  
00:37:41.330 \--\> 00:37:42.879  
P5: Okay, yeah, that makes sense.  
343  
00:37:43.040 \--\> 00:37:45.830  
Moderator: Yeah, does that… does that hit the right note for you?  
344  
00:37:45.830 \--\> 00:37:51.640  
P5: I would say it does, yeah, because it's definitely softer than…  
345  
00:37:52.920 \--\> 00:38:02.269  
P5: Homeless, and it's… but there's not gonna be any miscon… there's not gonna be any misconstruction of what's meant, because there could be the misconstruction of a…  
346  
00:38:03.600 \--\> 00:38:08.149  
P5: Oh man, I'm so sorry, I just completely blanked on the word that I used for some reason, but  
347  
00:38:08.860 \--\> 00:38:27.019  
P5: Displaced, you said? Displaced, thank you. Thank you very much. I don't know why I could not think of that word for some reason. That could produce a different meaning to somebody else entirely, so that's something that we want to try and avoid, or I know that the VA wants to avoid trying to use any language that may or may not be clear.  
348  
00:38:28.280 \--\> 00:38:35.259  
Moderator: So, it sounds like you think that a missing benefit type here is,  
349  
00:38:35.670 \--\> 00:38:45.839  
Moderator: generally, services for someone who might be in crisis, so… Yeah. Yeah, that could… that could be being unhoused, or, you know, having unstable housing. That could be, experiencing.  
350  
00:38:45.840 \--\> 00:38:46.770  
P5: mental health.  
351  
00:38:46.770 \--\> 00:38:49.159  
Moderator: mental health emergency, so…  
352  
00:38:49.160 \--\> 00:38:49.900  
P5: was…  
353  
00:38:50.130 \--\> 00:38:56.739  
Moderator: You think maybe that if someone who was in crisis, or needed urgent help came to this.  
354  
00:38:57.180 \--\> 00:39:01.260  
Moderator: came to this tool, do you think that they would feel like it was for them?  
355  
00:39:01.620 \--\> 00:39:03.540  
P5: I think so, yes.  
356  
00:39:03.860 \--\> 00:39:06.410  
P5: I think so, on a few…  
357  
00:39:06.790 \--\> 00:39:09.100  
P5: Based on a few different,  
358  
00:39:09.220 \--\> 00:39:13.690  
P5: Reasonings, number one of which is… veterans…  
359  
00:39:14.210 \--\> 00:39:20.629  
P5: a lot of the veterans that I know, I'm not gonna say all veterans, but a lot of the veterans that I know have been… have become more…  
360  
00:39:22.140 \--\> 00:39:29.139  
P5: self… I have become more self-aware and understanding that if they need assistance.  
361  
00:39:29.380 \--\> 00:39:33.460  
P5: the VA is there to help them. As…  
362  
00:39:33.690 \--\> 00:39:47.110  
P5: as much as they may have reservations about it, the VA is definitely there. It's… we earned these benefits regardless of how long you did, whether it was 4 years, 4 months, 20 years, 20 months, so on, so forth.  
363  
00:39:48.440 \--\> 00:39:51.370  
P5: And I think that if people are in dire straits enough.  
364  
00:39:52.190 \--\> 00:39:59.009  
P5: it would definitely be beneficial, because I will tell a personal story really quick. I…  
365  
00:39:59.210 \--\> 00:40:07.369  
P5: have suffered from mental health problems for a long time. It started when I was in this… it was started when I was in service, but it…  
366  
00:40:07.600 \--\> 00:40:11.370  
P5: Has, persisted for an extremely long time.  
367  
00:40:12.570 \--\> 00:40:16.149  
P5: I have looked up the number for the veterans  
368  
00:40:16.750 \--\> 00:40:31.699  
P5: Suicide crisis hotline, and it took me directly to the VA's website. I didn't call. I thankfully, was… I kind of used techniques that I had learned prior to… prior to that instance when I was with a psychologist through the VA, but…  
369  
00:40:32.160 \--\> 00:40:36.869  
P5: I personally understand and know that sometimes when veterans do need help.  
370  
00:40:38.920 \--\> 00:40:42.830  
P5: Our first instinct is to try and go back to  
371  
00:40:43.200 \--\> 00:40:45.810  
P5: A source that we've been told is there to help us.  
372  
00:40:49.800 \--\> 00:40:52.650  
Moderator: So you think,  
373  
00:40:54.310 \--\> 00:41:02.519  
Moderator: Do you think that this fits into that, or is there anything we could do to make it work better for somebody who might be in crisis?  
374  
00:41:03.210 \--\> 00:41:08.180  
P5: I think that… sorry, my laptop was about to die. I think that…  
375  
00:41:09.500 \--\> 00:41:21.159  
P5: Hmm. I think that maybe something that you all could do is… I don't know how… well, actually, here, let me do this. I'm gonna do this really quick, just because I wanna see if there's an easy way to…  
376  
00:41:21.940 \--\> 00:41:26.399  
P5: Okay, so let's say I'm in… I'm gonna do a little bit of a situation here.  
377  
00:41:26.560 \--\> 00:41:30.459  
P5: I need help with something, and I need services completed.  
378  
00:41:30.960 \--\> 00:41:37.660  
P5: I think that if I go to the VA website, let's see here… maybe what you guys could do is…  
379  
00:41:37.850 \--\> 00:41:41.930  
P5: I like that you guys have that put right there. That's just a good thing on the VA, I like that.  
380  
00:41:42.910 \--\> 00:41:48.379  
P5: I think that… Maybe what you guys could do is something along the lines of…  
381  
00:41:50.340 \--\> 00:41:55.330  
P5: Do something like a survey of benefits, or a survey of what you need.  
382  
00:41:55.720 \--\> 00:41:59.959  
P5: Or maybe doing a, are you a veteran in crisis? Click here.  
383  
00:42:01.070 \--\> 00:42:02.600  
P5: Kind of like the,  
384  
00:42:03.260 \--\> 00:42:09.639  
P5: kind of like what certain areas of the VA will do for when it comes to mental health crises, crises.  
385  
00:42:10.250 \--\> 00:42:16.920  
P5: You could do something similar to that, and be… and just explain after the individual clicks the link, like.  
386  
00:42:17.590 \--\> 00:42:22.750  
P5: These are different resources that we provide. If you need mental health support, please  
387  
00:42:23.150 \--\> 00:42:27.840  
P5: Click here if you need housing support, click here, and we can…  
388  
00:42:28.080 \--\> 00:42:42.970  
P5: And we can have you type in your zip code to see if there… where the nearest VA hospital is, or where the nearest area is that will allow veterans who are currently in crisis for housing issues to come and stay.  
389  
00:42:44.730 \--\> 00:42:51.510  
P5: And then you can do whatever other crises may be prominent within veterans' lives. Like, I know that,  
390  
00:42:52.290 \--\> 00:43:03.330  
P5: sometimes one of the things that used to happen to me a little bit when I was using my original Montgom… not my Montgomery… my post-9-11 when I was at the University of Virginia was,  
391  
00:43:03.470 \--\> 00:43:17.439  
P5: sometimes if I was, like, frantically trying to figure out where my… where my housing allowance was because I haven't received it yet, sometimes I would click on the wrong thing, and then I wouldn't be able to find it, and then I got even more freaked out, so…  
392  
00:43:18.440 \--\> 00:43:31.460  
P5: I know that sometimes, especially when the VA is… a source… is one of the only sources of payment for an individual, money can become a very, very important thing for these individuals.  
393  
00:43:35.330 \--\> 00:43:38.889  
Moderator: That's great insights, thank you.  
394  
00:43:39.410 \--\> 00:43:50.930  
Moderator: Yeah, I really appreciate everything you've shared. I know we're a couple minutes after 1.15, but do you have a minute to talk about how you're using AI?  
395  
00:43:51.200 \--\> 00:43:52.599  
P5: Oh, yeah, no, absolutely.  
396  
00:43:52.820 \--\> 00:43:58.480  
Moderator: Great. So, I noticed… yeah, so you're using Comet Browser.  
397  
00:43:59.100 \--\> 00:44:11.849  
Moderator: And I'm assuming, because you're using Comet Browser and Perplexity, that you're… that you're using AI to interact with a lot of different online services. So,  
398  
00:44:12.380 \--\> 00:44:17.999  
Moderator: Can you tell me, like, have you used any of those tools with VA.gov?  
399  
00:44:18.280 \--\> 00:44:32.419  
P5: No, I have not. A lot of what I use AI for is kind of generalized, like, if I'm thinking of something, a lot of it has to do with, like, just if I have a thought that pops into my head and I want to try and remember something, like, a lot of it is…  
400  
00:44:33.660 \--\> 00:44:45.049  
P5: A majority of it's honestly gonna be, like, dinner options or, like, cooking things that I just wanna try and know and understand. Like, I'll… I'll commonly use it for a lot of stuff like that, and then, like,  
401  
00:44:45.280 \--\> 00:44:54.219  
P5: But I can't say that I've used it for the VA. I didn't even know that there would be an option for that, like, I mean, outside of just kind of doing a general Google search.  
402  
00:44:54.380 \--\> 00:44:58.760  
P5: of, like, and then using the Gemini results.  
403  
00:44:59.630 \--\> 00:45:02.310  
Moderator: Got it. Okay, so,  
404  
00:45:04.970 \--\> 00:45:15.599  
Moderator: It sounds like you're not doing some of the, agent-based, you know, form filling or anything like that that I've heard some people talk about doing.  
405  
00:45:15.600 \--\> 00:45:16.320  
P5: No.  
406  
00:45:16.960 \--\> 00:45:18.939  
Moderator: Okay, got it.  
407  
00:45:22.120 \--\> 00:45:32.740  
Moderator: Have you noticed anything unexpected, like, using VA.gov with Comet versus, like, more traditional browsers, like Chrome or Firefox or Safari?  
408  
00:45:32.990 \--\> 00:45:37.139  
P5: I… I don't know why, but I've noticed that it runs a little bit quicker.  
409  
00:45:37.140 \--\> 00:45:38.380  
Moderator: That's good.  
410  
00:45:38.380 \--\> 00:45:43.630  
P5: Yeah, no, I, because I do the two-factor authentication with my text messaging.  
411  
00:45:43.830 \--\> 00:45:48.370  
P5: I, it takes me, probably, if I had to guess.  
412  
00:45:48.630 \--\> 00:45:52.970  
P5: like, maybe 5 to 10 seconds quicker on Comet versus Chrome.  
413  
00:45:53.250 \--\> 00:46:04.780  
P5: I mean, granted, I don't know if that's also maybe my internet connection got better. I… I could… that could be the… that could have been the issue, but personally, I've been using Comet nonstop ever since I downloaded it.  
414  
00:46:04.890 \--\> 00:46:08.419  
P5: Which would have been when it was released to the general public.  
415  
00:46:09.240 \--\> 00:46:12.180  
P5: I think, like, in October? Maybe September?  
416  
00:46:12.590 \--\> 00:46:16.689  
P5: I don't remember when it was released, but I've been using it nonstop ever since then.  
417  
00:46:16.880 \--\> 00:46:18.689  
Moderator: And I've noticed that…  
418  
00:46:18.690 \--\> 00:46:27.599  
P5: if for some reason I go on to VA.gov, like, I use the, like, I use the Chrome app on my phone, and if I need to go on to a VA.gov  
419  
00:46:28.390 \--\> 00:46:31.009  
P5: Like, to log in for whatever reason.  
420  
00:46:31.200 \--\> 00:46:41.000  
P5: because I, like, let's say that I didn't have the app, but I wanted to get on my VA account. I've noticed that it runs slower on Chrome versus Comet.  
421  
00:46:42.500 \--\> 00:46:48.719  
Moderator: And does Comet automate the two-factor authentication by integrating with your phone?  
422  
00:46:49.050 \--\> 00:46:57.579  
P5: No, so I still have to automatically choose to have the two-factor authentication be my, be… send a text message to my phone.  
423  
00:46:57.580 \--\> 00:47:01.670  
Moderator: Got it. But I know that there is… I don't know how to do it.  
424  
00:47:01.720 \--\> 00:47:05.340  
P5: but I have read that there is a way where you can actually do it  
425  
00:47:05.760 \--\> 00:47:16.720  
P5: automatically, like, I'm pretty sure that there's, like, something that has to be done on, like, the… on the owner of the portal. So, like, the actual people that run the VA website.  
426  
00:47:17.190 \--\> 00:47:23.930  
P5: like, there would have to be confirmation in between you guys and then, the comment people. I…  
427  
00:47:24.480 \--\> 00:47:35.159  
P5: Words are hard right now. Basically, to allow us to just have a… automatically have a text code sent, so that way there's, like, not the need for clicking, like, yes, please send me a text message.  
428  
00:47:35.600 \--\> 00:47:36.380  
Moderator: Got it.  
429  
00:47:38.190 \--\> 00:47:44.450  
Moderator: Yep, so that's… All my questions. Awesome. Do you have any questions for me?  
430  
00:47:44.820 \--\> 00:47:46.390  
P5: No? I can't think of anything.  
431  
00:47:46.460 \--\> 00:47:59.929  
Moderator: Yeah, I… I appreciate you taking the time so much to… Yeah, of course. …to give… to give feedback on this. Let me just check in my notes and make sure that we are,  
432  
00:48:00.920 \--\> 00:48:03.870  
Moderator: Yep, gotten everything.  
433  
00:48:03.870 \--\> 00:48:05.770  
P5: Go ahead and stop sharing my screen really quick.  
434  
00:48:05.770 \--\> 00:48:09.779  
Moderator: Okay, great. You know, I do have one last question,  
435  
00:48:10.550 \--\> 00:48:24.890  
Moderator: Is there anything that we didn't talk about that you think VA should know about your experience getting benefits after transitioning? Because I know you talked about the medical separation process, which is really important. Besides that, is there anything that you think we should know?  
436  
00:48:27.130 \--\> 00:48:29.560  
P5: I would say…  
437  
00:48:32.970 \--\> 00:48:41.809  
P5: Yes. I'm trying to think of how to word this, because a lot of the issues that I had when I got out were not with the VA. They were with the OD, they were with my home base.  
438  
00:48:41.810 \--\> 00:48:42.460  
Moderator: Yep.  
439  
00:48:43.130 \--\> 00:48:48.920  
P5: For lack of better words, and I'm sorry for this language offense, you guys, I got fucked. I got fucked very, very hard.  
440  
00:48:49.050 \--\> 00:49:01.589  
P5: Because I was in for about 5 extra months than I was supposed to be, which in turn caused me to have to take out student loans, because I was not able to immediately start utilizing my GI Bill.  
441  
00:49:01.930 \--\> 00:49:02.460  
Moderator: Got it.  
442  
00:49:02.460 \--\> 00:49:07.509  
P5: And I'm not eligible to get them, forgiven because they are through  
443  
00:49:08.070 \--\> 00:49:11.999  
P5: Because the one that I pulled out originally is through Navy Federal.  
444  
00:49:13.630 \--\> 00:49:15.309  
Moderator: No, it's… it's private, it's not…  
445  
00:49:15.310 \--\> 00:49:18.179  
P5: It's private, it's not public. Yeah, so…  
446  
00:49:18.290 \--\> 00:49:27.150  
P5: I will say that when I was doing things through the VA, because a lot of the things that I had to do once I got out were a lot of…  
447  
00:49:27.910 \--\> 00:49:29.399  
P5: administrative things.  
448  
00:49:29.840 \--\> 00:49:43.669  
P5: A lot of it was very straightforward. I'm gonna sing the BA's praises for… for a moment. Applying for my post-9-11 versus my, like, switching it from Montgomery to post-9-11? Super easy. 100%.  
449  
00:49:43.890 \--\> 00:49:46.269  
P5: A toddler could have done it, for lack of better words.  
450  
00:49:47.190 \--\> 00:49:52.219  
P5: Understanding how to… and what paperwork you need to fill out for…  
451  
00:49:52.850 \--\> 00:50:08.709  
P5: trying to expand upon disability benefits. Super easy, super simple, and provides offices around you that'll be able to help you as well. Again, super great. One of the things that I did have trouble with when I got out was, again, this isn't something that you guys could have done differently.  
452  
00:50:10.600 \--\> 00:50:16.419  
P5: was… because I was medically separated and not medically retired, I received a severance payment.  
453  
00:50:17.730 \--\> 00:50:21.770  
P5: That severance took almost 6 months for me to receive it.  
454  
00:50:23.320 \--\> 00:50:24.330  
Moderator: Ouch.  
455  
00:50:24.480 \--\> 00:50:29.680  
P5: And it was not a low amount of severance either. It was close to $40,000.  
456  
00:50:30.010 \--\> 00:50:35.190  
P5: Which… When we finally did get it, it helped.  
457  
00:50:35.750 \--\> 00:50:39.950  
P5: But, again, that's nothing that the VA could have done differently.  
458  
00:50:40.750 \--\> 00:50:47.119  
P5: there was a small issue that I had when I got out with receiving my initial…  
459  
00:50:48.090 \--\> 00:50:51.399  
P5: Payment for disability.  
460  
00:50:52.390 \--\> 00:51:01.730  
P5: it just took a little bit longer than I anticipated, but every time that I called to try and gauge about it, the individual that I spoke with would always constantly  
461  
00:51:02.610 \--\> 00:51:21.129  
P5: tell me, you know what, we're gonna put this note in your file showing that you called, we're gonna get this… we're gonna get this figured out together, we're gonna get this fixed for you. Especially because I was still waiting for my severance payment at that time. So, I will say that it was a very small issue. Again, nothing that really could have been changed, but it was very helpful.  
462  
00:51:21.660 \--\> 00:51:27.310  
P5: And then one thing that I always try to…  
463  
00:51:27.490 \--\> 00:51:30.809  
P5: make sure that I want the VA to understand is…  
464  
00:51:37.380 \--\> 00:51:38.960  
P5: When it comes to mental health.  
465  
00:51:40.350 \--\> 00:51:47.630  
P5: I've never had this issue, but I have talked to other veterans who have been cast aside by individuals at emergency rooms at VA hospitals.  
466  
00:51:50.670 \--\> 00:51:57.720  
P5: Just because someone isn't walking in on a false flag, or they don't have an arm.  
467  
00:51:58.180 \--\> 00:51:59.950  
P5: Doesn't mean that they're not hurting.  
468  
00:52:00.630 \--\> 00:52:01.120  
Moderator: Yep.  
469  
00:52:01.120 \--\> 00:52:03.410  
P5: I just want the VA to understand that.  
470  
00:52:03.820 \--\> 00:52:07.570  
P5: and I want… There to be accountability.  
471  
00:52:08.160 \--\> 00:52:15.340  
P5: On individuals who do… Make veterans feel as though They're not.  
472  
00:52:16.610 \--\> 00:52:17.520  
P5: hurting.  
473  
00:52:19.550 \--\> 00:52:20.840  
P5: That's all that I gotta say.  
474  
00:52:21.100 \--\> 00:52:39.089  
Moderator: Yeah, absolutely. You know, thank you for sharing that, and thank you for sharing that so forcefully. I have a veteran in my family who has had a similar experience related to that, and it's, yeah, it's life-altering, and yeah, thanks for sharing that.  
475  
00:52:39.400 \--\> 00:52:44.979  
P5: Yeah, of course, I… I've lost numerous friends when I was in the military to suicide. I…  
476  
00:52:45.240 \--\> 00:52:48.509  
P5: At numerous points, was considering suicide myself.  
477  
00:52:48.870 \--\> 00:52:51.239  
P5: And my drinking got very out of control.  
478  
00:52:51.470 \--\> 00:52:57.510  
P5: That also… Played a little bit of a role in it, but… I…  
479  
00:52:59.970 \--\> 00:53:03.129  
P5: while I do not agree with the current administration on a lot of things.  
480  
00:53:03.480 \--\> 00:53:07.490  
P5: Especially the politicization of the DOD and the VA.  
481  
00:53:09.830 \--\> 00:53:14.389  
P5: I'm still grateful that the VA is here, and I'm always gonna be grateful that the VA is here.  
482  
00:53:14.940 \--\> 00:53:17.359  
P5: Whether or not we make jokes.  
483  
00:53:18.080 \--\> 00:53:23.840  
P5: because we can always all make jokes, like, yeah, the VAs… the VA did this, the VA did that, like…  
484  
00:53:24.160 \--\> 00:53:33.919  
P5: A lot of times, it's in good faith, and it's in good humor. We're not actively distrustful or hitting the VA. I thoroughly have never had a bad experience at a VA.  
485  
00:53:34.060 \--\> 00:53:38.200  
P5: But I know others should have, and that's why I said that earlier, but…  
486  
00:53:38.200 \--\> 00:53:38.620  
Moderator: Yeah.  
487  
00:53:38.620 \--\> 00:53:41.620  
P5: If there was another thing that I had to say, it would just be…  
488  
00:53:41.870 \--\> 00:53:46.910  
P5: Please, and if you guys want to share this with anybody that you can, please do it.  
489  
00:53:47.190 \--\> 00:53:49.850  
P5: Please keep the VA apolitical.  
490  
00:53:50.380 \--\> 00:53:53.070  
P5: We don't want to be used as…  
491  
00:53:55.710 \--\> 00:54:02.179  
P5: We don't want to be used as agents in a game of chess when it comes to political warfare.  
492  
00:54:03.350 \--\> 00:54:07.339  
P5: that's the last thing that any of us want. Like, I want…  
493  
00:54:07.890 \--\> 00:54:26.699  
P5: I want to know that the VA is there for my benefit. I want to know that it's going to be there for my wife's benefit when she gets out of the military, whenever that may be. That it's going to be there for my friend's benefits when they decide to get out or when they decide to retire. I don't want there to not be a VA, or there to be a VA that's extremely limited with what they can do because of political reasoning.  
494  
00:54:28.190 \--\> 00:54:31.750  
P5: And I think that anybody who's gone through the VA will agree with that.  
495  
00:54:33.430 \--\> 00:54:36.270  
Moderator: Yeah, active.  
496  
00:54:36.580 \--\> 00:54:38.170  
Moderator: Could not agree more.  
497  
00:54:40.020 \--\> 00:54:41.770  
P5: Excuse me.  
498  
00:54:41.770 \--\> 00:54:43.830  
Moderator: Yeah, thank you for sharing all of that.  
499  
00:54:43.830 \--\> 00:54:44.920  
P5: Yeah, of course. I'm…  
500  
00:54:45.260 \--\> 00:54:55.199  
Moderator: I really appreciate your perspective on everything. Like, you've given us some really great insights, and, you know, just to especially thank you for your honesty.  
501  
00:54:55.200 \--\> 00:54:57.090  
P5: Yeah, of course, I figure…  
502  
00:54:57.520 \--\> 00:55:07.799  
P5: If there are things that I saw that needed to be changed, I told you guys. If there are things that I liked, I told you guys for sure. And then, of course, I gave my own personal opinion on certain things that…  
503  
00:55:08.150 \--\> 00:55:18.169  
P5: weren't necessarily asked, but I wanted to bring up nonetheless. And I thank you guys for the opportunity to bring up my… the opportunity for me to speak about it. I do appreciate it.  
504  
00:55:18.630 \--\> 00:55:20.410  
Moderator: Yeah,  
505  
00:55:20.990 \--\> 00:55:27.270  
Moderator: And thank you again. I want to circle back, reconfirm, are you comfortable if we share a video clip of this session?  
506  
00:55:27.270 \--\> 00:55:28.970  
P5: Absolutely, 100%.  
507  
00:55:28.970 \--\> 00:55:32.600  
Moderator: Yeah, and that's without identifying information, of course.  
508  
00:55:32.600 \--\> 00:55:33.900  
P5: Yeah, no, absolutely.  
509  
00:55:33.900 \--\> 00:55:54.519  
Moderator: Yeah, okay, so, we're done. I really appreciate you taking the time, I appreciate your candor, I appreciate your feedback. You're going to be getting a thank you note from Paragian with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans who you may know to provide them the chance to participate. And, thank you so much, enjoy the rest of your day. Take care.  
510  
00:55:54.520 \--\> 00:55:55.560  
P5: We're thinking, guys.  
511  
00:55:55.680 \--\> 00:55:56.480  
Moderator: Bye\!  
512  
00:55:56.670 \--\> 00:55:57.240  
P5: Bye.
