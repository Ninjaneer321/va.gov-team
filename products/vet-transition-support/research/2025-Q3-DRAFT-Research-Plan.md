# Pre-Decisional Research Plan Draft
This research plan draft describes the objectives, methodologies, and research questions for upcoming research conducted by the Veteran Transition Experience product team. 

# Research objectives

1. Understand how to support TSMs’ need to keep track of their transition progress, deadlines, and tasks to reduce stress, minimize the possibility of missing deadlines, and improve transition outcomes. This objective includes learning what they are currently doing to manage this need. This research builds on earlier studies which created a body of knowledge about general needs of TSMs to track progress, honing in on how digital services might serve their needs, and how the way they use technology may have changed with widespread adoption of LLM tools like ChatGPT. 
2. Understand how to improve the tool to address TSMs’ unmet needs of support to take action and get help. Urgent support is out of scope for this study and may be addressed in an upcoming study.   
3. Usability testing of the product in staging, including Guard and Reserve features.
   
# Methodologies

## This research \- Q3 usability study

* Semi-structured interviews  
* Usability test of the product in staging

## Next research \- Q4 study

* Fast follow-on research with prototypes to address findings from Q3 study  

# Research priorities: Addressing unmet user needs

| Unmet user need/Insight | Details | Questions: TSMs | Questions: TAP |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Several transitioning service members expressed a desire for a progress monitor, task tracker, or checklist to help with their military-to-civilian transition. | In user testing for Version 2 of the Veteran Transition Support product, half of the participants (6 out of 12\) stated they wanted a way to track upcoming transition-related tasks. Four of these participants specifically mentioned wanting a progress monitor or an indicator of how much time they have to apply for a benefit. Two participants suggested a checklist feature to keep track of outstanding tasks, the application process for time-sensitive benefits, and the necessary documentation. "If there's an app or a website where you log in, use the tool, and then get reminders about when it’s time to start thinking about different benefits, \[that would be helpful\].  "A few months out, getting reminders or having a checklist to know what's coming up. It could be a dropdown on the \[tool\] to show which tasks are still outstanding." and  "The army will move you one last time, but when do you have to do that by, and what’s the timeline?". | What are you doing right now to keep track of your progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? Tools Actions People ? Outside of TAP, is anyone helping you keep track of what you need for your transition? What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during your transition?  | What do you see TAP participants currently using to keep track of progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation? Tools Actions People What tools do you recommend TAP participants use? What are you most concerned might slip through the cracks during transition?  |
| Users wanted the ability to ask for help while exploring or applying for benefits, suggesting live agents, chatbots, or referrals to in-person help centers. |  | What support would you like to receive that isn’t included in this tool? | What support would you like to see TAP participants receive that isn’t included in this tool? How could this tool make your job easier? |
| There was a strong desire for the tool to help users take action (e.g., starting a benefit application) rather than just providing information. |  | After using this tool, what would you do next? What would help you take action?  |  |

# Unmet Needs that are outside the scope of Q3 research

As we crafted this research plan we identified areas from unmet needs that were critical to the product but given the need to scope our study and the pursue the parallel path of pilot-readiness these items are out of scope both for active exploration in the study *and* development ahead of the pilot. Anna will be listening for queues that relate to these items but she will not be directly pursuing information on them.

| Outside pilot scope and/or low priority |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
|  **Insight/Unmet Need** | **Reason to deprioritize for Q3 study** | **Reason to deprioritize for Pilot** |
| Some participants desired integration with their authenticated VA.gov profiles for pre-populating questionnaires and seeing open claims or previously awarded benefits. | Out of scope per pilot plan | Out of scope per pilot plan |
| Participants wanted to learn about lesser-known benefits (e.g., travel reimbursement, retiree ID cards, property tax breaks, park passes) alongside more popular ones like healthcare and disability compensation. | We are not adding benefits before the pilot | We are not adding benefits before the pilot |
| Reservists specifically held misconceptions about their eligibility for benefits and expressed guilt in using them. | Already addressed in development |  |
| It's important to be cognizant of the needs of senior Veterans. | TSMs aren’t seniors | TSMs aren’t seniors |
| Mental health support is a useful consideration as part of the tool. | Included in banner on VA.gov | Outside of scope |

# Recruitment

## TSMs

* Service characteristics  
  * Branch  
  * Active Duty, Guard and Reserve  
  * Length of service  
  * Rank
* Demographic characteristics  
  * Gender  
  * Age - High priority recruitment criteria so we understand the needs of TSMs who separate at different life stages 
  * Race and ethnicity
