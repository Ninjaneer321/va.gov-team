	# Research Plan for Veteran Transition Experience, Discover Your Benefits tool, July 2025

## Background üèóÔ∏è
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

Transitioning Servicemembers (TSMs) and Recently Separated Veterans (RSVs) are particularly overwhelmed by the transition process. The entire process, from planning, to separation, to adjustment to civilian life can occur over the course of several years. The change to routines and circumstances are a major change and during that time there is an increased risk of creating vulnerable populations. In addition to juggling personal challenges, TSMs and RSVs have no easy way to find the range of benefits which they are eligible for.
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

The current product is an [unauthenticated questionnaire](https://www.va.gov/discover-your-benefits/introduction) hosted on VA.gov and is publicly accessible.
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

### [OCTO-DE Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202025.md) 

`Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

`Objective 2: OCTO‚Äôs platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

> - **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of VA employees have access to a valuable Generative AI tool to help with their work.
> - **Key Result 4:** Each of our platforms* and tools increase the number of non-OCTO built capabilities or non-OCTO users by 50%. (*excluding mobile)

## Research Goals ü•Ö	

1. Understand how to support TSMs‚Äô need to keep track of their transition progress/deadlines/tasks/to do list to reduce stress, minimize the possibility of missing deadlines, and improve transition outcomes.  
2. Understand how to improve the tool to address TSMs‚Äô unmet needs of support to take action and get help  
3. Usability testing of the product in staging
 
### Outcome

We will use the insights from the generative portion of this research as a foundation for designing a component of the product to help TSMs track their progress and deadlines in transitioning from active service to Veteran, with a goal of maximizing benefit discovery and timely applications for benefits they are eligible for serve their goals. 

We will use the usability testing portion of the study to improve experience of the features we have added to the product since the last study, which was conducted in December 2024.

### Research questions
> [!NOTE]
> Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the` [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)

1. * What are TSMs currently doing to track progress, tasks, and deadlines for separation?  
  * Tools  
  * Actions  
2. What current sources of support are TSMs using?
  * People
  * Organizations
  * Other forms of support that we have not anticipated
3. * Building on existing research about experiences in the 'getting out' part of the Veteran journey, what pain points are TSMs experiencing? 

### Hypotheses

Our hypothesis is that many TSMs have effective existing networks of support and existing processes, both inside and out of TAP and the military, to manage the transition timeline that we can use as scaffolding for designing the progress and deadline tracking component of our product, while others do not have existing networks and processes, making them more vulnerable to having a difficult transition experience. Understanding the nuances and differences will enable us to enhance existing support and meet the needs of both groups.

## Recruitment üéØ	

### Recruitment approach

We are focused on TSMs and recently separated Veterans. We will use lean maximum variation strategy with the exception of age; the overwhelming majority of TSMs are under the age of 46. 

We are recruiting Transitioning Service Members (TSMs) and Recently Separated Veterans (RSV) with different lengths of service, branches served, and discharge characters.

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**

Perigean will recruit and schedule 12 qualified participants for each group outlined below.

**Primary criteria**

*Please consider each of the following three groups as a separate recruitment effort*

1. Transitioning service members and Recently Separated Veterans (within the last year) who are or did participate in TAP
* At least 6 participants who anticipate receiving an honorable discharge
* At least 6 participants who are not receiving an honorable discharge
* At least 3 people who are retiring
  
2. Transitioning service members and Recently Separated Veterans (within the last year) who are not or did not participate in TAP
* At least 6 participants who anticipate receiving an honorable discharge
* At least 6 participants who are not receiving an honorable discharge
* At least 3 people who are retiring

**Secondary criteria**

Gender:
- At least 3 women

Inclusion:
- At least 3 people of color

Geographic distribution:
- 7 participants from the east coast
- 2 participants from the mid-west
- 3 participants from the west coast

Age:
- At least 4 people under the age of 30

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:
> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **1.5x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 10 ideal completed sessions, request 15 total participants)*

> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.**

- 
### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
