# Research Plan for ARM Team, Appoint a Representative - Digital Submit - User Test, 06/2024<a id="research-plan-for-arm-team-appoint-a-representative---digital-submit---user-test-062024"></a>

## Background<a id="background"></a>

Create a high-quality accessible service or suite of services within VA.gov to serve Veterans in finding and managing their accredited representatives (Power of Attorney (POA)) and to support the deprecation of the legacy system used to take those actions.

[Link to product brief.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/9c884d56087c31b9422840cc233009d12e870b9b/products/accredited-representation-management/product-outline.md)


### OCTO Priorities<a id="octo-priorities"></a>

**Objective 1:** Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

- **Key Result 2:** Number of transactions processed using our products have increased by 25%.

- **Key Result 4:** No transactions accepted by our products have a fatal error.

[2024 OCTO Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md)


### Veteran Journey<a id="veteran-journey"></a>

Veterans, their family members, and caregivers can get the help of a representative at any point in the journey where they are submitting claims. Such as; starting up, taking care of myself, retiring, and aging.

Full [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) for reference.


## Research Goals<a id="research-goals"></a>

- Understand how Veterans search, select, and expect to work with a representative.

- Evaluate if changes to Find a Representative address previous research findings.

- Evaluate if adding in digital submit and design changes to Appoint a Representative, cause any usability challenges with users.


### Outcome<a id="outcome"></a>

- Information on how Veterans search, find, and want to work with a representative will provide input on how Find and Appoint work together.

- User testing will inform adjustments to the Find and Appoint a Representative flows (21-22 form only) to improve usability.


### Research questions<a id="research-questions"></a>

1. What methods do Veterans use today to find representation?

2. Are we hearing the same feedback from Veterans after Find a Representative updates?

3. Do Veterans see themselves using Find and Appoint together as a process?

4. Are there any usability challenges with the Find and Appoint user flows?

   1. Do users understand the information shown?

      1. Is there any information missing?

   2. Are there any challenges with using the experience?

   3. Are the next steps clear and actionable?


### Hypothesis<a id="hypothesis"></a>

1. Veterans are looking for a trusted source for representation.

2. Veterans will want to use Find and Appoint together by finding a representative first, contacting the representative, then filling out the form.

3. Veterans will have an easy time navigating our form through tested patterns and informative content.

4. Veterans will prefer to use the online digital submission option of the 21-22, rather than downloading and filling out on their own.


## Methodology<a id="methodology"></a>

- **Warm-up questions /** The moderator will ask the Veteran a short series of questions to understand their current status with finding a representative and VA.gov engagement.

- **Usability testing** / Users will be asked to engage with a prototype to test usability, understandability of content, and desirability of features.
