### Research Goal 

To understand the usability and accessibility needs of VSO power users interacting with the VA Design System, informing the development of efficient components that enhance workflow and ensure compliance with 508 standards. 

### Objectives 

*   Identify usability challenges faced by VSO power users in the current interfaces. 
    
*   Gather feedback from VFS teams exploring non-veteran-facing solutions. 
    

Recent product discussions have emphasized the need to adapt and expand the VA Design System to better serve VSO power users. This report synthesizes insights from recent meetings, highlighting the importance of accessibility, usability, and collaboration in the exploratory process. 

### Current Challenges 

1.  Accessibility Compliance Accessibility compliance is essential for all VA software. However, there is a distinct difference between the VA\-level of accessibility and the Government\-level accessibility.  
    
2.  User Interface Limitations Current non-veteran-facing interfaces require the use of more appropriate design components that take into consideration the viewport and the actions within that space. 

3.  Resource Constraints     

Design and development teams may lack sufficient resources for the redesign and implementation of new components. 

4.  Stakeholder Buy-In 

Gaining support from all stakeholders, including management and users, is crucial for successful implementation. 

### Recommendations for Expansion 

1.  Collaborative Development: Collaborate with the VADS team to develop non-veteran-facing components that meet accessibility standards and user needs, mitigating compliance risks. 

2.  Focus on User-Centric Design: Engage VSO power users for feedback on usability and functionality, prioritizing features like sortable and filterable tables for dense information. 

3.  Iterative Implementation: Adopt an incremental redesign approach, prioritizing critical features for a testable product launch while addressing compliance in subsequent iterations. 

4.  Advocacy for Non-Veteran-Facing Design Systems: Continue discussions in governance meetings to advocate for a design system tailored specifically for non-veteran users. 
    

### Conclusion 

Expanding the VA Design System to better align with VSO power users is essential for enhancing usability and functionality. By prioritizing collaboration, user feedback, and iterative design, the VA can create a system that effectively serves both internal and external stakeholders, ultimately improving the efficiency of veteran services
