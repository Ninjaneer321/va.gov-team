****Intro - 5 minutes**** \
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Marisa and I’m a user experience researcher working for VA.gov. Michael will be joining us as our official notetaker.

- This session should take about an hour. We’ll be focusing on your experiences as an applicant attempting to fill out the application to become an accredited attorney with the VA.
  - Confirming your current title is \[title], you’ve recently applied to become accredited as either an attorney or claims agent?
    - If not, thank them for their time.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions to help improve digital tools for VA. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- Your participation is completely voluntary. If for any reason you want to stop, or do not want to answer a question, please let me know.

- I want to be transparent that myself and my co-workers are here in a research capacity only. Your honest opinions will not impact your accreditation in any way, and we want to hear about your experiences, good or bad, in case there are processes we can improve in the future.

- Knowing this, I have \[#] VA employees who would like to observe our session, but are optional. Would that be okay, or do you prefer to keep the session to just the three of us?

  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.

  - If yes: Admit observers.

    - Then, ask the observer(s) to give a brief, camera-on introduction, first name and position with VA.gov.
    - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observer(s) to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

- Are you ok if I record my screen and audio for analysis and reporting purposes? We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video or audio clips with our colleagues at VA. Nothing is ever shared outside of VA. If we do share video or audio we don’t share anything that identifies you, such as your name or face.
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_Start recording._&#x20;

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today for analysis and reporting purposes?


## **w Questions – 30 mins**&#x20;


### Intro
We are working with OGC to find ways to improve efficiencies for updating information in their database of representatives. 

This information is what Veterans see when they search for VSOs on the website, let me show you what this looks like for context. Screenshare OGC database and FAR.

1. Are you familiar with either of these search tools? If so, what do you use them for?

2. How many certifying officials do you have at your organization?

3. Is “certifying official” the way you describe yourselves? Is this a job title or just what you use when you’re communicating with OGC?
4. How many VSO representatives do you [each] support? 

5. Do you support singly accredited or cross-accredited VSO representatives, or both?

6. Can you talk us through your current process for updating contact information for the representatives you support?

7. Do other certifying officials at your organization also request updates to contact information? Does anyone else? 

8. How often do you need to update your representatives’ contact information?

9. What type of information tends to need updating most often?

10. What challenges do you have with keeping contact information up to date?

11. Does your organization have a directory of your service officers and their contact information?
If so, can you share the link? (Maybe screenshare)

12. How do you keep that content up-to-date?

**Let’s talk about emails.**
1. Do your VSO representatives have multiple professional email addresses? 
- If so, which one do they tend to use to communicate with their Veteran clients? 

2. Which one would you want displayed to Veterans for them to contact the representative, and is this different from what they’d want VA to use to contact them?

3. If the VSO representatives you support have a VA.gov email account, do they use it to communicate with Veterans at all? If so, have you noticed confusion as far as them thinking you work for VA? 

4. If cross-accredited, do you know if your representatives have emails associated with each of the organizations? Do you know if they use those emails?

5. Anything else we should know about email addresses?

**Let’s talk about addresses**
1. Does your organization support Veterans in person, remotely, or hybrid?

2. Do any of your representatives work fully remotely? If so, would you want this indicated in the public-facing directory?

3. Would you ever want the address set to private (not displayed publicly)?

4. Do your representatives have multiple possible addresses? 
If so, what address would you want a Veteran to see/use, if any?

5. Is it the same or a different address from what you’d want the VA and OGC to use to communicate with you?

6. Anything else we should know about locations and addresses?
