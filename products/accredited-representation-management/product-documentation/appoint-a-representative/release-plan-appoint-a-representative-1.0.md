## Rollback Process

While we cannot think of any events that would be critical enough to merit a rollback, the following rollback process has been outlined just in case we need it.

**The rollback process is:**
1. Turn off the frontend feature toggle `appoint_a_representative_enable_frontend` 
   1. Submit a PR
2. Alert the team in [#benefits-representation-management](https://slack.com/archives/C05L6HSJLHM) that the rollback process has been initiated
   1. Include any details as to what triggered the rollback
   2. Tag relevant teammates (@benefits-arm-core, @benefits-arm-enablement, @benefits-arm-vba)
3. Create a ticket to document:
   1. A summary of what caused the rollback process
   2. Confirmation that the feature toggle has been turned off (or that a PR has been submitted)
   3. Next step ideas for solving the rollback trigger
   4. Other relevant links/images
   5. Link to initial Slack alert for reference
4. Follow up in the Slack alert thread with a link to the ticket
