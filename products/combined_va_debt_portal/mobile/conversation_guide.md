# Session

## Intro and Logistics

Thank you so much for joining today. My name is Emily, and [NAME] here will be taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the digital waiting room who would like to observe, but weâ€™ll get to that momentarily.

Today, weâ€™ll be discussing how people think about and manage certain financial items. Primarily: medical copayments and debts from things like benefit overpayments. I'd like to check in first â€“ are you comfortable dicussing these topics?

Before we start, I have a few logistics to cover:



* I have [number] colleagues who are interested in observing this session to better understand the Veteran experience. Would you be okay with them observing?
    * If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    * If yes: Admit observers.
    * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
    * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

* This will take about 60 minutes. Because I want to keep us on time, I may occasionally prompt you to the next topic.
* We want your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers, and weâ€™re not testing anything of you. I will not be offended by any opinions you share.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* Iâ€™ll be having you work with a prototype for part of today. It may look and act like the real app and website, but itâ€™s only a demo tool and therefore lots of elements will not be working. You will not be logged into your account, so nothing you do will affect your benefits or anything else in your account.
* If you would be okay with it, we would like to record this session today, but let me explain things first before you consent. 
    * The purpose is to assure that we capture your opinions accurately. Your name and other identifying information will never be used when reporting on this project â€“ for example we assign you a participant ID (such as P7) if quoting you. And after we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed.
    * Knowing this, are you comfortable with me recording the session?
    * And also, it can sometimes be helpful to share video clips from sessions to our VA partners so they can better understand the experiences of Veterans. In these clips, we blur out anything that could identify you â€“ your profile photo for example â€“ and they would only be shared among VA partners. I will also ask at the end of this session so that you could veto, but knowing this, would you be comfortable with us potentially using a clip from this session?
    * [if yes] Iâ€™m going to start the recording, and once I do Iâ€™m going to confirm once more that youâ€™re okay with the recording.

Start recording.



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?


## Discussion

Could you tell me a bit about yourself as a Veteran: what branch of the military did you serve, and when did you retire or separate?

How have you been involved with the VA â€“ both in the past and now?

* Have you been in any of their facilities?
* Have you used the website?
