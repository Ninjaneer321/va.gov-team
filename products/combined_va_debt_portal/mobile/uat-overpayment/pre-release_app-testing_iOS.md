1. Request public TestFlight install link from mobile engineering ([sample one for practice](https://testflight.apple.com/join/peHBN4k9))

*Offer to help them turn off notifications before sharing screen (pull down from upper right, select Focus)*

2. Download TestFlight
3. Open TestFlight to accept terms + conditions. Stop once they get to “Ready to Test” screen
4. Return to browser, install VA Health and Benefits app
    1. If they have the public version, this will install over it


## Clean-up



1. Reinstall public version of VA app
    1. Go to app store - downloading the public version will install over the beta version
2. Uninstall TestFlight
3. Log into VA app
4. (if relevant) Turn notifications back on


## Notes



* Alternatively, we can add participants manually to TestFlight, which triggers an automated invitation email to them.
* The pre-release version of the app will replace the standard version
* Make sure they do not close any apps as they’re switching between them
* If anyone is using two devices on the Zoom call:
    * When joining on phone, on the screen with the Join button, tap the speaker icon in upper right, select No audio. This will disable speaker and microphone; otherwise you’re not able to lower the volume all the way down once you’re in the call.
    * On their other device, set microphone and speaker as normal.
* Technical pre-requisites for participants (for both iOS and Android)
    * **VA Credentials:** You have a username & password for ID.me or Login.gov and can access your two-factor authentication (text code or app).
    * **Email Access:** You can open your email directly on your mobile phone to click the test link.
    * **Testing Tools:** You are willing to download TestFlight (iOS) or Firebase App Distribution (Android).
    * **Storage:** You have at least 200MB of free space.
    * **Phone operating system version:**
        * **iPhone:** iOS 16 or newer.
        * **Android:** Android 12 or newer.
    * **App Replacement:** If you have the standard VA app, the test version will temporarily replace it. (If you don't have the app, it will simply install as a new one). We will help you restore the original version at the end.
    * **Android Permissions:** You are comfortable allowing your phone to "Install Unknown Apps" within your security settings for this session.
    * **Connection:** You will be connected to WiFi during our call for a stable download.
