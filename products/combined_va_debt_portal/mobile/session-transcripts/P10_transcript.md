00:00:00,Emily,Ask those questions.
00:00:01,Emily,"ask those questions again. So to confirm, are you okay? If I record our video and audio as we talk today."
00:00:09,P10,It's no problem.
00:00:11,Emily,"Yeah, great. Thank you. And then, are you okay? If we potentially use some clips to show our Va partners from today."
00:00:18,P10,Yes.
00:00:19,Emily,"Okay, great. Thank you."
00:00:20,Emily,"So first, st just overall questions I love and and whatever you are comfortable sharing, I'd love to know a bit about yourself as a veteran could be. What branch you served when you retired or separated."
00:00:34,P10,"So I was in [redacted]. I was in from 2,007 to 2,011."
00:00:39,Emily,"Okay, great. And what sort of interaction and experience have you had with the Va. Since then?"
00:00:49,P10,"So I 1st got [redacted] in 2017, and and and June"
00:00:56,P10,I got [redacted]. So.
00:00:59,Emily,Got it. Okay.
00:00:59,P10,So I've been dealing with the Va. For about 7 years. I guess.
00:01:04,Emily,Alright.
00:01:05,P10,"So any gears, I guess."
00:01:08,Emily,"Yeah. Okay, and oh, sorry. Go ahead."
00:01:13,P10,Up into like vas from [redacted] as well. So I've been.
00:01:26,P10,To quite a few different vas.
00:01:28,Emily,"Yeah, sounds like it, all right."
00:01:30,Emily,And what sort of experience have you had with the with with Va's website? And or the mobile app.
00:01:39,P10,"I've been using both quite regularly since 2017. I've seen, like all the improvements that they've made over the years. It's definitely become a lot more user friendly. And then I've been seeing the updates that's been added to the app in the last couple of years as well. So."
00:01:58,Emily,Okay.
00:01:59,P10,"I would say, the advancement of the softwares, and everything like that has been"
00:02:07,P10,pretty good it's been has been slowly modernized.
00:02:13,Emily,"Nice, alright and in excuse me. In what? Instances? Would you use choose to use the mobile app over the website."
00:02:24,P10,"The mobile app. I can just do like the 2 step authentication with my finger, or whatever. So it's definitely quicker."
00:02:34,P10,And
00:02:37,P10,"if I so pretty much, you can do everything, I believe, on the mobile app, except like, do travel claims."
00:02:46,P10,yeah. So it's it's
00:02:48,P10,"it's comparable to the to the website. Now, there's a few things that you can't do on the mobile app but prime all the primary thing task and everything you can just do from your phone. That's what I've noticed."
00:03:01,Emily,"Okay, got it. And so you said, Is it you mentioned the the authentication? So is it. Is it easier on the mobile app. Is that why you're choosing that I just wanna make sure I'm understanding when you're."
00:03:12,P10,"Yes, faster, it's faster. It takes seconds. It takes seconds if I do it, to go through the website I have to"
00:03:20,P10,"go through if id me, and maybe it takes like a minute"
00:03:25,P10,to go through that process. So.
00:03:29,Emily,"Okay, got it great. So now we're moving on to the financial portion of the discussion. And I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have absolutely no information about you or your finances for the Va. So 1st have you had experience with owing the Va. Money for things like benefit, overpayments."
00:03:52,P10,Yeah. So I was in school from [redacted]. And I was in the [redacted] program. So there was a overpayment
00:04:05,P10,"and I think December of last year it finally got paid off. So they took like [redacted] bucks a month, for"
00:04:13,P10,"I don't know. Maybe a year, I think."
00:04:15,Emily,Got it.
00:04:17,Emily,Okay? So so it sounds like that was paid off by your your benefits being reduced. Is that right?
00:04:23,P10,It they got it automatically withdrew from my monthly deposit.
00:04:27,Emily,"Got it. Okay, all right. And do you recall how you originally notified of this debt?"
00:04:36,P10,So I wasn't notified.
00:04:38,Emily,You weren't okay.
00:04:40,P10,I wasn't notified.
00:04:42,P10,And then I just I just happened to look at my deposit amounts one day.
00:04:47,P10,"and I was like, Oh, that doesn't look right. So I end up calling the BA. And then they end up explaining to me that"
00:04:56,P10,"I had a school payment overpayment, so."
00:05:04,P10,"I may have received the letter, but I do not recall receiving a letter."
00:05:08,Emily,Okay. They they said they had milled one.
00:05:11,P10,Yeah.
00:05:11,Emily,Got it. Okay.
00:05:14,P10,"And then, like on the on the website. If you see like overpayments, it never showed up there."
00:05:22,Emily,"Oh, okay, interesting. Okay. So it wouldn't. Didn't show up there."
00:05:24,Emily,Good.
00:05:25,P10,"It didn't show up at all, so I was just getting deducted. That [redacted] bucks, and the only way I knew what it was is, I have to call and confirm."
00:05:35,Emily,"Hmm, okay."
00:05:37,Emily,Got it? Alright. And then thoughts on how that whole process could have been made easier for you.
00:05:48,P10,Some type of.
00:05:50,P10,"I mean, we live in a kind of a digital world these days. So some type of notification within the app or some type of email notification would have."
00:06:02,P10,Helped. Because.
00:06:06,P10,"yeah, I mean, sometimes the the Va knows you multiple letters when you're going through the claims process. You're going through appointments and stuff like that. And every letter, if I get it digitally"
00:06:19,P10,like I may not open up the mail immediately. So just having some type of digital notification would have
00:06:27,P10,"assisted me. And you know, understanding what was happening."
00:06:30,Emily,Got it. Okay.
00:06:32,Emily,"sounds good. Okay. And then, switching gears a tiny bit. Have you had any experience with paying any medical co-payments through the Va."
00:06:44,P10,"I think I only did it once, and that's when I 1st got a service connected. I think it was in [redated] only did only did a a copayment once, and it was like $50 ago. Since then I have never paid anything."
00:07:02,Emily,"Okay. Got it? Alright. So let me have you have you share your screen now, and let me know if you need any help doing that."
00:07:12,P10,Okay.
00:07:27,P10,you just hit the share button right?
00:07:30,Emily,Yep.
00:07:31,P10,And then.
00:07:32,Emily,Extra permissions.
00:07:34,P10,And then screen. After that.
00:07:36,Emily,Yep.
00:07:44,P10,So it was giving me a list. Do I choose zoom.
00:07:47,Emily,Yeah. So it's 2. Zoom should probably be at the bottom. It's usually alphabetical.
00:07:50,P10,"Yeah, yeah, it's disabled art."
00:07:57,Emily,Alright great and then let me have you share screen. So let me have you open up the mobile app figma. Now.
00:08:10,P10,Okay.
00:08:24,P10,I have it opened.
00:08:25,Emily,Okay. And I'm gonna get so go to login. I'm gonna give you some test credentials. Here.
00:08:39,P10,All right.
00:08:40,Emily,"Okay, so the email is going to be VA test 0 0"
00:08:51,Emily,at gmail.com.
00:08:59,P10,And the password is gonna be VAVA VAVA.
00:09:04,Emily,8 characters.
00:09:12,Emily,Okay? And I'll just need to get the authentication code. So give me just a moment.
00:09:20,Emily,"Okay, it's gonna okay. Code is 6, 0, 6,"
00:09:28,Emily,"7, 9, 7, 3."
00:09:39,Emily,"All right, continue with the app."
00:09:49,Emily,Okay? And then I'm gonna send a link to the Zoom chat.
00:09:56,Emily,If you can switch back to zoom and open up that message to tap on this link.
00:10:17,P10,It's an error.
00:10:19,Emily,Can you switch back to let me see if it's not available? Try again. Go go back to zoom.
00:10:29,Emily,Yeah.
00:10:44,P10,Do I need to do this right here? Tap.
00:10:46,Emily,"No, that you can just tap anywhere outside of that. It just it. Sometimes it's a little bit slow, but it looks like it's working."
00:10:55,P10,Okay.
00:10:56,Emily,"Yeah, there we go. All right. We have it here. Okay, so here we have our fake mobile app here."
00:11:04,Emily,"So first, st without any sort of tapping. You can scroll around, certainly, but just don't tap. Don't yet tap into anything. Where would you expect to find information on money that you owe specifically for overpayments?"
00:11:26,P10,I mean it should be on this 1st page.
00:11:28,P10,I would think it would be right below last payment.
00:11:31,Emily,"Okay, what?"
00:11:36,P10,Something that was like. I don't know if you're getting.
00:11:40,Emily,It. It'd be what sorry I missed that.
00:11:43,P10,I said. If there was some like itemized thing right below last payment showing deductions that would be.
00:11:49,P10,"I think that's where it should be, or even on the payments. Page."
00:11:53,Emily,Okay. Got it
00:11:56,Emily,all right. Thoughts on. Since you mentioned that that payments page thoughts on the the title of that.
00:12:05,P10,Payments.
00:12:06,Emily,Yep.
00:12:13,P10,"I mean, I think the the title is clear. I mean."
00:12:21,P10,"yeah, I think I mean, I think it's fine."
00:12:23,Emily,"Okay, great. I'll have you tap into that. Since you mentioned that the the payments, tab."
00:12:29,P10,Okay.
00:12:29,Emily,Okay.
00:12:31,Emily,"and in this scenario we will. We will pretend that you that you also have medical copays. But thoughts on what you're seeing here, especially as it relates to the the title of payments."
00:12:46,P10,"I mean, this is."
00:12:48,P10,I mean this. This makes sense like the overpayment for debts and co-pays listed here on this page. This makes sense.
00:12:57,P10,So.
00:12:59,Emily,"Okay, got it. And how about the the bit of information that is below the words overpayment debts and below Copays? What sort of information. Might you want to know? There."
00:13:13,P10,"If I click the arrow, would it list what it's for?"
00:13:17,Emily,"We'll we'll we'll get to that very shortly. But I'm I'm wondering what like what might be the most helpful specifically from this screen to know, for either the overpayment or the co-pays."
00:13:32,P10,"I think this information is pretty clear like it says the total amount, and then the number of different debts you owe, and then, for the co-pays"
00:13:42,P10,"has a total, and then there's 2 bills. So I mean with"
00:13:49,P10,"I mean, normally, you should know a veteran should know if they have some type of overpayment"
00:13:56,P10,or copays due cause.
00:13:58,P10,When you go to
00:14:01,P10,"you should get some receipt or notification, or something like that. When you go to the Va. Or to an outpatient clinic for the co-pays"
00:14:09,P10,and
00:14:11,P10,"for the debts. I mean. I'm pretty sure a lot of veterans are watching their deposits every month, so"
00:14:21,P10,If they got overpaid they probably know.
00:14:24,Emily,"Got it. Okay? Great so if you want, you can tap into the overpayment debt. Since we talked about that."
00:14:31,P10,Okay.
00:14:32,Emily,"And then thoughts here on overall. How clear is it? What what you owe, and what sort of information would you be looking for here."
00:14:44,P10,It seems like
00:14:51,P10,"I mean, I guess it's pretty, is. It looks pretty clear and standard information that I would expect to see that the full sign, the gi bill for housing."
00:15:01,P10,I know I've I've heard of veterans getting overpaid for that.
00:15:09,P10,"I don't know for the for the books how you would get an overpayment for that, but it's listed."
00:15:16,P10,And
00:15:20,P10,"yeah, it looks like it looks pretty straightforward."
00:15:23,Emily,Exactly
00:15:25,Emily,"if and then, in this pretense pretend scenario. If you were to incur a new debt, how would you expect to know that there is something new here."
00:15:36,P10,Some type of like on payments like if you put like a
00:15:46,P10,"So a lot of apps when you have an update. There's like a red dot or something like that. So if you had like, some type of dot or number"
00:15:59,P10,above payments like when you go onto the app.
00:16:02,P10,I see some type of notification. So you click it. And then you can see that information.
00:16:08,Emily,"Okay, got it, got it?"
00:16:11,Emily,"And then how about if there was a debt listed or a debt here that has already paid, been paid off. What if anything, would you want to see here regarding that debt."
00:16:24,P10,Closed.
00:16:26,Emily,Closed. Okay.
00:16:28,P10,Some type of yeah clothes or some type of other
00:16:32,P10,wording that says it's been paid.
00:16:37,Emily,"Okay, got it and let me have you scroll to the top."
00:16:44,P10,Okay.
00:16:45,Emily,So that the top one for housing. Let me have you tap into that and have a look to see what information would be important to you for this particular debt.
00:17:17,P10,So for this or whatever.
00:17:21,P10,"I mean, all this stuff looks great that I'm seeing here. The only thing that kind of shocked me to see is the late fee."
00:17:28,Emily,Okay.
00:17:29,P10,If it's being automatically deducted from your Va.
00:17:34,P10,"Money, your disability compensation."
00:17:39,P10,Why would a late fee even be calculated in?
00:17:43,P10,"That's the only thing that comes to mind immediately. But I mean this, this looks"
00:17:49,P10,like it should look. I I would say.
00:17:54,Emily,"Okay, so we'll we'll pretend that this particular debt"
00:17:59,Emily,"has to be directly paid as as opposed to having it being deducted from from your benefits, thought what specifically or what pieces of information would be important for you to know here, knowing that."
00:18:16,P10,"Well, it has a due date on it, and"
00:18:27,P10,and I guess at the bottom it it says that
00:18:30,P10,you were sent a letter. So
00:18:33,P10,"I mean, this information looks pretty straightforward."
00:18:36,Emily,Okay. Got it
00:18:38,Emily,"since you brought the the debt letter. What might you use that section for, or what what might be important in regards to the Debt letter, history."
00:18:49,P10,If you can click it and see the letter digitally.
00:18:56,Emily,"Okay, got it."
00:18:59,Emily,"And thoughts on anything. You might or yeah, any other. Any other information you might want here, or anything you might want to do from here."
00:19:15,P10,So may I see the demand? Letter?
00:19:20,P10,"When you see the words, why might I have this debt? So if it gives a clear and concise, like explanation. Why."
00:19:28,P10,"cause maybe you're confused, I guess, and you don't know why, even if you did see the the debt letter down there, so"
00:19:37,P10,maybe some direct contact information.
00:19:40,Emily,Hmm.
00:19:42,P10,Or something like that to reach out.
00:19:48,Emily,So what I I know you said so. In case you weren't aware why you had the debt. Other reasons you might want to reach out to them.
00:19:56,P10,"Yeah, so I would. Wanna I would wanna call"
00:19:59,P10,and talk to someone if I didn't understand why I was being
00:20:05,P10,"why, there was an overpayment."
00:20:08,P10,So some type of contact information.
00:20:11,P10,But maybe the debt letter has that on it
00:20:14,P10,or the demand letter. I don't know.
00:20:18,Emily,Alright. Are there other places you might expect to find contact information.
00:20:23,P10,"Well, I would assume it might be on a demand letter, but"
00:20:27,P10,"it might not. They'll probably just have a standard Va. 800 number on there. But if I were to well, if you have contact."
00:20:36,P10,just added a contact block or something like that
00:20:39,P10,"up under, why, I might have this debt."
00:20:43,P10,"That would probably be cool, because."
00:20:46,P10,maybe you can just reach out immediately and get a direct person instead of going through the 800 number
00:20:54,P10,and clicking all the prompts just to get to someone who transfers you. So if you had direct contact information about this specific debt
00:21:03,P10,that would probably be good.
00:21:06,Emily,"Okay? And then, since you mentioned the why might I have this debt? Let me have you tap into that and see"
00:21:14,Emily,your your thoughts on the information there.
00:21:19,P10,"Yeah, that's pretty standard."
00:21:22,P10,"It's pretty standard, but it is not, is."
00:21:24,P10,It gives you 3 options to ponder.
00:21:29,P10,"So instead of 3 options, if there was some way to know exactly what it is, and that's why I was mentioning the"
00:21:38,P10,some type of way to contact about it. A direct line to contact.
00:21:44,Emily,Got it. Okay.
00:21:45,P10,"Like, if you if you're in this situation, you know you're suspended. You know you're on academic probation. You know you withdrew from class or you, and you know you've received duplicate payments. But I would want exactly why"
00:21:59,P10,"that would be helpful, instead of having to think about all 3 of these things."
00:22:07,Emily,"Okay, makes sense. So was it, is it here you would want the contact information or somewhere else."
00:22:15,P10,"Maybe below this link that I clicked. [link = ""why might I have this debt""]"
00:22:19,Emily,"Okay, I got it. Let me have you go tap close here."
00:22:29,Emily,"so we'll we'll pretend that this part of the new app is, is built as is just as you're seeing if it were built like this, how? And knowing things that you were looking for, that you were not able to find. How likely do you think it would be that you would use it."
00:22:52,P10,"I mean, it gives me enough information to go off of."
00:22:55,P10,so I would definitely use it just to have some information.
00:23:04,P10,"I mean, you don't have to look that far like if you just go to payments, it's like 3 clicks, and you know exactly what you're being deducted by. So"
00:23:15,P10,think that's pretty convenient.
00:23:19,Emily,"Okay, great let me have you tap on the payments button on the lower right. I'm gonna get you to a different section. Have a few more questions, and then scroll all the way to the bottom."
00:23:30,Emily,and then the the blank gray area. Tap once into that
00:23:37,Emily,great and then tap on overpayment debts again. Excuse me.
00:23:45,Emily,"Okay, so this is slightly different. So again, we're gonna look at that this, this top"
00:23:52,Emily,debt. Here the the debt for housing
00:23:56,Emily,"thoughts on on the information here and again, what other steps you might want to take from the app here"
00:24:06,Emily,specifically for for that? Yep.
00:24:10,P10,"Well, it's definitely a lot different, because it says review details."
00:24:13,P10,"So I would expect it to give me some type of itemized information, and it gives you a resolved debt. So"
00:24:21,P10,"if you choose to pay hit off, I'm ex."
00:24:26,P10,"I would assume that. You can just click this, and you know. Get to a payment screen."
00:24:32,P10,So there's definitely a lot more information.
00:24:35,Emily,Okay? Yeah. And you can. You can go ahead and and tap through and see what what you'd want to do here.
00:24:49,P10,"Yeah, yeah, like this, pay a line other ways to pay. And you can request help so that"
00:24:58,P10,"that's cool it definitely simplifies, the whole process."
00:25:04,Emily,"Okay, great."
00:25:05,Emily,"When when you say simplifies the whole process, can you say more about that?"
00:25:10,P10,"So if I you know, maybe I don't want"
00:25:15,P10,I wanna take care of this. So I just hit resolve that pay online
00:25:23,P10,"and then other ways to pay. I can, you know, pretty much. Just click."
00:25:27,P10,"resolve that hit, pay online or other ways."
00:25:31,P10,"And then maybe I don't have the money, so hit. Request, help to see what type of services are available. So"
00:25:39,P10,that's pretty straightforward for me.
00:25:42,Emily,Okay. Great.
00:25:43,P10,So.
00:25:44,Emily,"Yeah. So, following up on something you just said, we're gonna pretend that you don't have the money, and you said you would tap the request, help! Let me let me let me have you do that to see"
00:25:54,Emily,if that would be what you might be looking for.
00:26:02,P10,"Oh, yeah, that makes sense."
00:26:06,Emily,Okay.
00:26:12,P10,"It's kind of like transunion, or whatever."
00:26:16,Emily,It's it's like what sorry.
00:26:20,P10,"Transunion, like the creditors."
00:26:23,Emily,You can dispute
00:26:27,P10,"Yeah, man, this, this is good. I think this is great."
00:26:31,Emily,"Great. All right, let me have you close that, and then we'll pretend that you are ready to make a payment. Let me have you walk through that process, and I promise I won't have you enter in any real information."
00:26:45,P10,Okay.
00:26:54,P10,So should I hit the pay.
00:26:57,Emily,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll. We'll pretend that you are actually going to pay."
00:27:01,P10,Okay.
00:27:02,Emily,To see what what the process feels like to you.
00:27:13,Emily,"so I'll have you tap. I know there's a lot to read, so I won't, I'll actually have you? Have you been to this site before? I know you said your your debt was just removed from your benefits? But have you? Have you made any payments through this site before."
00:27:25,P10,"No, I've never seen this before."
00:27:26,Emily,"Got it. Okay? Great so again, I know there's a lot. So I'm just gonna have you skip ahead. And there's a there's 2 small pay online buttons that the teal ones is one toward the top and one toward the bottom tap. Either one of those there we go, and then a section in the middle where there are some blank spaces. Let me get your thoughts on"
00:27:49,Emily,what you would need to actually pay anything here.
00:27:54,P10,"Okay, so the for the veteran information."
00:28:00,P10,The file number pay pay number.
00:28:06,P10,"I would. I mean, maybe this information. Once you click that link through the"
00:28:13,P10,"through the app. Maybe it should auto fill, because I would know I wouldn't know my phone number offhand. I wouldn't know my pay number off hand as well."
00:28:24,P10,"So, or the deduction code."
00:28:27,P10,"So maybe that information needs to be auto filled just for convenience, because you'll be going back and forth"
00:28:34,P10,"like, I'm gonna have to screenshot the file number or copy the file number, which I don't even think you can copy and paste in the app. So"
00:28:43,P10,"maybe that information needs to be automatically filled in. For convenience. If you're clicking through the app,"
00:28:53,P10,"the rest information, first, st name, last name, phone a standard"
00:28:57,P10,and what amount you want to pay. So that's that's pretty straightforward.
00:29:03,Emily,"Okay, and let me let me have you switch back to the figma app. Just wanted to have you look@thisfirstst"
00:29:13,Emily,Okay? Actually hold on just a moment because switch head to. You know.
00:29:18,Emily,this. Does this a lot hold on a second.
00:29:20,Emily,"I'm gonna send you a different link in the zoom, chat."
00:29:26,P10,"There should be one that yeah, so tap that second link."
00:29:32,Emily,It'll just be a slight shortcut to where I want us to go.
00:29:42,P10,Okay.
00:29:42,Emily,"Okay, so tap on payments again, and then overpayment debts."
00:29:52,Emily,review details
00:29:58,Emily,and resolve debt and then pay online. Just going to get you back to the screen that you were okay. This one. Yes. So my hope was that this screen would stay when when you came back to Figma. But that doesn't always happen. So talk to me about I know you said that it would be convenient for things to Autofill
00:30:18,Emily,"if they were not. If you were, if you just had this information. And then we're, as you said, going back and forth. Talk to me about how you might do that what sort of experience that might be."
00:30:32,P10,"Like, I said. I don't think you can."
00:30:34,P10,If I held the number just to copy it. Can I do that?
00:30:38,P10,I don't think you can copy and paste in the app.
00:30:41,Emily,"I'm not sure. Well, especially not here. This is Figma. So I'm actually not sure but it was so."
00:30:45,P10,Would that be something.
00:30:46,Emily,"You. Oh, sorry! Go ahead."
00:30:48,P10,"I don't think you can, for sure."
00:30:52,Emily,"What? So, knowing that you're not able to copy what else do you think you might? You might do if you were trying to pay."
00:31:00,P10,"I'll just have to. Just switch screens, you know."
00:31:06,Emily,Remember the number type it in. It doesn't.
00:31:11,P10,Apps. When you go back and forth it'll remove the numbers.
00:31:15,P10,It'll start you over so hopefully. That doesn't happen.
00:31:18,Emily,Good point. Okay. Yep.
00:31:19,Emily,"I also hope that would not. Not one that would not would not happen. Okay, okay."
00:31:27,Emily,"and then, so okay, we're we're gonna pretend that you have made the payment after you have made the payment, what would how or what? What would you expect to see, and how quickly with with within the app, after you've made that payment."
00:31:47,P10,Some type of payment confirmation.
00:31:50,P10,I would like to receive an email saying that.
00:31:55,P10,"your payment was processed. And then when I go, if I go, maybe the balance is reduced."
00:32:15,Emily,"Okay,"
00:32:19,Emily,"And then oh, I forgot to ask question before since we talked about getting help in terms of payment plans or disputing debts."
00:32:30,Emily,How or or had you been aware that there are options like that.
00:32:36,P10,"No, I did not know that."
00:32:38,Emily,"Did not. Okay, got it?"
00:32:40,Emily,"And then ask another question that I asked before if the app were to be built just like this, how you're seeing, and that that includes the having to go back and forth between a browser and the mobile app to pay. How likely do you think it would be that you would use it, as is."
00:33:02,P10,"Well, I mean, that's the only option that you have, and it's the most convenient. I would definitely just go through the process."
00:33:10,P10,"yeah, I would just go through the process if that was the most convenient option versus going to a browser."
00:33:18,P10,"Or or talk to someone on the phone. This, I think, is, if sufficient enough."
00:33:26,Emily,"Okay, got it. And then how about comparing the 2 versions that we've seen with this one version, one being here where there is the payment option that you'd have to switch back and forth, and the 1st option sorry, the 1st version being where there were not any mentions of payments. Which one do you think you would be more likely to use? And why."
00:33:48,P10,"Yeah, the second one for sure, because it gives itemized information and options to resolve."
00:33:57,P10,"However, you choose to so definitely. The second option is better."
00:34:01,Emily,"Okay, got it."
00:34:03,Emily,It's good
00:34:04,Emily,"and maybe a tap back after overall question. Other thoughts on anything we're seeing here. It could be any additional information you might want to have, or any clarity, or the naming of anything."
00:34:26,P10,"The only thing, I think, would be a little confusing for veterans who never seen this information before is the deduction code."
00:34:36,Emily,Hmm.
00:34:39,P10,But but if you're you know you have school benefits and stuff like that you should be aware
00:34:49,P10,of
00:34:50,P10,all this information as far as like payments. If you did did get overpaid for something. And you know what
00:35:01,P10,program you're using.
00:35:02,P10,"So chapter 30, chapter 31 program that you're enrolled in. So that's all."
00:35:11,P10,Everything else good.
00:35:14,Emily,"Okay, sounds good. And I'll quickly go through another section and maybe you tap on the payments again."
00:35:25,Emily,All right. And we're gonna I know you said. You've only had one copay that you can recall. We're gonna pretend that you have Copay. So let me have you tap into the copay information.
00:35:36,P10,Okay.
00:35:38,Emily,And then thoughts on overall the information presented here. What do you think would be important for you to know.
00:35:49,P10,So how's the Va where the copay occurred? Looks like you can redo review the details on what it was for.
00:35:58,P10,You can pay the bill.
00:36:02,P10,"Yeah, this looks pretty straightforward."
00:36:05,Emily,Okay?
00:36:06,Emily,"And for that the the top one, the James A. Haley hospital. What information specifically for that one? Would you need to know."
00:36:21,P10,"Well, maybe the you can have have the date that the debt occurred."
00:36:30,P10,Maybe that is that up under review details.
00:36:32,Emily,"Yeah, yeah, if you sorry. If you if you want to tap into that, you can see if that that shows you things that you would be looking for."
00:36:41,P10,"Yes, so it does have that"
00:36:45,P10,"as a medication that you were charged for, and everything. So yeah, this this looks pretty straightforward."
00:36:54,P10,"it looks like. Also you can. I don't know. The account number was that for, but looks like you can copy that information directly from that which is cool and you can download a statement."
00:37:07,Emily,All right
00:37:09,Emily,regarding the the statements. Are our statements something that you use could be in really any aspect of your life. Now.
00:37:19,P10,For sure. Always download anything I have just to keep on on record in case anything happens.
00:37:24,Emily,"Got it. Okay? And is that something? You might do from the app, since there, there's the the statements here."
00:37:32,P10,"Yeah, cause. Now, I can download my benefit verification letter and stuff like that through the app. So having access to these Pdfs immediately it it. I think it makes everything more clear and concise and straightforward."
00:37:48,Emily,"Okay, great and let me have you tap into that. Pdf, since we've we're talking about that just to get a sense of what is here, and what might be useful for you."
00:38:05,P10,"I mean, this is an invoice. So. I think this is good. I mean, you can't have everything listed. It has education listed."
00:38:19,P10,"I don't. If you're paying by mail, you can enter this information. So that's I mean, this looks pretty great. Let me see if there is a"
00:38:29,P10,"Where is it? Oh, so it gives you where to mail it to, and everything like that. So."
00:38:35,P10,"yeah, this is, I mean, I would assume this would help a lot of veterans with"
00:38:45,P10,"this process, because it it gives you a formal formal documentation on everything. It's like receiving a bill that you for these or whatever. So yeah, I think this should help a lot of veterans"
00:39:01,P10,that might have overpayments or copays.
00:39:07,Emily,"Okay, got it all right. You can press done there."
00:39:13,Emily,"Okay, and then"
00:39:17,Emily,"if you were to, we're going to pretend that you see an error, for, let's say, one of those prescriptions you're sure that you didn't order or didn't didn't arrive. What would you do in that case, knowing that there was an error on this."
00:39:33,P10,"So you're talking about, for under the statement charges."
00:39:37,Emily,"Yeah. Yeah. So let's say, like that that. That second medication was something that that you didn't order or or didn't arrive, or something. What what would you do? In that case?"
00:39:48,P10,I would definitely click it
00:39:50,P10,if I could click it and.
00:39:53,Emily,That that top one you should be should be able to click. So we'll we'll pretend that you did not actually go to that doctor appointment if you wanna. So I think that one you can click into.
00:40:05,P10,"Yeah, I would want some type of way to I guess. Dispute."
00:40:10,Emily,Okay.
00:40:12,P10,Or let them know not receive something like that.
00:40:19,Emily,And and what sort of information would you be looking for? In order to do that.
00:40:25,P10,So once I click it.
00:40:29,P10,"Well, I don't know if I if if it's not clicking"
00:40:34,P10,if there was a way to confirm that you received medication.
00:40:43,P10,"Or confirm, or deny something like that."
00:40:46,Emily,"Okay, got it."
00:40:49,Emily,"Okay, let me have you go back to Copay Bill, just on the upper left there to get one screen back there you go alright."
00:40:59,Emily,Any any any place here you might expect to find any like any sort of contact information that we were like we were discussing a moment ago.
00:41:10,P10,"Well, it should be in on the it's on the Pdf. Right now. I saw it on the Pdf."
00:41:15,Emily,Okay. Yeah.
00:41:17,P10,"So I mean, that has all the information you're gonna need."
00:41:25,Emily,Okay?
00:41:26,Emily,"And then let's pretend that you are ready to pay this. Walk me through what you would do in this case. And again, like before, not going to have you enter in any real information at all."
00:41:40,P10,Okay.
00:41:46,P10,"yeah, it gives you 4 different options. So"
00:41:56,P10,so I will say that maybe some older vets will probably prefer prefer to pay by phone or mail or in person.
00:42:06,P10,"Younger bets will, you know, probably definitely opt into the pay online. So"
00:42:12,P10,"I guess it really just depends on the age demographic, on which one, but it definitely gives you 4 options."
00:42:19,P10,"So, so."
00:42:22,Emily,So let let me let me have you go through the process for for paying online.
00:42:27,P10,Okay.
00:42:35,Emily,And we have you tap on. Continue to the form. We'll just skip over this.
00:42:46,Emily,"So really, the yeah, so that that middle section there. Yeah. Thought, oh, yeah, yeah. Go ahead."
00:42:55,P10,For the account number.
00:42:58,P10,"Yeah, that's like the same thing from before."
00:43:03,P10,Having to remember this number.
00:43:08,Emily,"Okay, and let me have you switch back to Figma."
00:43:11,Emily,With any luck it will stay where we left it. Let's see if that is the case.
00:43:19,P10,No.
00:43:20,Emily,"Nope, go back to go back to zoom."
00:43:26,P10,But those.
00:43:58,Emily,"Okay. And yeah, there we go. Copays review details."
00:44:07,P10,"Yeah, but you can copy, you can copy this. So, yeah."
00:44:10,Emily,"Right? Yeah, yeah, I just want to get back to that."
00:44:11,P10,"Oh, I mean."
00:44:15,P10,"that's good. Yeah. You can at least copy the number and copy and paste and enter it in. Only thing is like, I will say that"
00:44:26,P10,when you copy it and then paste it. Is it gonna try to fill in one cell? Or is it gonna automatically add the numbers to all the cells.
00:44:36,Emily,The goal is
00:44:37,Emily,"into all 5. That's a very good question. So I know I know we wanted to do that. I'm not a developer, so I don't know the details of how possible it is. But that's what we want."
00:44:47,P10,"Yeah, that's possible. I've seen it before, but some web, some websites don't have that functionality."
00:44:54,P10,"Go into the 1st sale, and then you have to like."
00:44:58,P10,delete everything and then enter everything separately. So as long as you copy this and
00:45:04,P10,it fills in all the cells on the on the other page. It should be fine.
00:45:10,Emily,"Okay, got it? Yep."
00:45:11,Emily,"okay. So those those are my questions here. Anything else to add regarding the stuff that we've looked at, or maybe anything you haven't mentioned on things that could be useful in regards to the finance stuff here."
00:45:31,P10,So on this page right here the co-payment.
00:45:34,P10,It doesn't have the amount.
00:45:37,P10,It doesn't have any information.
00:45:40,P10,So so maybe you want to make a partial payment.
00:45:45,P10,"Or you forgot the total. I don't know so it should at least should have the total amount owned owed, and then you enter the amount you want to pay. So having some type of"
00:46:00,P10,"some type of information on the payment page, so so it's easier, I guess."
00:46:09,Emily,"Yeah, okay, got it?"
00:46:10,Emily,"Any? So yeah, that's that's a very good point. Anything else that that could be useful from the app."
00:46:28,P10,"No, I think that's I think that's pretty. That's pretty much all."
00:46:34,P10,Okay. They give you a number at the bottom. Give you the hours you can contact. So.
00:46:40,Emily,Yeah.
00:46:40,P10,And then you're setting the total.
00:46:45,Emily,"Okay, great so we're at time here. I'm gonna check in with my colleague, Natalie. If you have any questions you can unmute and ask, now."
00:46:59,Emily,"okay, that is it for us. So oh, logged off. All right, we're done. There we go."
