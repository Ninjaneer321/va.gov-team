411
0:45:21
P5
You know, above Pdf statements, but below the June 1st Ledger



412
0:45:26

P5
pay bill online would be nice.



413
0:45:29
Emily
Okay, different from where you'd found it before.



414
0:45:34

P5
Correct.



415
0:45:35
Emily
Okay.



416
0:45:37

Emily
Do you know why you would? You would prefer to have it next to Pdf. Statements as as opposed to up top.



417
0:45:48
P5
oh, it's right here. Pay Bill. I some reason I forgot that. No, that I I believe my last. Just take that out pay bills perfect.



418
0:45:55

Emily
Okay, pay Bill got it? And how about to the the information that that you were having to fill in



419
0:46:02
Emily
on the pay.gov.



420
0:46:07

P5
Yeah, just outside of having, like the 5 account number thing or ledger. Everything else is perfect. Just a simple page where I can put my name, my address, maybe my social, and then the amount I want to pay.



421
0:46:19
Emily
Okay. Do you think thoughts on the copying? This account number here.



422
0:46:27

P5
Copy that'd be perfect. I what I would do is just jot it down on a sticky pad, but.



423
0:46:32
Emily
Okay, would you use the the copy action that's here toward the top.



424
0:46:38

P5
I didn't know there wasn't. Oh, I see it! Oh, absolutely! I would.



425
0:46:41
Emily
Okay, thoughts on how to make that more clear.



426
0:46:47

P5
Maybe instead of blue. Make it green.



427
0:46:49
Emily
Okay.



428
0:46:52

P5
Or put copy and paste, or something, because most people



429
0:46:55
P5
I don't know you might mix copay with copy, and your eyes just play that trick on you. Oh, it's missing! Copay.



430
0:47:02

Emily
Okay, so copy could be misread as Cope. I haven't thought about that. Right? Okay.



431
0:47:07
Emily
all right, and go ahead and just tap that I forget. There we go. Okay, yeah. So copy there.



432
0:47:14

Emily
If that if had, had you seen that would, do you think that would be helpful in order to.



433
0:47:20
P5
Barry.



434
0:47:20

Emily
And pay. Yeah, okay, okay, great.



435
0:47:25
Emily
All right. And since you had mentioned the statements, how are are you? Are you currently using any any statements for really any other any anything else in your life?



436
0:47:39

P5
No.



437
0:47:40
Emily
You're not okay, got it.



438
0:47:42

Emily
and let me have you tap on the the current statement here. Since you mentioned that.



439
0:47:52
P5
Perfect.



440
0:47:53

Emily
Okay.



441
0:47:59
Emily
thoughts on, using this this statement within the app.



442
0:48:07

P5
I would use it because I wouldn't want to check out, especially when you start getting into hundreds of dollars. Like.



443
0:48:12
P5
yeah, definitely need the easy access to statements.



444
0:48:15

Emily
Okay, got it



445
0:48:17
Emily
and thoughts on. Would there be anything else you would you would do with them outside of of looking just to to double check all the charges.



446
0:48:27

P5
No, I would just. I would want to just cross reference.



447
0:48:30
Emily
Okay, so he's looking at there. Okay? And then for older ones. Since you mentioned that. What instances would you be looking for older statements?



448
0:48:40

P5
Well, just to double check my math, or to, you know, figure out why that was created. So if you have go to previous statements.



449
0:48:47
P5
Parentheses, Pdf. Would be nice underneath.



450
0:48:50

Emily
Okay, got it. I see. I see. Okay.



451
0:48:54
Emily
And I believe those are all my questions. Natasha, if you have anything just speaking to my other colleague here. If you have anything you wanted to ask, feel free to unmute and ask here.



452
0:49:11

Emily
okay, anything else you would like to share regarding managing finances with Va, or specifically with the app.



453
0:49:21
P5
No, I mean just some more stuff you can put in the app without leaving. The site is easy a lot of times to leave the site. You gotta re log in credentials, and like just to have a face. Id is unbelievable, you know, when I go to my bank account like my chase, app like it, my members, my face id. I don't ever have to use a password like.



454
0:49:41

Emily
Oh, yeah. Okay.



455
0:49:41
P5
For like simplicity. So that's it for me.



456
0:49:46

Emily
Got it great, all right. Well, those are those are all my questions so happy that you were able to to share things with us, always always helpful to speak with veterans of it, helping to to improve things. So hopefully, we'll have some some new improvements soon. And yeah, I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.



457
0:50:11
P5
I hope you have a great weekend, is it? Do you send a is it like a



458
0:50:18

P5
like a gift card link? Or is it via check? I was.



459
0:50:21
Emily
Paragene is going to be reaching out directly to you. I actually don't know the details, but they will be be in touch soon about that.



460
0:50:29

P5
No, I was just curious, but no anything. Yeah, just as simple as possible is what people want, and at least me and then the anything that keeps you from having to log into a government website. But using a government app with the face Id is is a million bucks. In my opinion.



461
0:50:46
Emily
Got it makes sense alright. Well, thank you so much. Hope you have a great weekend.



462
0:50:51

P5
You as well. Thank you, ladies.



463
0:50:53
Emily
Bye.



1
0:00:00

Emily
Have it on record



2
0:00:02
Emily
recorded. So we have it on record that you are okay with this? So now that we are recording, are you okay? If I continue to record the audio and video as we talk today.



3
0:00:13

P6
Yes.



4
0:00:16
Emily
Okay? And would you be okay if I potentially shared any clips from today's session? Excuse me with our Va partners.



5
0:00:25

P6
Yes!



6
0:00:28
Emily
Great. Thank you. So first, st I'd love diving into the conversation. I'd love to know a bit about you as a veteran, at whatever level. You are comfortable. Sharing, of course, could be a branch you served in when you retired or separated.



7
0:00:47

P6
I am a [redacted]. I served 10 years. I left the [redacted] as a [redacted]



8
0:01:01
P6
I separated in 2011 October of 2011



9
0:01:12

P6
And I settled here in [redacted]. I was actually a recruiter here [redacted] for 4 years.



10
0:01:20
P6
And then I separate it from



11
0:01:22

P6
[redacted] as a recruiter. And just stay here in [redacted].



12
0:01:28
Emily
Alright got it? And how about any experience you've had with the Va. What sort of experiences? And have you had.



13
0:01:38

P6
I've had pretty decent experience with the Va.



14
0:01:45
P6
I go to the Va for my my healthcare more recently.



15
0:01:54

P6
Also, I've used I've actually coming out of homelessness myself.



16
0:02:01
P6
So I've also used the different programs for like the veterans housing voucher.



17
0:02:13

Emily
Okay.



18
0:02:13
P6
Choice voucher and



19
0:02:16

P6
and like the case managers and different things like that to help me get back.



20
0:02:22
Emily
Oh, great!



21
0:02:23

P6
To where I was before.



22
0:02:25
Emily
Okay, amazing



23
0:02:28

Emily
and can you tell me what sort of experience you've had with the Va website and or their mobile app.



24
0:02:45
P6
I'm sorry over there, and.



25
0:02:49

Emily
I'm curious to know what sort of experience you've had with the Va website or the mobile app.



26
0:03:02
P6
The the mobile apps and website are, pretty good. The website more so is



27
0:03:12

P6
pretty decent. I've used it for



28
0:03:15
P6
use it for various things like using for like.



29
0:03:21

P6
when I was using my GI Bill for school. I've used it for, of course, like my healthcare



30
0:03:30
P6
communicating with like providers and things like that, ordering prescriptions



31
0:03:37

P6
different things like that same thing with the app



32
0:03:41
P6
as far as the app goes, I think it could be



33
0:03:46

P6
it could use a little bit more. I guess it is.



34
0:03:53
P6
It could stand to grow more



35
0:03:57

P6
have more features added, and things like that.



36
0:04:01
P6
But to make it boring usable and



37
0:04:07

P6
be so, I'll be able to do the same thing. You know, on the go, as I would be able to do on. So the website is pretty good. The mobile app. It's decent enough. But pretty better.



38
0:04:23
Emily
Okay, got it? What? What specific actions do you tend to make on the app as opposed to the website?



39
0:04:32

Emily
Yeah.



40
0:04:35
P6
I'm sorry. What was that?



41
0:04:37

Emily
Oh, what what action? Or when would you choose to use the app over using the website?



42
0:04:45
P6
I mostly use the app for when I'm setting trying to set an appointment with the provider, or just like refilling my prescriptions.



43
0:04:57

P6
or seeing any messages messages I may have from one of the the providers.



44
0:05:07
P6
That's about it.



45
0:05:09

Emily
Okay? And for those, can you tell me why you like using the app better as opposed to the website?



46
0:05:17
P6
Just because it's quicker, is it's quicker to and easier to navigate. I can just get in the app, and you know you is, you know, right there quickly available to get to.



47
0:05:32

Emily
Any, and you said that there the the app could could use some improvement. What? What sorts of things are you thinking that you would prefer to have in the app that just aren't there yet.



48
0:05:47
P6
I would I would say things like



49
0:05:51

P6
like, if I like. Add add things such as the



50
0:05:57
P6
You know the education piece like, you know, using your Gi bill, or you know the stuff that you have to go through for using that



51
0:06:08

P6
also.



52
0:06:12
P6
For things like, if you want to. You know, submit



53
0:06:18

P6
your disability, disability claims and things like that, you can



54
0:06:23
P6
be able to use it doing that versus having to go online added benefit.



55
0:06:32

P6
Things like if you wanted to get updates on. You know, the status of your disability claims something like that.



56
0:06:43
P6
I think various things like that just more added to it than just the medical portion.



57
0:06:48

Emily
Okay. So more than just medical. Okay, got it. Excuse me.



58
0:06:53
Emily
Okay. So now we're going to move into talking about the financial portion of the discussion, and I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have 0 information about you or your finances. So up until now this is all anonymous here 1st have you had experience with owing the Va. Money for any benefit overpayment?



59
0:07:24

Emily
We just lost him.



60
0:07:31
Emily
Shannon. I'll just wait a moment to see I know the reception seemed to be not the greatest on his end, so



61
0:07:40

Emily
maybe he's having a little trouble.



62
0:08:13
Emily
There we go it coming in now.



63
0:08:27

Emily
No, dropped again just after, I admitted. Let's see if he comes back.



64
0:08:34
Emily
There we go. Okay, here we go.



65
0:08:48

Emily
You able to hear me again.



66
0:08:50
Emily
You're on mute.



67
0:08:50

Emily
Oh, there you go! Yeah.



68
0:08:54
P6
Sorry. I'm not sure what happened.



69
0:08:56

Emily
Okay, I just figured it was some kind of connection drop, you know, that happens with technology. Sometimes like, we'll just wait. And hopefully, you're able to join again. So happy you are back.



70
0:09:07
Emily
So the I'll just repeat the question, because I don't know when exactly you dropped. Yeah, curious to know if you have had experience with owing the Va. Money for any overpay or benefit overpayment.



71
0:09:23

P6
Yes, I do. Did do



72
0:09:27
P6
I had an overpayment with my gi bill



73
0:09:36

P6
for some courses I took. I think I ended up drop dropping my course early.



74
0:09:45
P6
And I ended up owing the Va. For



75
0:09:50

P6
for that that portion that I dropped.



76
0:09:53
Emily
Yeah, got it? Okay?



77
0:09:54

Emily
And do you recall, how you were notified of this originally.



78
0:10:03
P6
I think I may have received a letter in the mail.



79
0:10:07

Emily
Okay.



80
0:10:10
P6
Yeah, I think it was a letter in the mail.



81
0:10:13

Emily
Okay? And eventually oh, lost him. Again.



82
0:10:33
Emily
go is back.



83
0:10:41

Emily
Hello.



84
0:10:49
Emily
are you able? To hear? Me, now.



85
0:11:05

Emily
are, you able to hear me yet.



86
0:11:11
Emily
I'm not able to hear you. It looks like you're not. You are unmuted.



87
0:11:19

P6
Oh yes!



88
0:11:20
Emily
Oh, I can, all right. I can hear you now.



89
0:11:24

P6
Can you? Can you hear me?



90
0:11:25
Emily
Yeah, I can right now. Yes, oh, no! Lost again.



91
0:11:54

Emily
Here we go. Is returned.



92
0:12:02
P6
No, okay. So what? It was right now.



93
0:12:05

Emily
Sounds like you're back.



94
0:12:09
P6
Yeah.



95
0:12:13

P6
Okay.



96
0:12:15
P6
Alright.



97
0:12:16

Emily
You, you're able to hear me. Excuse me, are you able to hear me?



98
0:12:20
P6
Yes.



99
0:12:20

Emily
Okay. Great great



100
0:12:24
Emily
Where did I leave off there? Oh, okay. So you were explaining the overpayment debt, and you had received a letter. Do you recall? What are, how you're notified of exactly how you needed to to pay off or or resolve the debt.



101
0:12:47

P6
It was explained in a letter.



102
0:12:51
P6
How we either I could repay the deck. Let me just flat out, I think also.



103
0:13:01

P6
it may have been like a some type of payment option.



104
0:13:05
P6
Okay.



105
0:13:07

P6
payment plan option. And I think there was an also option to dispute the to dispute the debt.



106
0:13:15
Emily
Hmm, okay.



107
0:13:17

P6
Something.



108
0:13:18
Emily
Okay, got it? And oh, excuse me



109
0:13:23

Emily
Do you recall? Were were you? Were you making payments on this, or were you resolving it other ways.



110
0:13:34
P6
Well, at the time I just I didn't have the funds to



111
0:13:40

P6
hated it so kind of just let it



112
0:13:46
P6
be what it was. Just because I I had so much going on at the time. That that was kind of like my concern.



113
0:13:55

Emily
Hmm, okay. Got it?



114
0:13:58
Emily
Okay, was there. Overall. How was the the communication from? Va in terms of



115
0:14:07

Emily
yeah. How? How how? How well did they communicate everything?



116
0:14:14
P6
As far as like



117
0:14:18

P6
the the letter, I mean, and how I resolved it, and everything. That was pretty clear and laid out. I also saw the same thing



118
0:14:29
P6
eventually, later down down the line on on the website.



119
0:14:35

P6
I'm not sure is I kind of ran into it by accident when I was just kind of like going through the website. And it explains it the same, pretty much the same type of way.



120
0:14:46
P6
So I mean, it's pretty clear to explain the debt, and you know how to resolve it, and things like that.



121
0:14:55

Emily
Okay. Great and was there anything that could have been made easier with the whole? With with everything, with with the communication, any sort of options.



122
0:15:10
P6
I would say.



123
0:15:15

P6
I don't know, I guess. Probably like before you know.



124
0:15:19
P6
a debt like that happens, you know.



125
0:15:22

P6
there being like some form of



126
0:15:25
P6
explanation or some type of you know something that would tell me like, you know, if you drop a class at this point in time. Then this is what you may owe something something like that.



127
0:15:38

Emily
Yeah.



128
0:15:40
Emily
okay. And then thoughts on how you want to, how you might want to receive, like a communication like that of of letting you know that if you do this step it may lead to deaths.



129
0:15:56

P6
Preferably electronic, like, I think



130
0:16:00
P6
most communication nowadays is electronic versus paper. A lot of times I get paper mail, and it just ends up being junk mail or something like that. So



131
0:16:14

P6
I'll usually.



132
0:16:16
P6
I usually check my emails and things like that before I would, you know, go through paper mail, because usually paper mail ends up just being



133
0:16:24

P6
junk mail and I try to, you know. Make sure. I select



134
0:16:30
P6
electronic options on everything I do, so I can keep up with things. But



135
0:16:38

P6
Sometimes that's not always an option.



136
0:16:40
Emily
Okay, yeah. Got it.



137
0:16:42

Emily
And have you also had any experience with medical copayment through? Va.



138
0:16:51
P6
Yes, that. More recently.



139
0:16:56

P6
Because before I wasn't using the Va because I wasn't aware that, you know, I was able to use the Va



140
0:17:06
P6
so I was. I had my own insurance prior to that through my employer.



141
0:17:15

P6
And I'm so I'm sorry I lost track of what I was saying.



142
0:17:20
Emily
Oh, I I there's just a general what experience you've had with medical co-payments, which sounds like you. Just you just answered, so yeah. And so,



143
0:17:31

Emily
oh, yeah, go ahead.



144
0:17:33
P6
Oh, yeah. So now then, I real. And then I started receiving mail paper mail saying that I had to pay a co-pay. And I'm like, Okay, well, I wasn't aware of that. And you know, at the time I didn't have



145
0:17:51

P6
income at the time. And So



146
0:17:58
P6
then, when they said I had, I had co-pays to pay, then I had to go back. And they said, There's ways you can, basically



147
0:18:07

P6
You.



148
0:18:14
Emily
Stopped again.



149
0:19:10

Emily
Great coming in now.



150
0:19:39
Emily

155
0:19:53

Emily

156
0:20:37
Emily
Hello.



157
0:20:39

159
0:20:49

Emily
So sorry. What was that?



160
0:20:51
P6
I say, my Internet connection was fine all morning until it this time.



161
0:20:56

Emily
And so when? Yeah, yeah, that. Well, you know, technology likes to likes to mess with us sometimes. I've certainly certainly had that. Oh, there we go again.



162
0:21:43
Emily
You hear me? Okay.



163
0:21:45

P6
Oh yes!



164
0:21:46
Emily
Alright.



165
0:21:48

Emily
Okay. So with okay, with copays and so how have you been notified? When when you had gotten copays?



166
0:21:57
Emily
Oh, no!



167
0:22:38

Emily
Are you able to hear me? I see a frozen screen on your end.



168
0:22:43
P6
Hello!



169
0:22:46

Emily
I heard a little bit, but not much just now.



170
0:23:53
Emily
Shannon, any thoughts on your end. I'm wondering if it might be better to



171
0:23:59

Emily
cancel just we haven't been able to talk more than like a minute at a time.



172
0:24:04
Notetaker
Unfortunately, at this time, because of the length that they've already been on the call. They're already considered complete.



173
0:24:11

Notetaker
So if you wanna stay on and still get little pieces of information, we can.



174
0:24:17
Emily
Sure. Yeah.



175
0:24:18

Notetaker
So it's really up to you. If we want to just keep letting him get on and then get one question at a time.



176
0:24:26
Emily
Yeah.



177
0:24:26

Notetaker
That'd be good to have him not turn on his camera, because when he hasn't turned on his camera he's been on longer.



178
0:24:33
Emily
Yeah, yeah, I I think you're right there. Yeah, I I'm gonna



179
0:24:39

Emily
share my screen to have him so that he's not also sharing his screen, and hopefully, that will help things.



180
0:24:47
Notetaker
I was gonna suggest that as well.



181
0:24:50

Emily
Yes, yes, you've read my mind. If he's a okay, he's admitting, admit him back again.



182
0:24:57
Emily
Just need to log on to zoom on my phone.



183
0:25:42

Emily
Are you able to hear me yet?



184
0:25:56
Emily
If you're able to turn off your camera? That might



185
0:26:01

Emily
might help a little bit if you're able to do that.



186
0:26:06
P6
Oh, I'm sorry I missed that.



187
0:26:08

Emily
Oh, say, well, it it looks like your camera's off. But just in case it's not off. Yeah, why don't you go ahead and turn off your camera, and hopefully, that will make things a little better.



188
0:26:19
P6
I hope so.



189
0:26:20

Emily
Yeah, I know.



190
0:26:26
Emily
If you keep on a little longer I'll wait till that is off.



191
0:27:10

Emily
It looks like you're back on. I'm not seeing is your? Is your camera off now? Just wanna make sure.



192
0:27:18
P6
Yes.



193
0:27:18

Emily
Okay, great. Alright. So we'll keep that off.



194
0:27:22
Emily
And hopefully, it'll work to keep that a little longer. Hopefully, technology will will work in our favor a little bit.



195
0:27:31

Emily
so the I do want to. I don't think I heard an answer, or maybe it was when you would logged off but for the co-pay bills. How had you know, or how? How were you



196
0:27:46
Emily
told that you that you had these to pay.



197
0:27:50

P6
I received a letter in the mail.



198
0:27:55
Emily
Okay.



199
0:27:57

P6
And once I saw the letter. It kind of explained the same way



200
0:28:04
P6
as the the other deck did as far as how to go about.



201
0:28:11

P6
You know, taking care of that debt.



202
0:28:16
P6
And it also had, like an option that that if I had like financial difficulty, or something that like that



203
0:28:24

P6
that I could use that as well.



204
0:28:27
P6
Okay.



205
0:28:29

P6
In addition to that, they were going by my, like, my previous year's income, or something like that.



206
0:28:39
P6
So they didn't have like an updated like financial.



207
0:28:44

P6
I guess updated financial information.



208
0:28:48
Emily
Okay.



209
0:29:14

Emily
Alright. Looks like you're back. Let me know if you can hear me.



210
0:29:17
P6
Oh yes!



211
0:29:18

Emily
Okay? Great. Yeah. So last year that it turned out they didn't have your updated income information. And that. And that's that's when I lost you.



212
0:29:29
P6
Right? So I could submit like a new financial, new financial information or updated financial information.



213
0:29:39

P6
And then that way.



214
0:29:43
P6
I could clear the debt that way as well, because they would have updated information. So I wouldn't be



215
0:29:49

P6
required to pay the co-pay based off of my new financial information.



216
0:29:54
Emily
Oh, got it? Okay, got it? And then any thoughts on how that whole process, specifically regarding the co-pays, might have been made any easier for you.



217
0:30:12

P6
I guess.



218
0:30:14
P6
I mean it was pretty laid out, and everything. Again. It's 1 of those things you don't know until you know the situation happens that



219
0:30:24

P6
you're gonna I will copay. So I mean, if there was something ahead of time like saying.



220
0:30:31
P6
You know, when you visit. Va



221
0:30:36

P6
kind of like knowing ahead of time what to expect.



222
0:30:43
P6
actually visiting a gang hadn't been before, so there was like something



223
0:30:49

P6
some type of. I don't know



224
0:30:54
P6
something ahead of time that can to explain to you how the the process works. Once you start using the Va hospital system.



225
0:31:03

P6
That would have been helpful.



226
0:31:06
Emily
Okay, makes sense.



227
0:31:09

Emily
Okay? So I'm I'm gonna switch things around. I, originally was, gonna have you share your screen. But looking at what technology is doing? I'm actually gonna share my screen. So it's gonna be a little bit different. I'm gonna have you look at a prototype from my phone. So give me just a moment. I've been setting things up screen



228
0:31:34
Emily
oops.



229
0:31:46

Emily
Alright. So here is my screen here, and give me just a moment.



230
0:31:53
Emily
Alright! Are you able to see a pretend app on your phone? Now?



231
0:32:09

Emily
I want I wasn't able to hear. And are you? Are you? Are you able to see the the pretend app on your phone now.



232
0:32:16
P6
Yes!



233
0:32:17

Emily
Okay. Great. Okay, so I'm not. This is only gonna be you looking and and talking out loud. Since this won't be anything that you're actually using. So this is the your pretend va app here? So if you may look familiar, since I know you said you you did have the Va app



234
0:32:40
Emily
But if you were going here first, st where be? Where would you expect to find



235
0:32:50

Emily
Oh, we just lost him again



236
0:32:55
Emily
back.



237
0:33:05

Emily
Okay, are you able to hear me now?



238
0:33:07
P6
Yes.



239
0:33:08

Emily
Great. Okay? So, looking at this this pretend app, where would you expect to find information on like medical copays and overpayments if you were looking here.



240
0:33:22
P6
I would say the bottom right where it says payments.



241
0:33:27

Emily
Okay, got it?



242
0:33:29
Emily
And is there any way that that could? Obviously you went straight there? But thoughts on the title of that, it being named payment would be there be anything else that might be more clear.



243
0:33:50

P6
I mean payment works, but



244
0:33:58
P6
maybe something different if it because it's



245
0:34:02

P6
more so geared towards, you know. The I'm guessing overpayments, or something like that.



246
0:34:13
P6
So maybe I'm not sure.



247
0:34:17

Emily
Okay? Good. Alright. So since, yeah, that's fine. So I'm gonna tap into payments there since you mentioned that and so this is actually the I'll just scroll down. But this is this is the whole, the whole thing right here. And then thoughts on what you are looking at in terms of clarity on what you're seeing.



248
0:34:46
P6
Think I'm waiting for the next you.



249
0:35:17

Emily
Okay? So yeah, so thoughts on on what you're seeing. So this is me tapping into payments. Just like you expected thoughts thoughts on what you're seeing here, knowing that you've got



250
0:35:31
Emily
both copays and overpayments.



251
0:35:36

P6
Okay? Yeah. Now I see it this way. It makes



252
0:35:41
P6
more. Says that. Why, it says payments. Because it's you know payment



253
0:35:50

P6
to a person, and also anything that they may always will be payments that back to the Va or due to the Va.



254
0:36:01
P6
okay, yeah.



255
0:36:02

P6
It makes more sense. Now.



256
0:36:04
Emily
Oh, okay, got it since you said it makes more sense now. What could have made it even easier before?



257
0:37:33

Emily
Okay, you able to hear me now.



258
0:37:37
P6
Yes.



259
0:37:38

Emily
So yeah, if if there, let's know any any thoughts since you said it, it makes sense. Now that you're here, that that label of payments. If there's anything that could have made it even more clear.



260
0:37:56
P6
I don't know. Maybe a a



261
0:38:00

P6
instead of the title being payment, something like.



262
0:39:38
Emily
You. You're kind of just you're about to tell me any ideas you had for a different name for this section that is, payments.



263
0:39:49

P6
I would say. Probably I would use maybe financials or something like that. Purchase payments.



264
0:40:01
Emily
Okay.



265
0:40:05

P6
Yeah.



266
0:40:06
Emily
Yeah, no, that's great. Thank you. Okay. So now, I'm gonna



267
0:40:11

Emily
Go into the overpayments here. So I'm going to tap into overpayment debts. Here, we're gonna get to this section. So thoughts on the clarity of what you're seeing here.



268
0:40:28
Emily
Scroll down just a little bit



269
0:40:32

Emily
really on on like what information you would want to know for each of these debts, that in this pretend situation you owe.



270
0:40:51
P6
Don't see that screen yet.



271
0:40:53

Emily
Oh, okay, and I will wait.



272
0:40:58
Emily
What what are you seeing now? Is it blank or something?



273
0:41:02

P6
No, it's just. It's still in the payments screen.



274
0:41:07
P6
with payments to you and your Va. Debt and bills.



275
0:41:11

Emily
Oh, interesting! It's a little little slow to catch up, all right.



276
0:41:17
Emily
See? I'm actually gonna jump ahead.



277
0:41:20

Emily
Let me know when you so I've just switched it to a screen that says, dropped again.



278
0:41:37
Notetaker
You might want to switch back to the other screen. So when he jumps on he sees that previous screen first.st



279
0:41:43

Emily
Yeah, it's a good one.



280
0:41:45
Emily
Thank you.



281
0:42:01

Emily
Be coming back in



282
0:43:06
Emily
bidding again.



283
0:43:15

Emily
Keeps dropping after I hit, admit. Unfortunately.



284
0:43:35
Emily
Okay, let me know what are you seeing on screen right now? What page.



285
0:43:45

P6
Still loading right now.



286
0:43:47
Emily
Loading all right.



287
0:44:01

P6
No.



288
0:44:02
Emily
Is it like a little the little spinning wheel sort of thing.



289
0:44:06

P6
Yeah.



290
0:44:08
Emily
Okay, gotta love that one. I've experienced that plenty. Of course



291
0:44:14

Emily
I'll I'll just wait till it it. It show the the screen itself shows up on your end. Then I just had



292
0:44:21
Emily
couple other questions.



293
0:44:50

P6
Now, I'm sure, for the rest of the day I won't have any other problems.



294
0:44:53
Emily
I know right.



295
0:44:55

P6
Smooth.



296
0:44:56
Emily
After that, just not the 1 h really trying to right.



297
0:45:01

Emily
That's always the way I know.



298
0:45:06
Emily
So is it? Is it? Still thinking about showing you an image.



299
0:45:11

P6
Yeah.



300
0:45:12
Emily
Okay. Well, let me. I'll just ask a couple of questions while that is going. If we get to it cool. If not, that is totally fine. When so I know you said when you had received the letter for the overpayment, the benefit overpayment lost again.



301
0:46:00

Emily
Not if it'll help, but I'm gonna attempt to



302
0:46:04
Emily
stop sharing on my end. I wonder



303
0:46:11

Emily
if he gets back on? I'll try sharing again



304
0:46:15
Emily
when in doubt restart things. That's how I the only way I know how to fix things



305
0:46:27

Emily
coming in again.



306
0:46:57
Emily
All right. I stopped my screen. Share my my hope is that



307
0:47:02

Emily
maybe I'll try again. See if it works. Are you able to hear me and see my video first? st



308
0:47:08
P6
I can hear you.



309
0:47:10

Emily
Okay, but it's not showing any any video at all.



310
0:47:16
P6
No.



311
0:47:17

Emily
Okay, all right, then we'll just. We'll just skip that. I'll ask. Ask a couple more questions. So I know you said when you received the letter for the benefit overpayment? And it there were options listed.



312
0:47:32
Emily
I think you said like for general help. If you need help, repay payment plan things like that. Do you recall when you 1st started getting the bills for Copays? Was there something similar for options in case you're not able to pay, and things like that.



313
0:47:50

P6
Yes, there was



314
0:47:52
P6
It had like



315
0:47:54

P6
similar options. As far as you know, ways. I could resolve the debt. I could just pay pay the bill or make payments, or I could dispute it



316
0:48:06
P6
and then the other thing about the financial my own financial



317
0:48:14

P6
situation as far as what they were going off versus what my actual current



318
0:48:21
P6
financial situation was at the time.



319
0:48:26

Emily
And was that so? I know you said you learned that they had outdated information. Did you know that from those 1st letters about the Copay bills? Or did that come later? That discovery.



320
0:48:39
P6
Oh!



321
0:49:11

Emily
Yeah, they add, I'm not sure if when you cut out but at least I the last question I'd asked was



322
0:49:18
Emily
when when it when you discovered that they had outdated information for your income was that at this did you learn that at the same time that you were 1st receiving these Copay bills? Or did that come later?



323
0:49:32

P6
I believe that came later with me kind of like putting



324
0:49:36
P6
putting different pieces together. And then I kinda like.



325
0:49:42

P6
realize that later. That they were going by like you know what I was



326
0:49:49
P6
previously making like the previous year, or whatever



327
0:49:53

P6
so kind of like, went back and like, Hey.



328
0:49:56
P6
thinking like, Oh, this isn't right. Financial information.



329
0:50:03

P6
and then I had to go dig a little bit more to find out that you could submit a new financial



330
0:50:10
P6
I guess, like a financial report of what you're making, and then that will better reflect of. You know my current situation.



331
0:50:18

Emily
Hmm, okay. Got it



332
0:50:20
Emily
under the when you discover was that was that over over the phone. I forget how you how you made that discovery.



333
0:50:29

P6
That was through the website, kind of like.



334
0:50:35
P6
just piecing different pieces together from what I got received.



335
0:50:40

Emily
Hmm.



336
0:51:09
P6
Oh!



337
0:51:12

Emily
Yeah, yeah.



338
0:51:13
Emily
I last heard you were, you were piecing together the information with things you found on the website was that I want to make sure I got that right.



339
0:51:22

P6
Yes, so basically, like when I was when it was basically showing, telling me from the letter how I could.



340
0:51:29
P6
you know



341
0:51:32

P6
dispute the debt or something like that. Then I learned that they go off like financial information. And so then from there, I kinda like.



342
0:51:42
P6
learn that you can actually update your financial information



343
0:51:49

P6
through another part of the website.



344
0:51:52
P6
And then by updating that, I kind of figured out like, when I update this, then I can dispute it better because my information will be updated. Financial will be updated.



345
0:52:05

Emily
Okay. So so then you would, you would update it all.



346
0:52:13
P6
Yes.



347
0:52:14

Emily
Okay, got it. And is that something? So I know you said you were on the website. Is that? Oh, lost again.



348
0:52:28
Emily
I go ask the one more question I was about to ask, and then wrap up, because it's only it's about 3 of here it comes



349
0:52:48

Emily
alright.



350
0:52:50
Emily
Okay. So you said you had. You had updated things on the website. And is that so that that financial update since we talked about, you wanted to have more things in the app. Is that something you would have wanted to do in the app.



351
0:53:09

P6
That would definitely be beneficial.



352
0:53:12
Emily
Okay.



353
0:53:43

Emily
okay, so last year, did, it would be beneficial to have that app of updating your financial information. I'd love to know why, why you would you you would have preferred to do it in the app, or you would have liked to do it in the app.



354
0:53:59
P6
Just because, like



355
0:54:04

P6
hopefully, it would be tied into that, you know, payments or whatever section you want to call it that way. You kinda



356
0:54:13
P6
know, ahead of time that you know that



357
0:54:16

P6
all that stuff is kind of like tied together. All that goes together is as one piece how they're determining your copayments based off your you know your whatever, your fine, your own financial information, as far as your income and things like that.



358
0:54:37
P6
That way. I don't have to go



359
0:54:40

P6
kind of like searching around myself and figuring it out by myself is kind of like



360
0:54:45
P6
it will be laid out together.



361
0:54:47

Emily
Okay, so everything together. Okay, got it great. Well, we are at time. And Nope logged out again.



362
0:54:54
Emily
I want to say goodbye, and then we'll wrap up hopefully. He comes back.



363
0:55:15

Emily
You able to hear me yet.



364
0:55:17
P6
Yes.



365
0:55:18

Emily
I was about to wrapping up. But yeah, I really appreciate you taking the time. I'm sorry technology was not was not working in our favor today. But like you said, it'll probably work great for the rest of the day, but we certainly got got some good information. It's always good to talk with our veterans. Just to understand experiences and what works and what does not work. So I appreciate you taking the time. And I hope you have a great rest of your day.



366
0:55:46
P6
Thank you. And I'm so sorry about my my technology. And I hope you all have a great rest of your day as well.



367
0:55:55

Emily
Great. Thank you. Take care!



368
0:55:57
P6
Thank you.



1
0:00:00

Emily
Recording.



2
0:00:02
Emily
There we go. So just to confirm, are you okay? If I record the audio and video as we talk today.



3
0:00:09

P7
Yes, I'm perfectly fine. Yeah.



4
0:00:11
Emily
Great. Thank you. And would you? Okay, with potentially showing our Va partners some clips from today's session.



5
0:00:19

P7
Yeah, that's perfectly fine.



6
0:00:20
Emily
Okay, great. Thank you. Okay. So on to oh, excuse me. First, st I'd like to know? Just a little bit about yourself as a veteran. What branch were you serving in when when you retired or separated.



7
0:00:36

P7
I really need to disclose all the information.



8
0:00:40
Emily
Oh, sorry! Sorry! I wasn't quite hearing that.



9
0:00:43

P7
Oh, I mentioned no! Do I really need to disclose all of that? I don't feel comfortable.



10
0:00:48
Emily
Okay, got it? Okay? Sure, no problem.



11
0:00:50

Emily
Okay. And then excuse me. At whatever level you're comfortable. What sort of experience have you had with Va. In terms of any sort of if you've gone to any any buildings or any sort of use on the website, or app.



12
0:01:05
P7
Yeah, I think everything. So far I've had. I've had a good experience for the most part. I think that sometimes it's like, it's very stressful, a lot of the, for example, the medical benefits. It's like very straightforward. They're really clear. I think maybe on the when it comes to the finance side. That's where I find that maybe I might be struggling a little bit with, and I think that's where probably



13
0:01:34

P7
looking for the most guidance.



14
0:01:38
Emily
Okay, got it?



15
0:01:40

Emily
Excuse me, and are you? Are you often or, ever on the va website and or the mobile app.



16
0:01:48
P7
I am on, especially on the mobile, on the mobile app.



17
0:01:53

Emily
Okay, yeah.



18
0:01:54
Emily
and are there. So are you? Are you only on the mobile app, or occasionally on the website as well.



19
0:02:00

P7
Also on the website. I think maybe the way my brain works is that sometimes when I'm dealing with finances, I think I need to work out my laptop. I think I find myself that because it's a serious interaction I'm gonna be engaging with. I think I need my laptop. So when it comes to like anything, finance, debt related. That's when I would use my laptop for the most part.



20
0:02:26
Emily
Okay, finance and lots of got it. In. In what cases would you choose to use the mobile app over the website?



21
0:02:34

P7
The mobile app. I think I found myself when I'm just like checking, like you know, any benefits, or I think, especially if I need to book any medical appointments prescriptions. That sort of thing. I gravitate. I see. I gravitate myself to just like picking up my phone and doing that.



22
0:02:55
Emily
Okay, got it? Great.



23
0:02:56

Emily
Okay? So we're going to be moving on to the financial portion. So I want to make sure that you're only sharing what you are willing. I have 0 information as to any sort of financial information records with you, so I only know what you would you choose to share.



24
0:03:14
Emily
So first, st we're going to be talking about both a little bit of medical Copays and or benefit overpayment, 1st wondering if you've had experience with owing the Va. Money.



25
0:03:30

P7
Yes, I do. I think I think at some point I fell behind on certain payments. And yeah, I was trying to maybe find a way to just let you know. Repay that. But I did. I did fall behind in that regard.



26
0:03:44
Emily
Okay, you got a 5 pm, do you recall? Exactly how or when? Oh, yeah. More how you were you. You were notified of the money that you had to pay.



27
0:03:56

P7
I was notified through a letter. So I think this is when it comes to. I think I think it becomes more top of mind when I receive a paper letter. And that's how I would get my notifications. I don't think I feel comfortable doing paperless, so that's what I prefer just getting a paper letter.



28
0:04:15
Emily
Oh, oh, you're not! You're you said you're you're not comfortable, doing paperless.



29
0:04:18

P7
Yeah, I think I find myself. Maybe I might distract, or sometimes I find them a little. I might miss them, or hard or it's a bit hard for me to find them. I think maybe I forget that I get that notification. Maybe so. I prefer getting them on on an actual, you know, envelope like snail mail.



30
0:04:39
Emily
Got it?



31
0:04:39

P7
It's top of mind. Yeah.



32
0:04:40
Emily
Okay, you prefer to get all right. Got it? And then what is or what? What prompts you to make payment, or like. How how do you know when you may need to make a payment.



33
0:04:53

P7
I think what I do. I just set myself up, either on a weekend just set aside some time just to go through my mail. And that's when I was like, okay, I think I could make the payment this time around at least a minimum and that's what I know I would I would describe some time. So a lot of manual stuff.



34
0:05:17
Emily
Okay, so you're covering your time. And do you are you getting a letter each time you have to pay? Or is it less frequent than that.



35
0:05:26

P7
I definitely get letters. When it comes to copayments. Frequently. So so yeah, it's like, no regardless like or treatment. I will get a letter. And that's when I would know that. Okay, I need to make a co-payment. Or if there's anything outside of that, I need to pay.



36
0:05:47
Emily
Okay, got it. And then how about? And for outside of of copayments, if there's any debt that you have, is that something you're you're receiving every time you need to make a payment, or less frequently.



37
0:05:59

P7
I think I think it's less frequently. I think maybe I probably get that letter. Maybe probably about I will say maybe quarterly, maybe every 3, every 3 or 4 months I would get a reminder that, hey, you have this like outstanding balance? Yeah.



38
0:06:18
Emily
Okay, got it. And with that, so with the ones that you get quarterly, are you? Are you making payments more often than that? Or are you making the payments quarterly when you receive the letters.



39
0:06:29

P7
I think, I think when I get the letter quarterly, that's when I know, okay, I'm I need to make a payment. I think, yeah.



40
0:06:38
Emily
Got it all right. And thoughts on. If there are any ways that things could be made easier in regards to any like having having to make the payments either for the the debt or for the medical co-payments.



41
0:06:56

P7
I think I think when it comes to medical Co payments for the most part. That's something, I think, because it happens more frequently. I'm on top of it a lot more, I think, when it comes up any debt outside of that.



42
0:07:09
P7
Sometimes I'm looking for, maybe, like, you know, if maybe down the line. I could get some kind of just like, you know, option where maybe some of the debt might be forgiven, or or or or to work out some kind of like, you know, plan where? Yeah. Like, you know, I could



43
0:07:27

P7
of.



44
0:07:28
P7
They make those payments much more doable for me.



45
0:07:33

Emily
Okay? And is there? What sort of communication is there now in regards to helping to make these payments more doable?



46
0:07:41
P7
So far, so far, just. The correspondence I received is just like this is your outstanding balance, and this is how like you know the payments that you should be making and so I've tried to adhere to them as much as possible.



47
0:07:56

Emily
okay, so so right now, it sounds like, there's there's not any communication, in regards to making anything easier to pay is that right.



48
0:08:03
P7
Yeah, I think so far, I that I remember, you know.



49
0:08:08

Emily
Got it.



50
0:08:09
Emily
and then thinking of both the copayments and the the debts. I know you said the copayments you're receiving fairly often, and then the debt you're receiving less often, maybe quarterly. How are you? Are you thinking of those as being similar types of money that you pay, or different? Or I'm wondering how you categorize those in your head.



51
0:08:37

P7
Yeah, I think of anything when I when I look at medical payments, because it involves my health and well being and I think just because of the frequency of the reminders, and because I think I just see them on my app.



52
0:08:53
P7
on my, on my phone, I think they become very much top of mind priority. That sort of sense. And I think, for, like any outstanding balance, I think it's more just like I know that. I need to make those payments. But I think just like, because of my income and everything. I think it's just



53
0:09:16

P7
adds that stress. And so I just wait for that letter to arrive. Just so. Yeah, just have to make that payment. But I think that's how pretty much just like, you know. Ensuring that I'm taking care of myself physically and mentally. Once.



54
0:09:35
Emily
Hmm, okay, got it? Got it?



55
0:09:37

Emily
Okay? I'm gonna have you? We're gonna move on to some screen share and eventually get to the prototype. Could I have you share your screen now, and let me know if you need help making that happen?



56
0:09:52
P7
Let's see.



57
0:10:03

Emily
All right sharing screen. That was nice and easy. I love that.



58
0:10:06
P7
Yeah.



59
0:10:07

Emily
And now let me have you open up the figma app that you had downloaded.



60
0:10:15
Emily
and I'm going to give you a login in just a moment. There we go, all right. And so so oh, yeah, they're just about to say you can swipe my video out of the way you read my mind.



61
0:10:23

P7
At least I'm tech savvy? Somewhat.



62
0:10:26
Emily
Perfect, easy peasy. So let me have you go to log into figma. And I'm going to give you some credentials here.



63
0:10:36

Emily
Okay, so the email is VA test 0 0@gmail.com.



64
0:10:48
P7
Okay.



65
0:10:49

Emily
And the password VAVA. VAVA.



66
0:10:54
Emily
There is a minimum of 8 characters.



67
0:10:57

P7
Oh, it's 8 characters. Okay?



68
0:10:59
P7
Oh.



69
0:11:03

Emily
Yes, all right. And then it's just gonna prompt me for a code. Okay, there we go. That's coming through. So let me have you type in 4, 7, 0



70
0:11:14
Emily
3, 9, 4, 3.



71
0:11:20

Emily
Okay. Now, let's hopeful. This works continue with mobile app.



72
0:11:27
Emily
All right. So I'm going to give you a link. Give me just a moment.



73
0:11:33

Emily
I will do so in the zoom chat. Okay. Just sent that from into the Zoom chat.



74
0:11:45
P7
okay.



75
0:11:47

Emily
Yeah, the extra. There we go.



76
0:11:51
Emily
Okay, hopefully, that comes out. It's working. I like, when things start working.



77
0:11:58

Emily
Oh, that was faster than than normal. I like it all right. So here we have the fake app home screen. So before I have you tap on anything just looking at this and pretending this was you opening up your mobile app thoughts on where you might find money that you owe, and this could be both the debts and the copayments.



78
0:12:25
P7
Yeah, I think opening this app.



79
0:12:30

P7
I think if anything I would probably look at maybe I would probably check messages just to see if I had any notifications regarding any of those outstanding debts, or if that were empty, then I will tap on payments at the bottom, right.



80
0:12:52
Emily
Okay. Got it. Thoughts on that payments that you mentioned in terms of the title. How clear or not clear might that be as a place to find that information.



81
0:13:04

P7
I think it's I think it's clear enough. I think. I'm inclined to have. Maybe payments might be anything I might be receiving. But then that's why the benefits tab is there? I think payments is very clear enough.



82
0:13:22
Emily
Okay, got it? Any thoughts on any title that might be even more clear.



83
0:13:28

P7
I think maybe I think maybe either maybe payments, or maybe if I provide something that says balance, or just maybe just just straightforward to it, just like outstanding balance. Would be great. Just so like I know exactly where that option is.



84
0:13:49
Emily
Okay, got it? Alright, and since you mentioned the payments, let me have you go ahead and tap into payments.



85
0:13:58

Emily
Okay? So now that you're seeing this screen again, I'll ask you any thoughts, especially knowing that this is called Payments thoughts on the information that you're seeing here in terms of the clarity of calling it payments.



86
0:14:14
P7
Yeah, in terms of payments. Payment history to you. Yeah, I think it's very straightforward. I like it. I like how it's



87
0:14:26

P7
quickly. Just categorize into 2 separate boxes if you will, maybe payments to you. So that makes sense that anything that I'm receiving from the Va, and then any debt that I have. That oh, to the Va, so so yeah, I think it's very. I think it's very clear. And understandable. Yeah.



88
0:14:53
Emily
Yeah, great. And then how about the the brief bit of information that is below both overpayment debt and copays the amount. And then how many debts or bills? What other are? Is there other information you might want to know, just as a super high level from this page.



89
0:15:12

P7
No, I think of anything I think of anything. Maybe I'd be curious to know if



90
0:15:20
P7
if maybe they could separate debts, or maybe just like if I'm about to click on overpayment, that's it. Maybe there'd be some kind of option to help me pay those make those payments more easier.



91
0:15:39

Emily
Oh, okay. So so, something from this page to to clearly make it easier to make those payments.



92
0:15:44
P7
Yeah, I think maybe it says copays maybe just mentioned, maybe medical Co pays or prescription copays just so. Just so. I know.



93
0:15:55

Emily
Oh, oh, even even more clear! On what type of Copays.



94
0:15:58
P7
Yeah, maybe that. But I but I imagine that maybe if I click on the arrow, maybe it will give me more information. But I think, just like looking at it from an high level. It's it's very understandable. Yeah.



95
0:16:11

Emily
Okay, got it. So first, st we're gonna look just at the the overpayment section and you can tap into anything, scroll around and stuff. But let me let me get a sense of of what you are from this app, like what you believe that you currently owe, according to all this fake data here for specifically for the overpayments.



96
0:16:33
P7
Yeah. So according to the information I'm given, yeah, I owe $2,760. That. Oh, and this is according to here.



97
0:16:50

Emily
Okay and let me have you get even more information on these, just to see how clear everything is laid out.



98
0:16:57
P7
Okay, should I check on the arrow?



99
0:16:59

P7
Yep, yeah. Yeah. It's right on the the overpayment. That's yep.



100
0:17:02
Emily
Yeah. So so again, just yeah, give me a brief overview of just what you're seeing here in terms of clarity, of of how much you owe with with this this fake example. Here.



101
0:17:15

P7
Yeah. So I think here is it shows the 4 debts that are part of that in the payment. I do see here that one of them the post focus. I think it's really it's already been paid for. So that's really out of the picture. But it's nice to have that I think maybe this is a reminder that



102
0:17:41
P7
I was able to make that that, or it's no longer top of mind. But yeah, but everything else. I do see. The balance that I owe and of course I think maybe what I



103
0:17:56

P7
appreciate a little is the the next steps to approach these steps.



104
0:18:08
Emily
Okay, so so since you mentioned next steps, what? And just the the this top one is active here, but what it. What information would be important to you specifically in regards to next steps, that you might have to take.



105
0:18:22

P7
I think maybe I think maybe that's probably what maybe I'm not being fine to click on review details. Like, for example, like the one at the bottom contact the Department of Treasury. If I click on review details, I hope that maybe I'll be given some sort of maybe direct phone number. And I can do like a generic phone number to try to see if I could work that balance out



106
0:18:50
P7
at least, for, like the disability, pension, and compensation and pension that I do see that, for example, at least fair enough. They give me the warning that benefits will be reduced or can be enacted. So yeah, we'll definitely click on review details to see what's gonna be the outcome of that.



107
0:19:13

Emily
Okay. Well, since you said the details, let me have you tap on the details for the top one, the housing one, and let me know if, like, yeah, with the information here, how complete or incomplete is are things here that you would need for your next steps.



108
0:19:34
P7
Let's see.



109
0:19:42

P7
Yeah, I think it's I think it's complete. Enough. I think it's no. I think it's very complete. Yeah. It shows me again, like the the balance that I currently owe. When I need to. Make that payment or give them a call to see if maybe I can work the date out somehow.



110
0:20:05
P7
I do like this signal. Why might I have this that I do like that reminder. So I don't think at least I don't have this



111
0:20:14

P7
thinking that like, where did this come from? At least there's context behind that debt. And then I know I do like the



112
0:20:25
P7
the the history of the payments I've made, and I think if anything, also the the letters I've been receiving. Yeah, I think this is also a a good post that I appreciate.



113
0:20:38

Emily
Okay? Great in regards to the the debt letter history. What are how? How would you use that that section? What? What would be helpful for you right here.



114
0:20:49
P7
I think maybe I think for me it would be just like the the dates. I think maybe that's when I would, you know, at least for me, like well, I can't let this



115
0:21:00

P7
keep just like, you know, snowballing and so I think that, for example, April 1st 2025. It kind of says a mental reminder for me that. Okay, that's when they sent the letter. And I really need to get on on top of this.



116
0:21:16
Emily
Okay, so is, is the the information here sufficient? Seeing exactly the date the letters were.



117
0:21:23

P7
Yeah, I think if anything ever wanted to see the letter, I'd be curious to know if I could like tap on it the 1, st 2025, 1st demand letter and see if the letter will pop up or Pdf of it. But yeah, I think I find this section very helpful.



118
0:21:40
Emily
Okay, great. Got it, and then see what else? Here, if you let's say you did pay this debt off completely, what information would you want to see that that may or may not indicate that.



119
0:21:56

P7
If I pay this debt completely, I think we I think that letter history. I would want maybe some kind of this, like final letter or something indicating that. You're. You know this debt is close and that you've made your final payment.



120
0:22:14
P7
And yeah, and maybe like, no, whether it's in yellow, maybe something in green or a balance of 0, just letting me know that there's no further action or activity required on my end.



121
0:22:27

Emily
Okay, got it? And are there other things that? You know, we're, we're gonna pretend that this is being built in in the app. So about what you're seeing here? Are there other other things that you would expect to be or want to be able to do from here?



122
0:22:47
P7
Yeah, I think if anything, what I'm looking for. Interestingly enough, I'm looking for, maybe like, kind of what banks have like a payment option. So I'm looking for like, oh, I know that I owe in this case 830. I'm I'm looking for a way to, maybe. Okay, well, let's let's make a payment right now. I don't see that. So maybe I'm looking for that. Yeah. Or maybe just because



123
0:23:15

P7
because this because of how much I owe. I'm looking for, maybe just a button or something, just to let me know like, Hey, how can I? Maybe? How can we work something out so that I can continue to make these payments? At a more, maybe tailored approach. Given my income.



124
0:23:38
Emily
Okay. So you you'd want something to to potentially work with you to make the payments and also something to make the payments.



125
0:23:46

P7
Yeah, I know that like no, I don't. I saw the previous option that they had some sort of like, you know, contact us, and we'll work something out or something along those lines. But I don't know, I'm thinking, maybe kind of like



126
0:24:00
P7
kind of like with other apps like or paypal, where you could just automatically, just opt in into maybe a way to consult to maybe break this payments apart or make them more doable. Yeah, I'm kind of looking for that. Maybe like an option. Here.



127
0:24:21

Emily
Okay, got it? Yeah, that makes sense. So noting that you have stated those things that you want that are not here. If this were built in real life, as is without the payment options and without the communication about how how they could they could work with you, how likely would you be to use it as is.



128
0:24:42
P7
I would. I would likely very. I would. I would use it. I think maybe I think maybe it's very. It's very clean. It's very informative. It provides me everything about like, you know the payments that I've made, including any late fees, that sort of nature. So I think with that in mind?



129
0:25:02

P7
Yeah, it would definitely. I would see myself. Adding it to my well, that's maybe being more comfortable. Seeing this on my phone and engaging with it with making payments, or having that in top of mind.



130
0:25:17
Emily
Okay, got it. And I'm gonna so we're gonna get back. Get back to the payments in just a moment. But let me have you go one screen back to the the debts page is one other question I had.



131
0:25:29

Emily
Yeah. So if you were going to pretend that there is a new debt that you have incurred in this in this pretend situation, how would you expect to be notified? Obviously you would. I know you would get the the debt letter, but in terms of the app. How might you expect to to know that that information is in here?



132
0:25:51
P7
Yeah, I think maybe I think if it if if I haven't got the letter, but I know that I owe something, then probably I would go here again under payments, and see if maybe try refreshing the page and see if it's there.



133
0:26:08

P7
or or if it's not there just yet. Then probably I'll just go to my home to the home page. Maybe the bottom left, and I guess wait until I get some kind of push notification or some kind of internal notification, letting me know that where it's gonna be posted, or when it's posted.



134
0:26:30
Emily
Okay, got it.



135
0:26:31

Emily
And all right, let me have you tap on the payment section i'm going to have you and scroll all the way down we're going to get to a little hidden section. The blank gray area below Copays. Go ahead and tap that.



136
0:26:46
P7
Focus, or the blank.



137
0:26:48

Emily
The the blank area that's below. Could the copays?



138
0:26:53
Emily
Yeah, there, perfect. Okay. And let me have you tap into the overpayment debt section again.



139
0:27:00

Emily
All right. So again, we're going to look at this very top one, the housing we're going to pretend that since we've talked about looking to to get help in terms of making different payment structures. What would you want to do if you were looking to make a different payment plan or something for this top on this debt, for housing.



140
0:27:29
P7
Yeah, I think maybe I think if I'm looking for maybe some kind of maybe different option, or maybe a more tailored option. And I would click on or tap on our resolve gap and see if maybe they could provide me with some



141
0:27:47

P7
options where we could have it with no mutual benefit or understanding. Okay.



142
0:27:52
Emily
Okay? Oh, yeah, you can go ahead and do that. Since you mentioned it.



143
0:27:57

P7
Okay?



144
0:27:59
P7
Yeah. So so yeah, I, I like this, like, how? Like, yeah, I can either pay online or other ways to pay. I think maybe I'd be inclined to, by the way, click on other ways to pay. Just so. Maybe it would give like no more options.



145
0:28:18

Emily
Nice.



146
0:28:18
P7
To calculating this debt.



147
0:28:21

Emily
Okay, yeah. Yeah. If you want to go and tap through that, some of these are are actually linked in the prototype here.



148
0:28:27
P7
Okay.



149
0:28:28

P7
Okay. So pay by phone pay by mail.



150
0:28:33
P7
Yeah, give- give them a call.



151
0:28:39

P7
But



152
0:28:43
P7
no, that's.



153
0:28:44

Emily
Information here. Would there be something else you might be looking for?



154
0:28:48
P7
Yeah, I think maybe pay by mail. I think I think I imagine that I thought that I thought that I would be getting. Maybe in my mind I thought that maybe there'd be other options where maybe I can. They can help me with just like, you know. making these payments much more doable. But instead, I got that. What if I can't pay online? Then I could do this



155
0:29:14

P7
pay that post $10, either on the phone or by mail. So I think my mind was just thinking about something else. But yeah.



156
0:29:24
Emily
Okay, I'll have you go ahead and tap close there.



157
0:29:28

Emily
And yeah. Thoughts on what? What would you be? What would you expect to find, under the the request, Help, Button.



158
0:29:38
P7
Request help, I think. I think, initially, I thought that maybe initially, I thought that by tapping on request help. That's when I would anticipate to maybe get a phone number or something to contact them. That's what I initially thought. But now that I see the other ways to pay is going down. That phone number. Then, I imagine, request to help now



159
0:30:03

P7
should be, I hope, ways that maybe I could make these payments much more doable for me.



160
0:30:13
Emily
Okay, yeah. And you can. You can go ahead and tap or request help. And just see how that lines up with what you're expecting.



161
0:30:20

P7
Yeah, yeah, this is exactly what I was. I was looking for initially. Yeah. So I think I think, by the way, I would tap on request a payment plan.



162
0:30:34
P7
just to see like, you know, what options?



163
0:30:37

P7
So



164
0:30:39
P7
so yeah, I think it gives me just like, you know, general information. I think, knowing me either, like, you know, I will try going online and see if I could work something out. Obviously to ask ea otherwise, if I find that tricky or cumbersome, then maybe I'll just give them a call directly



165
0:31:04

P7
and before before I proceed with that? I'll I'll probably also click on and see again. I know what I can do. And I think and I think maybe because he starts to request for that help.



166
0:31:21
P7
I might be inclined to actually tap on that and see if I fit that requirement when it comes to putting out the paperwork and see if I'm eligible for any further help or the legal.



167
0:31:36

Emily
Okay? Yeah, you can go ahead and tap on the the debt relief one and see if if this page looks like it would be, it would be helpful from what we have. And obviously I'm not going to have you read everything but just a quick skim. If this would be be helpful for you if you, if you were for help.



168
0:31:56
P7
Yeah, I think if anything it looks, it looks very promising. Da da da.



169
0:32:03

P7
Yeah, I think if anything



170
0:32:10
P7
request I like how it it kind of it gives you. By the way, the step by step, as like no, what? What information they're gonna need, and the timeline whenever we have time for just the process step by step. I do like. How like they mentioned how long it'll probably take. So I really do appreciate that. Because you never know



171
0:32:34

P7
just like how much time I need to carve out. I anticipated. Maybe I thought that maybe I would just it would just take me 1520 min to submit it. But I do like how they give me the actual timeframe. So that's very helpful and I do like how the start. The request is mentioned at the top and bottom, and it's indicated in green, so I don't know. Maybe just for me. The green just makes me a bit more optimistic.



172
0:33:04
Emily
Okay, great. Let me have you tap on done here on the upper left yep, and then



173
0:33:12

Emily
oh, if in case you or let's say you believe that you don't actually owe this money, this particular debt for housing? Would it be clear what your next steps would be if you don't believe you, you owe this bill. I'm sorry this this debt.



174
0:33:29
P7
Yeah, yeah. So so yeah. So if if I feel that, maybe this was posted by error, or maybe the debt that I owe is higher than what I anticipated. Well, if there's maybe some sort of discrepancy, then yeah, I would click on then I think it would tap on request help.



175
0:33:54

P7
And then I think I saw an option. Yeah, here. So we click on on dispute this, that yeah, I would tap on that start here, that dispute.



176
0:34:05
Emily
Okay, great. I'll have you close this one.



177
0:34:10

Emily
So overall how I know you said when you have received the debt letters in person. There really wasn't any communication in terms of any help you might be able to request overall. How? How have you become aware that it is possible to request help from Va. Or any other resources in that in that sense.



178
0:34:35
P7
Oh, me, personally, I well, I think I think for me personally, maybe just like, you know, going online and maybe doing a quick Google search but I think maybe just for me, maybe, like, you know, I haven't. Maybe you know, had the time, or I really don't know how. Maybe



179
0:34:56

P7
time consuming. That might be, or if it's even worth exploring. So I don't know. Maybe that's why I haven't attack with that, or make that approach but maybe just seeing the options here, like, you know, on this, on this screen, on my phone. I don't know. Maybe just holding in my hands. It kind of gives me a sense of just like it's not.



180
0:35:20
P7
it's it. It could be maybe easier. And maybe I should have done this maybe a while back.



181
0:35:26

Emily
Okay, so you, it sounds like you, you would. You would want more communication just to



182
0:35:31
Emily
just give like laying out options.



183
0:35:35

P7
Yeah.



184
0:35:36
Emily
Okay, got it.



185
0:35:38

Emily
And then we're going to pretend that you are ready to make a payment on this particular debt on this particular debt for the housing. Walk me through how you might, and again, I'm not going to have you enter in any payment information, I promise, but walk me through what your steps would be if you are ready to make a payment through here.



186
0:35:59
P7
Yeah. So I will want to make a payment. I'll probably click on resolve that and then, because yeah, probably



187
0:36:10

P7
how seamless this experience has been. Then I probably click on pay online.



188
0:36:17
P7
Okay. So it provides me with the details. And then from there I would have to click on or tap on pay on pay and I think from there it will just take me to like, you know the other page where I could make the payment.



189
0:36:41

Emily
Okay, let me let me have you tap on that. And again, I'm not gonna have you type in anything real, so you will not make any payments, I promise.



190
0:36:48
Emily
Yeah, you can continue through that to.



191
0:36:51

P7
So if you click on view, let me open here.



192
0:37:01
Emily
So here we have the the and and have you have you encountered this site before?



193
0:37:06

P7
Yes, I have.



194
0:37:07
Emily
Yeah, okay, got it. Okay? So I'm not. Gonna have you read everything? But let me have you just skip right ahead and tap on the the Blue green button on the upper left. I think it says pay online. It's very tiny. I can't actually tell.



195
0:37:21

P7
Yeah, it's yeah. It's.



196
0:37:23
Emily
Yeah, line. There we go. Yeah, okay. And then, I just want you to scroll down to where you you would be entering information. Not again. Not gonna have you do that, but thoughts on the process of entering the required information here.



197
0:37:42

P7
Yeah, I think. I think it's very yeah. It's it's very straightforward. I do like how in the previous page, they did give me the just like as a as a reminder, just the information that I should be entering. Just so. It's when I make a when I make a payment, it's tethered to that, that. But yeah, I think if anything, it's it's very straightforward. And very clear.



198
0:38:11
Emily
Okay, got it? And what would be your process if you were to to be making a payment on your phone here in in terms of getting the the required numbers into this.



199
0:38:24

P7
I think I think for me my process would normally be that I already have all of my personal information just like on on the iphone, on the notes, on the notes app. So whenever I need to make a payment, I just use that and of course, if they're asking for any, maybe a reference code, or or any of that, that any additional information?



200
0:38:49
P7
Then I take a note of that. But yeah, I think everything more or less. It's it's the same.



201
0:38:55

Emily
Okay, okay, so so you would be using your your notes app instead sorry, or to to copy the information.



202
0:39:02
P7
Yeah, so like, no, anything, anything that's personal. Fine. Yeah, I would just use my notes. App. That's why I would just kind of have my own, like no personal information from my own reminder.



203
0:39:14

Emily
Okay, got it? And talk to me about the experience of of having to use multiple apps to do this, since, of course you mentioned using the notes app, and then having to open this page as well.



204
0:39:26
P7
I think, I think, where I was kind of maybe hoping for. And initially was when I was making the payment online. I was kind of hoping that all of the information it would just be



205
0:39:38

P7
already tied to my personal information. So all, all I need, I just thought, all I need to do, which is maybe enter the amount.



206
0:39:46
P7
and then maybe confirm my bank and then make a payment, and that'll be the end of that. But yeah, that's why I felt like, you know, the very seamless. But if I need to, just like, you know populate here this page again with my information and all of that. It's it's not a huge lift, I think. Maybe I think maybe for me it's just like something with the process. I'm comfortable with it.



207
0:40:16

Emily
Okay, got it? And if if and actually, let me have you, switch, back to the figma app



208
0:40:27
Emily
yep, and then go to go back, so we'll get there. Yep, so pretending that this feature is built in the app as is just like using paying just like we we talked about how how likely would you be to use to to use the app as is here.



209
0:40:49

P7
If I were to use the app as is yeah, like with the with the payment, and then having to tap on that link, and then and then going over to the other Gov page and and confirmation. Yeah, I would. Still, I would still use it, I think, for me even though that kind of want, that seamless portion, I think maybe for me mentally, because I'm seeing the official, the official Gov. Page. It gives me like



210
0:41:17
P7
it probably gives a much more sense of confidence that.



211
0:41:20

Emily
Hmm.



212
0:41:20
P7
Receiving my payment as opposed to. If I maybe make the payment here. And if, whatever reason, there's an error now, I don't know if



213
0:41:31

P7
if our payments in the limbo, or if they got it or not, so maybe just doing it on the government page, gives me a much more sense of like security and confidence.



214
0:41:41
Emily
Okay, so is, would you? Would you actually rather have that payment in the the official Gov page, as opposed to within the app.



215
0:41:50

P7
I think I think I think for me. I would still prefer to have it on the app. Personally, I would like to have an app. But-. But if it's if, if, for whatever reason, that's not possible, and I just need to



216
0:42:05
P7
use the link, I'm perfectly fine. Also doing that.



217
0:42:09

Emily
Okay, got it? And then compare for me the this version here, which we have the payment through the pay.vi.gov. Versus the version that we looked at before that did not have any payment. Options talk to me about which one you might prefer, and why.



218
0:42:30
P7
I would definitely prefer this option, the one that I'm looking at right now.



219
0:42:34

P7
I love. How excuse me! I like how you know, in the review details again. It just gives me a quick sense of just you know where my debt is. And any of my payment history in that regard. But I do like how it has a separate option. So resolve that and it helps, and it gives me a sense of just like know that? I don't know. Maybe because I like the word resolve that or that phrase. It gives maybe a sense of maybe



220
0:43:02
P7
comfort that maybe like no they're looking out for me to kind of like, you know. Help tackle this that together.



221
0:43:10

Emily
Okay, looking after you. I like that.



222
0:43:13
Emily
Got it. And then any other thoughts regarding the screen, or really any of the screens we've looked at so far, any any labels or the sections or pages are labeled anything that might be that might make things more clear for you.



223
0:43:32

P7
I think I think maybe



224
0:43:35
P7
no, I think it's i i like it. I like how like, you know, for example, here, pay a request. Help by May 1, st 2025. I like how it's in bold letters, just to remind me. I also like no, the the colors of it like make it very simple and plain. So I'm not getting, you know, bombarded with too many



225
0:43:57

P7
bells and whistles, which is a lot of yeah. So I think it's, it's very clean. And like, I said before, I do like the resolve that option. And yeah, and maybe kind of was hoping that maybe resolve that, but would also be at the bottom these other 2 deaths. But



226
0:44:15
P7
but yeah, I I really like the aesthetic. It's very concise and clear.



227
0:44:19

Emily
Okay, got it? And then if you, if you're able, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how this, what you're seeing here would compare to anything you're seeing on va.gov, on on the website in terms of any any overpayment debts, and just in terms of the experience, or things that have been like. How how clear things are.



228
0:44:43
P7
Yeah, I think maybe I think now that you know, I think about doing it on my laptop and then doing it here. I like, how like I said, like, how very clean it is. Very straight to the point.



229
0:45:01

P7
yeah, I think it's just like not having it on my phone. It's, I think, for me, it's just it's extremely aesthetically pleasing. Because I know, like on the laptop, maybe I could get distracted, or or they get too many, too much information on the page. And I think here, on on my phone, on the on this app, it it just gives me the the correct amount of information that I need. Without being



230
0:45:29
P7
overwhelmed by so many options.



231
0:45:31

Emily
Okay, too many options. Alright. You got it and let me have you tap on the the payment section again. One more small section. I want to go through before before we wrap up. In regards to the co-pays. Let me have you tap into that.



232
0:45:49
Emily
And then thoughts on, you know similar question as I had asked with the overpayments, but thoughts on the clarity in terms of bills here, how much you owe for Copays in this pretend situation.



233
0:46:04

P7
Yeah. So I think so far, it's more or less the same amount information and overview. So I do like how it informs me when my payment is due, or when I should reach out in case I need any help. I like how I think what was missing? Maybe in the previous page with the payments



234
0:46:31
P7
was this information that contact the Department of Treasury? And here's the phone number. So I do. I do appreciate that. Just like that contact information. And I think your co-, your Co pay bills for the past 6 months. That's informative, I think. I think that gives maybe a a sense of comfort



235
0:46:54

P7
for me, because at least I know that the amount the amount balance that I owe is up to date, and that's something that I've just let. There let it just rest there, for



236
0:47:06
P7
on and on.



237
0:47:08

Emily
Okay, got it. And let me have you tap into the top one. The James A. Haley Hospital hospital in Tampa, to look at the information here.



238
0:47:19
Emily
and see what information would be important to you if you if you had received, or if you were, you were looking at this particular bill.



239
0:47:29

P7
Yeah, I think, it's



240
0:47:32
P7
yeah. My information I'm giving it. It's it's standard I think maybe I think I might be inclined to be go to maybe premise statement and maybe see just like



241
0:47:45

P7
the actual maybe paperwork of it all. But yeah, it's it's the option to pay Bill right away. So I think maybe just because I do like that option.



242
0:48:06
Emily
Okay, great and since you mentioned the statements, what would you be looking for with the statements? How? How are you using them?



243
0:48:15

P7
I think for me, just like my statements might be just like if there's as a reminder, maybe. What kind of treatment one of the service that I got. So instead of seeing here that well, $50 and that's that



244
0:48:31
P7
I would like to let you know just as a reminder for myself. See? Well, why do I owe that much, and maybe just see the statement, and maybe say, Oh, it was maybe for X or Y service. And so I think for me, it's just that reminds me of like, know the context behind that payment.



245
0:48:49

Emily
Hmm, okay, good and and let me have you. Look at a statement to just see like how how you would be. I know you said you would. You would review it? To make sure to see what is on there. Is there anything else you would do with the statements from the phone.



246
0:49:05
P7
No, I think if anything



247
0:49:08

P7
no, I think I think for me it would just be just that I think. I think, because I know I would still be in kind of pay it to pay it online. But I think for me, my my peace of mind is maybe just looking at it. Then just knowing what the context of the bill is.



248
0:49:32
Emily
Okay, you're just looking at them. Got it? Okay, maybe tap done there, please.



249
0:49:38

Emily
And let's pretend that you are ready to make a payment you can walk me through. How? You would be making a payment for this particular one.



250
0:49:48
P7
Yeah, so I've got the options is pay bill. So we'll click on that and then, yeah, probably probably this is so seamless. I'll go on pay.gov, so I would like track on that, and go from there.



251
0:50:05

Emily
Okay and let me have you go go through that as well.



252
0:50:16
Emily
Okay, and just scroll down. I know there's a lot to read, so I don't. Wanna



253
0:50:19

Emily
have you and tap on. Continue to the form again, not going to have you enter in any real information.



254
0:50:26
Emily
And then scroll down a little bit. So yeah, thoughts on how you would get the the account number that you would need into into this page.



255
0:50:39

P7
Yeah, I think here. So I think here, either. I would check maybe my my notes app and see if if I have that information



256
0:50:51
P7
or if the information that I have is the one that they're asking for that regard, or otherwise, just to be on the safe side and not and avoid any discrepancies or errors. Then I would definitely just tap on whether I find my account number just to be in the safe side that I'm providing the correct information.



257
0:51:14

Emily
Okay? And when you mentioned again, you're gonna use the the notes app is, is that like, are you? How? How are you getting the information into the notes app? Is this something you're you're copying or forwarding, or how are you actually putting it in? There.



258
0:51:30
P7
Yeah, some just copy and pasting. So if there's something, if like, if there's information or anything that's given to me, that maybe it's personal, or something of account number or an Id or something. Then I just said, That's I just copy and paste that maybe it might be relevant in the future.



259
0:51:56

Emily
Okay, let me have you, Tab. I'm sorry not tab switch back to the figma app.



260
0:52:01
P7
Okay.



261
0:52:03

Emily
Yeah, and then go to go back



262
0:52:05
Emily
close. Yeah. Okay. So thoughts on on copying the account number from here into the paying website. We just had.



263
0:52:16

P7
Yeah, yeah. So I think so I think I would go. I would probably copy that account number into my



264
0:52:27
P7
into my notes app, maybe again, like, you know, it just looked at a very important number that is, gonna be tabit to me. I do see how like when it's now I look at it. It's broken into 5 parts. So maybe that might be the information that they're looking for. When it comes to making that payment but I would still, I would still tap on or click on the how to find my account number.



265
0:52:52

P7
just to be just to double or triple check on my end. Yeah, just to avoid any any errors or yeah.



266
0:53:00
Emily
Oh, from the the payment site you would tap on how to find your account number.



267
0:53:04

P7
Yeah, I would say, yeah, just so, because I know that I am entering the the correct information. And it's not just a coincidence that



268
0:53:16
Emily
Okay, and then thoughts on. If you ever might use the copy button here on this on the app for the account number.



269
0:53:27

P7
I think I think I would. I think I would. I would definitely copy but then I imagine that on the other page, because I see 5 separate lines. Then then I don't know if they want me to like.



270
0:53:43
P7
enter it into just like line 1, 5, 3, 4, line 2, 1 0 0 1. So if I copy and paste it, I'm just gonna be doing a lot of just like pasting and deleting. Yeah.



271
0:53:57

Emily
Got it. Okay, got it.



272
0:53:59
Emily
Okay? And we are just about time. So I believe those are all my questions I'm going to check in with my colleagues here. If anybody has



273
0:54:08

Emily
questions. Natasha, Michelle Ashley, if anyone would like to unmute and ask, you may do so now.



274
0:54:23
Emily
Okay, it looks like no one asked questions. Any other final thoughts you'd like to share in regards to finances and all the designs we've been looking at.



275
0:54:35

P7
No, I think this is a really really clean design. There's a lot of comfort around the design. So so, yeah, I do like like I said before, just like and the other payments page. Nothing helping me with something like that, I think. I think it's very well designed. It's very crystal clear.



276
0:54:58
Emily
Great. Thank you. Well, this has been really great. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us. It's it's really great to hear directly from veterans just you know about about your experiences here. So I appreciate, appreciate that. And that is all for us today. And I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.



277
0:55:19

P7
Absolutely okay. You're very welcome, and take good care.



278
0:55:22
Emily
Okay. Thank you. Take care.



279
0:55:23

Michelle
So much.



280
0:55:24
P7
Thank you. Goodbye.



1
0:00:00

Emily
That. So



2
0:00:02
Emily
progress. So again, can, I'd like to confirm, are you okay? If I record the audio and video video as we talk today.



3
0:00:11

P8
Yes.



4
0:00:12
Emily
Okay, great. And are you okay? If we potentially show some clips from this session to our Va partners.



5
0:00:20

P8
Yeah.



6
0:00:21
Emily
Okay, great. Okay. So now we'll get into the conversation. So I'd love to know a little bit about you as a veteran, whatever you're comfortable sharing with, of course, such things as what branch you served in when you retired or separated.



7
0:00:38

P8
Okay. My name is [redacted]. I was in the [redacted] from [redacted] of 2,001 up until 2,013 did [redacted]



8
0:00:50
P8
okay, that's it.



9
0:00:52

Emily
Okay, great



10
0:00:53
Emily
and then let to know any sort of experience you have had with veteran affairs just pretty high level to see how sort of interactions you've had with with the organization.



11
0:01:06

P8
I've used my gi bill with them, and then I've also I have my



12
0:01:14
P8
compensation. But I'm disabled. So I get my service connected disability through the Va.



13
0:01:20

P8
And then also I go to the [redacted] Va. Medical Center for all my calls, everything.



14
0:01:27
Emily
Over healthcare. Okay? Got it?



15
0:01:29

Emily
And then talk to me about how much you are using or not. The Va website and or the mobile app.



16
0:01:39
P8
Never really used the mobile app I've logged in a couple of times, but never really found use for it. I've used the website especially, for, like refill my prescriptions. Then, also, when I need to contact one of my providers, I do this. Your messaging like, I need to refill one of my prescriptions. It's easier than calling and going through



17
0:01:59

P8
the operator and waiting in call center forever. And then also, for, like filling out my gi Bill did that through. Va. Of course, the E-benefits portal that used to be. I think it's all under login.gov. Now.



18
0:02:15
Emily
-



19
0:02:15

P8
Have quite a bit of experience with it. I've probably been there about



20
0:02:19
P8
once or twice a month to refill prescriptions or schedule appointments, and do all that for my medical.



21
0:02:26

Emily
Oh, got it? Okay? And then you said you had. You had tried to use the mobile app. What what made you stop, or what like. What might you have been looking for that you weren't finding there.



22
0:02:37
P8
I just rarely use my phone for Internet and everything. So it wasn't really if I'm only using going to the website a couple of times a month. There's no real reason to download it now.



23
0:02:49

Emily
Got it.



24
0:02:50
P8
The that on my phone, for never be used really.



25
0:02:55

Emily
Okay, good. Okay. So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion. So I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have no additional information about any sort of financial, really anything in regards to the Va. So this is as anonymous as you would like it, so can I have you tell me



26
0:03:17
Emily
if you have had experience with owing the Va. Any money, and then, if if again, if you're comfortable if you, if you could tell me about any experience you might have had.



27
0:03:28

P8
Yeah, I've had several times. It's happened. There's been



28
0:03:32
P8
overpayments on like for my gi bill, because.



29
0:03:39

Emily
Okay.



30
0:03:40
P8
They send out a check early. So this overpaid. It was like [redacted] bucks that I still owed to the



31
0:03:47

P8
for that overpayment. That's really where I've gotten into trouble before is just with dropping class, and it not catching up in the system quick enough.



32
0:03:55
Emily
Oh, got it? Okay.



33
0:03:56

P8
You know we're paying for.



34
0:03:57
Emily
Sure.



35
0:03:58

Emily
And do you recall how you've been notified? Of the of these various situations.



36
0:04:06
P8
Let's see, I've always received a letter on the regular mail.



37
0:04:12

Emily
Okay, and then thoughts are sorry. Sorry. Skip ahead there. What's been your method for any sort of payment that that you've made for some of these past debts.



38
0:04:26
P8
I just let it come out of my next. Whatever's coming next month.



39
0:04:30

Emily
Okay, great. And was there anything that you feel could have been made easier from the Va. With that, either with with communication or or anything else in regards to these debts.



40
0:04:46
P8
Not really. I mean, I guess the fact that I was only notified via mail. So.



41
0:04:53

P8
I guess that's 1 thing. Maybe if they send me an email, it'd be a little bit better



42
0:04:59
P8
snail mail works. I mean, I was notified about that.



43
0:05:02

P8
At least I didn't just all of a sudden see a surprise coming in my next call and



44
0:05:07
P8
just disappearing, or something like that. So.



45
0:05:10

Emily
That's a good.



46
0:05:12
P8
Okay, go ahead.



47
0:05:12

P8
Maybe send me an email. I don't know what else I could really do.



48
0:05:17
Emily
Okay, you would. You would prefer an email, or you would also want an email.



49
0:05:24

Emily
And then any I know you mentioned that. You? You have at least some health care. Do you have experience with medical co-payments through Va.



50
0:05:35
P8
No, I've always been service connected, so I've never had to do.



51
0:05:40

Emily
Okay, great



52
0:05:43
Emily
so let me have. I'm gonna we're gonna move into the prototype section. Here, let me have you share your screen and let me know if you need any help walking you through that process.



53
0:05:55

P8
Do I do that?



54
0:05:59
P8
So it should just.



55
0:06:00

Emily
Yep, yeah. You should be able to tap once, and at the bottom there should be a share button. It's usually labeled with the word share, I believe.



56
0:06:34
Emily
all right, and we're working. I love it all right. So now we're gonna leave this as is. Now let me have you open up the figma app that you've had downloaded



57
0:06:50

Emily
all right and tap the log into figma. I'm going to give you some test credentials here.



58
0:07:00
Emily
Okay, so the email is VA test



59
0:07:10

Emily
0 0 0



60
0:07:16
Emily
at gmail.com.



61
0:07:27

Emily
okay? And the password, it's going to be the letters. No, we're not going to create anything, and then the password is going to be the letters Va. Repeated 4 times. So VAVA. VAVA. All lowercase.



62
0:07:43
Emily
Alright. Go ahead and log in. And then that's gonna prompt. A.



63
0:07:47

Emily
yeah. Give me, okay, I'm going to give you the authentication code, which is 5, 9, 9,



64
0:07:57
Emily
8, 6, 6, 8.



65
0:08:03

Emily
Alright. Go ahead and log in and continue with mobile app.



66
0:08:12
Emily
What's that is



67
0:08:13

Emily
up alright? Just you can tap out of that. Okay? So now I'm gonna send you a link. I'm gonna send it within the zoom chat. And okay, if you open up zoom again, you should have a chat or sorry a link there.



68
0:08:30
Emily
Yep, go and tap on that, please.



69
0:08:40

Emily
Alright. This is loading. Give it just a moment to come through.



70
0:08:47
Emily
All right. So here we have your fake app, home screen?



71
0:08:53

Emily
So if you if you could, yeah, there we go. I was. Gonna say, clear that message perfect. So first, st I'm not going to have you tap on anything quite yet, but pretending you are opening the mobile app here. Where would you expect to find any information from money that you owe, for example, from an overpayment.



72
0:09:16
P8
Maybe in Claims



73
0:09:18

Emily
On the claim. Okay? Good. Any claims, any any other questions?



74
0:09:22
Emily
I'm, sorry.



75
0:09:23

P8
In the bottom, under, maybe in the bottom, under benefits or payments.



76
0:09:28
Emily
Okay, okay. Got it?



77
0:09:31

Emily
Any other? Oh, yeah, any any other thoughts you have where you might find it.



78
0:09:38
P8
Maybe it's maybe in the latest payment, but.



79
0:09:45

Emily
In what time.



80
0:09:49
P8
I was thinking, maybe under the see details.



81
0:09:52

Emily
Okay, got it?



82
0:09:52
P8
That's David.



83
0:09:56

Emily
Okay. So since you mentioned both the benefits and payment sections on the bottom, we will find it under payments. And I'm wondering any thoughts you might have for making that even more clear. That that's where you might find that information.



84
0:10:17
P8
No with it, just saying payments alone. It's



85
0:10:21

P8
kind of making me think about what they paid me, and it's only showing like what's been sent to me, but



86
0:10:28
P8
I don't know. It makes sense. I don't. I don't have any suggestions as to making it really much clearer.



87
0:10:35

P8
It's 1 of those things where you just gotta explore around and find your way.



88
0:10:39
Emily
Sure. Sure. Yeah. Okay, so let me have you tap into that payment section



89
0:10:46

Emily
and then over before you can scroll around. But don't yet tap on anything, thoughts on how this is structured, especially knowing the title of payments, and what might make more sense if anything.



90
0:11:02
P8
So this is actually pretty clear, and you got your payments. And then history 1,000 information.



91
0:11:10

P8
This is pretty clear and simple. I like this.



92
0:11:14
Emily
Got it



93
0:11:15

Emily
and talk to me about the. So in this case we're going to pretend that you do have copays in this in this pretend world. But talk to me about the the brief information that is below both the words overpayment debts and copays. What sort of high level information might you want from this page.



94
0:11:37
P8
I think just telling you like, how much is gonna be due, how much you owe.



95
0:11:42

P8
And maybe there's like a deadline on when we need to pay it.



96
0:11:49
Emily
Okay. Deadline. Go.



97
0:11:49

P8
Really does deadlines. I'm not sure about that. So.



98
0:11:53
Emily
Okay.



99
0:11:55

Emily
Alright oh, sorry. Go ahead.



100
0:11:58
P8
Good.



101
0:11:59

P8
This seems pretty good and clear.



102
0:12:01
Emily
Okay, got it. Alright, as as I said, the only other thing you might want to know is, is any deadline right here?



103
0:12:10

Emily
Okay, let me have you so I'm gonna have you tap into the the overpayments to get your thoughts on how clear it is on overall, what you currently owe in this pretend situation.



104
0:12:26
Emily
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. It hit it payments again. I think that was is the



105
0:12:31

Emily
copays. I'm going to get you to the overpayments.



106
0:12:34
P8
Yeah. There, the over tenants.



107
0:12:37

Emily
Yep.



108
0:12:39
P8
Okay.



109
0:12:41

Emily
Yeah, there you go. Perfect. Yeah. So, looking at the information here, how how clear is it for how much you are currently owing in this pretend situation?



110
0:12:56
P8
Yeah, real clear, because it directly says your current balance. So



111
0:13:05

P8
yeah, that's really clear.



112
0:13:06
Emily
Okay. Any other information you would want to have on this page for seeing the overall, what the different debts are.



113
0:13:17

P8
No, I don't know how you make.



114
0:13:19
P8
There'd be more information.



115
0:13:23

Emily
Alright got it so we're just gonna look at the the top one, the post 9 11 Gi. Bill for housing and if you want to tap into that let me know what information would be important to you in regards to for this particular debt, just just for this topic. Yeah, there we go.



116
0:13:44
P8
Okay, here you do have a few days. That's



117
0:13:48

P8
yeah. Your balance in your due date is the most important for you in your transaction history.



118
0:13:57
P8
Oh, and it gives you like. I didn't know you get like keys in the game.



119
0:14:01

P8
It's good information.



120
0:14:10
P8
Oh, okay, yeah, that give you your letter. History.



121
0:14:13

Emily
It's pretty.



122
0:14:15
P8
Pretty, thorough.



123
0:14:18

Emily
Okay? Since you mentioned the the letter history. What? How? How useful is that to you? What what would you be using that for?



124
0:14:29
P8
I'll just remember it just reminded me of how they always notify me through letters, but.



125
0:14:33

Emily
Hmm.



126
0:14:34
P8
I know there's like a timeframe of when somebody get the letter that you have like 90 days, I think it is before where you can appeal it. So, just remembering that you have that timeframe is, or if you were to know that that deadline is there.



127
0:14:51

Emily
Okay.



128
0:14:52
P8
You know which date to go by for that.



129
0:14:56

Emily
Okay, would there be? So as I said, like knowing the date is important. Anything else in regards to the debt letter that you might want to know here.



130
0:15:04
P8
Now the most important thing is the date.



131
0:15:06

Emily
Okay, just the dates. Got it. And then



132
0:15:12
Emily
what? Yeah. And any other information that might be useful for you here for this particular debt.



133
0:15:20

P8
See



134
0:15:24
P8
maybe from when it was you actually like it, says the post. 9 11 Gi. Depth for housing, but it doesn't say for like which month that housing was either an overpayment



135
0:15:37

P8
or like for why it occurred, I mean



136
0:15:40
P8
oh, there's actually right there, I see. Why might I have some more information.



137
0:15:47

Emily
Okay, do you want? You want to tap on that and just see if if that would would be sufficient.



138
0:15:53
P8
Any common reasons to actually have the reason would be helpful to know



139
0:15:58

P8
well, why are you being charged this money for that month? But.



140
0:16:03
Emily
Hmm, okay.



141
0:16:06

Emily
So so you, you would want additional information. It sounds like.



142
0:16:16
Emily
would there? Would. Would there be more information? You would want.



143
0:16:20

P8
Yeah, which like for basically, which month I got, I'm being charged for.



144
0:16:27
Emily
Got it. Okay.



145
0:16:28

P8
That payment? Or if it's like, even when you go to like Co payments, what off? What appointment am I being charged that copayment for stuff like that that is usually found in the



146
0:16:39
P8
the letters that they send out to.



147
0:16:46

Emily
Okay, got it? And then so additional information it sounds like. And then what else would you expect or want to be able to do from here in regard to this particular debt.



148
0:17:02
P8
Nothing under here, I think, besides that, it's pretty good.



149
0:17:05

Emily
Okay, got it? And pretending that this is built in real life. And again, we'll kind of suspend relief because I believe belief, because I know you said you don't. You aren't currently using the app. But thoughts on, how likely you would use this



150
0:17:25
Emily
if it were were actually.



151
0:17:26

P8
No problem.



152
0:17:27
P8
Still, probably do it online, just through my computer, because I'm so used to doing it that way. There's



153
0:17:33

P8
no real need to change over, to now.



154
0:17:38
P8
But if I didn't have a computer, of course this would make a lot easier.



155
0:17:43

Emily
Sure. Yeah, sure got it. Okay? And



156
0:17:48
Emily
so I know you said that for the debts you've had, it's it's been. It's been taken out of your your benefits. How about if if let's say you had a debt where you you were actually making financial payments to the Va.



157
0:18:06

P8
I would like to know? Basically, like.



158
0:18:09
P8
when my payments do, what are the charges? I'm late on that payment. What happens if we miss a payment? Is there



159
0:18:17

P8
the Grace period, or anything like that?



160
0:18:20
P8
And then maybe, like, if I'm



161
0:18:23

P8
if I can set up in the automated automatic



162
0:18:27
P8
charge to my card to make those payments stuff like that.



163
0:18:31

P8
Okay? Got it helpful.



164
0:18:35
Emily
And then if you so since you talked, you talked about the being able to set up payments from your card, etc, knowing that you're that you're not seeing that here thoughts on again. How how likely it would be that that you would that you would use it.



165
0:18:55

P8
If it was, depends on if it was something that I can only do on the app, or if it's also available.



166
0:19:03
P8
like, if it's available online. I'm gonna do it, too.



167
0:19:08

Emily
Okay, so just depending, if you can do it on on your computer as well.



168
0:19:13
Emily
Okay. Alright, let me have you tap the the payments button on the lower right again. I'm gonna get you to a different section.



169
0:19:22

Emily
Alright scroll all the way down, and the the blank gray area toward the bottom. Tap that area once



170
0:19:32
Emily
all right perfect, and then go back into overpayment debts.



171
0:19:39

Emily
Okay? So again, we're going to look at this, this top debt from housing. We're going to pretend that



172
0:19:49
Emily
you believe that this debt is in error. You don't actually, either you don't think it should be this amount, or you don't think it should be there at all. What would be your next steps.



173
0:20:04

P8
I'd be probably going under review details.



174
0:20:08
Emily
Okay.



175
0:20:10

P8
Do you want me to click it?



176
0:20:11
Emily
Yeah, yeah, yeah, if you can go and tap in just to see what? Yeah, find the information here. And



177
0:20:16

Emily
if this will be sufficient.



178
0:20:26
P8
That's again. It doesn't give you the information. Why.



179
0:20:31

P8
oh, from like what month it was from so.



180
0:20:34
Emily
Okay. Yep.



181
0:20:35

P8
That'd be nice to have to clarify, while why I have to pay.



182
0:20:41
Emily
Sure.



183
0:20:46

Emily
And then thought, thoughts on what you do. If you believed that this was somehow in error, what what? Your next step would be.



184
0:20:55
P8
Ouch!



185
0:20:56

P8
Maybe you resolve that, but it's kind of request



186
0:21:01
P8
Oh, it's really not that clear on what you can do when you're here.



187
0:21:06

Emily
Okay, what do you think would make it more clear?



188
0:21:12
P8
Under the Request Help I see "dispute this debt." Having this on the main portion.



189
0:21:18

P8
The main portion after you click on it.



190
0:21:22
Emily
Oh, you mean like where it says, result.



191
0:21:26

P8
Yeah, under having underneath that, having an option for dispute, that'd be.



192
0:21:30
Emily
Got it. Okay to have it separate. Okay, alright. And then



193
0:21:37

Emily
and and same same question like, if let's say you, you were actually making payments, but didn't believed you didn't have the money



194
0:21:46
Emily
thoughts on on your next steps for that in in terms of



195
0:21:51

Emily
seeing if there could be other other arrangements for payment.



196
0:21:57
P8
Probably would be under resolve other ways to pay.



197
0:22:01

Emily
Okay.



198
0:22:05
P8
Oh, just pay by phone, pay by name, didn't really answer that. So



199
0:22:12

P8
know really what you can do besides calling and contacting them.



200
0:22:19
P8
So maybe if you have, like, an actual options



201
0:22:25

P8
under the resolved debt of John, help pain or request help



202
0:22:31
P8
in paying that, or something like that, I don't know if you don't have the money. What are you supposed to do.



203
0:22:37

Emily
Got it. Okay, yeah. Let me have you actually tap back into that resolved debt section that you were just there? Yeah. And then tap on the request help?



204
0:22:52
Emily
See? You?



205
0:22:54

Emily
Yeah. And and okay, yeah.



206
0:22:55
Emily
any thoughts on on how to make that clear? Since it seems like it was, it was not clear that that's where you might go to get this information.



207
0:23:07

P8
Springing the debt row



208
0:23:11
P8
into here, and it says, request that kind of gives you makes you think that it's like



209
0:23:17

P8
asking for help in using the app itself, requesting help with the payment.



210
0:23:26
Emily
Got it? Okay? Alright. So.



211
0:23:28

P8
Moving it to the front wouldn't help.



212
0:23:33
Emily
Alright, and then once, if you can tap the the request, help once more thoughts on the different sections that that, it's offering, under request, help in in terms of clarity.



213
0:23:52

P8
Dispute is the what we were talking about earlier.



214
0:23:57
P8
Oh, this is clear and simple. I like this.



215
0:24:03

Emily
Okay, got it



216
0:24:04
Emily
and let me have you scroll down. Just tap on. I think it was the second one under the start. Your debt dispute.



217
0:24:14

Emily
Just have a curious to get your thoughts on that.



218
0:24:20
Emily
I'm sorry. Start your request for debt help. Sorry I misspoke.



219
0:24:25

Emily
Yeah. And just I'm not gonna have you read everything, and of course, but have a look through here and give over overall thoughts on the information provided here.



220
0:24:38
P8
That tap. 2 things.



221
0:24:44

P8
What else?



222
0:24:49
P8
We're kind of a starting.



223
0:24:54

Emily
Yeah. Yeah.



224
0:24:56
Emily
Yeah. The the start. Your request for dead help.



225
0:25:08

Emily
Yeah. Tha thoughts on the information.



226
0:25:11
Emily
Please go ahead.



227
0:25:14

P8
Just brings you to the form that you need to fill out.



228
0:25:18
P8
Events.



229
0:25:20

P8
you know, even Pre fills information for you. So that's actually pretty nice and simple, and start your dispute.



230
0:25:27
P8
It's hopeful.



231
0:25:29

Emily
Alright great! Let me have you tap on. Done there, please.



232
0:25:36
Emily
Okay, and then, we're gonna pretend that you are ready to make a payment. Walk me through. How you would do that here.



233
0:25:54

P8
Resolve that.



234
0:25:56
Emily
Okay.



235
0:25:57

P8
Pay online.



236
0:26:06
P8
It looks like this just brings you to Va website, though. So you can't really pay it inside the app. I'm guessing.



237
0:26:14

Emily
Hmm, okay. Yeah. Thoughts. Yeah. Let me let me have you. Again. I will not. I promise I will not have you enter any actual payment information? But go ahead and and tap on the that. That pay button.



238
0:26:37
P8
Okay. So this is basically just bringing back into the Internet site. So



239
0:26:42

P8
it'd be nice to be able to do it through the app itself. Because I guess now, I'm gonna have to log into my



240
0:26:50
P8
log, actually, log into my login.gov account kind of mix to



241
0:26:57

P8
makes it pointless to even use the app. If you have to go online. In the 1st place.



242
0:27:03
Emily
Let me have you tap the the button that says pay online. There's 1 there's there's 1 at the top there, on the upper left.



243
0:27:13

Emily
just to get to the next page.



244
0:27:17
Emily
and then scroll down a little bit again. I know there's a lot to read, so I won't have you read everything, and I'm not going to have you actually enter any information in but scroll down a little bit more.



245
0:27:29

Emily
Yeah. So the so the section where you would have to enter the information here, thoughts on the process here



246
0:27:39
Emily
in terms of if you are actually making a payment.



247
0:27:45

P8
So.



248
0:27:47
P8
It's all of the information that



249
0:27:49

P8
I've never done it before. I didn't know you needed like that



250
0:27:52
P8
payee number and all that. I guess that's on the letter that they send you



251
0:27:57

P8
kind of makes it seem a little bit more complicated than it needs to be.



252
0:28:01
Emily
Oh, got it



253
0:28:02

P8
Just be able to put in your card number on the app and make a payment.



254
0:28:08
Emily
Okay.



255
0:28:09

P8
It's the government. So I guess everything gets complicated.



256
0:28:15
Emily
Got it. Thoughts on. Let's say, if you were to doing this in real life, what would you be doing to find all of the required information that they have here.



257
0:28:28

P8
It's on my letter. That's another good point about what I said in beginning on having an email sent to you.



258
0:28:35
P8
Because what if I had accidentally threw out my letter. I can get that payee number is what they're asking for.



259
0:28:45

P8
The deduction code. I don't even know all that means, but



260
0:28:50
P8
so if I don't have my letter and kind of out of luck.



261
0:28:53

Emily
I see. Okay, yeah. Let me have you switch back to the figma app right now.



262
0:29:07
Emily
See? I mean, oh, okay, let's see if it brings it back to where we were.



263
0:29:13

P8
Probably shouldn't just hit that.



264
0:29:16
Emily
I give it just a moment to load.



265
0:29:20

P8
Okay.



266
0:29:22
Emily
Okay, and then tap on payments to walk you through getting to specifically where we were. Yeah. So go ahead and tap on the payments, button on the lower right.



267
0:29:33

Emily
Yep, and then scroll down and again tap once into that blank gray area at the toward the bottom.



268
0:29:41
Emily
Okay, and then tap on overpayment debts.



269
0:29:45

Emily
It's just getting us back to where you were.



270
0:29:48
Emily
Yep and yeah, again to review details. We're gonna look at that top one again



271
0:29:58

Emily
and resolve debt and go to pay online. This is just getting us back to where you would have been because the prototype kicked us out. Unfortunately, so, thoughts on this information being shared



272
0:30:15
Emily
on the app.



273
0:30:18

P8
Information is.



274
0:30:20
P8
Oh, okay, this is actually helpful. Because on the pay online thing was asking for like that payee number. And then the deduction code



275
0:30:30

P8
that they required a letter having that here makes it



276
0:30:34
P8
see? I don't need to go hunting for my letter to fill it out. So that's nice to have on here.



277
0:30:40

Emily
Okay, great thoughts on how? This could be even more clear in in terms of notifying you that the information is here to pay online.



278
0:30:55
P8
Yeah, I don't know how you make it more clear than listing it out like they do.



279
0:31:01

Emily
okay? And what might if if you were making a payment on the phone what might be your process to getting the information that you that you need into the the government website to pay.



280
0:31:17
P8
Either finding the letter, or if I'm doing on the phone, I can go into this app. And right here, give me all the information I need. It looks like.



281
0:31:27

Emily
Okay? And then thoughts on switching between the apps between. In this case, our fake va app, and then the



282
0:31:37
Emily
payment site.



283
0:31:40

P8
Nice to have it all rather than having to switch between things like that.



284
0:31:48
Emily
If if if it's app, oh, sorry! Go ahead.



285
0:31:51

P8
But I mean, it's



286
0:31:53
P8
it's simple. It's gives you the direct link to click on so can't really make it simpler.



287
0:32:00

P8
more clear than that, I guess. Besides having your own one.



288
0:32:05
Emily
Okay, got it? And if if things were built in real life with like this, this payment process here



289
0:32:15

Emily
again, knowing I know you know you don't actually use the app at least right now. Thoughts on how likely it would be that you might use it for this.



290
0:32:25
P8
And might use it for this. When I, after finding out that you need this information for the payment.



291
0:32:32

P8
I'm not prepared to have to dig around to find the letter I might have throughout the weather efficiently. So



292
0:32:38
P8
having the information right here mixed with that, okay, got it.



293
0:32:44

Emily
Okay? And then, compare for me the likelihood of you of using the app in this scenario, where it does have the payment option versus the other scenario, where there was no payment. Option.



294
0:33:01
P8
This I more likely use it where you can pay.



295
0:33:04

Emily
Rather than not having that option.



296
0:33:07
P8
Having it as well.



297
0:33:10

Emily
Alright got it, and thoughts are how? How would you?



298
0:33:15
Emily
Because it is 2 different applications. How do you believe you would? You would get the information, let's say, like the file number, for example, from the app over to the payment site.



299
0:33:30

P8
Well, I think it opens that up in new window, or right now it doesn't because we got kicked out.



300
0:33:39
P8
So.



301
0:33:39

P8
No, I would need mine. I wouldn't



302
0:33:43
P8
maybe having it to where it pops up in a separate window rather than it. Taking away this screen that I'm looking at right now and then, after I click on the



303
0:33:55

P8
the va.gov site like being able. Seems like you can't switch back after you click.



304
0:34:02
Emily
Hmm.



305
0:34:04

P8
Or she.



306
0:34:06
Emily
Okay. Yeah, I mean, pretend. But there, there, there would be 2 different applications. I mean, I'm just wondering what what you believe your process would be in order to, let's say, put them the file number



307
0:34:18

Emily
over into the the payment site.



308
0:34:23
P8
Does this allow copy?



309
0:34:25

P8
This won't allow you to copy, it doesn't look like, so I guess I'd have to write it down.



310
0:34:30
Emily
Got it. Okay.



311
0:34:31

P8
Just switch back and forth.



312
0:34:34
P8
That I'd probably write it down.



313
0:34:36

Emily
Oh, oh, oh, you would. You would write it down first.st



314
0:34:40
Emily
Got it? Okay?



315
0:34:42

Emily
And yeah. Any any other thoughts on on that experience. Of like you said you having to write it down and then switching applications to make payments.



316
0:34:58
P8
Maybe if there's under where it says, Pay this debt online, maybe there's a little



317
0:35:05

P8
description saying you're gonna need this information for your payment



318
0:35:11
P8
like just telling you that you should write it down if you don't have the letter with the file number, and just something to remind you that you're gonna need it.



319
0:35:19

Emily
Okay. On this page or on on a previous screen?



320
0:34:56
P8
On this page.



321
0:35:25

Emily
Got it. Okay, what what do you think would be would be useful to have.



322
0:35:29
P8
Let me just saying, like



323
0:35:32

P8
when you make your payment, you're going to need your file number and payee number.



324
0:35:39
P8
Little reminder on this screen that you're gonna need this information before you leave the screen.



325
0:35:45

Emily
Okay, before, yeah. Wh. What do you think would make that more clear than than what is written here?



326
0:35:51
P8
Oh, well, there's nothing here that tells you that you're gonna need this.



327
0:35:56

P8
You all right, you'll need to provide the following details. Okay, I maybe just saying



328
0:36:06
P8
I guess they do explain it.



329
0:36:09

P8
But kind of it doesn't tell you that once you click on the pay on pay.va.gov



330
0:36:15
P8
thing that's gonna take this information away from you.



331
0:36:19

Emily
Hmm, okay.



332
0:36:20
P8
Maybe being able to copy it.



333
0:36:22

P8
It doesn't let you trying to do like a copy and paste with my.



334
0:36:28
Emily
Okay, but it won't let me



335
0:36:31

Emily
got it. Okay, and then any other thoughts, I actually wanna hit the the back link at the top left there



336
0:36:43
Emily
any any other thoughts regarding this.



337
0:36:47

Emily
the screens here, the payment score, the payment information screens? That might make things more useful.



338
0:36:55
P8
That's nice and clear and concise.



339
0:36:58

Emily
Okay, great, and let me have you tap on the payment section again on the lower right.



340
0:37:06
Emily
I'm gonna go through there we go. So I know you said in in real life you don't pay. You don't pay any copays in this, but in this pretends situation you will. So I have a couple of questions here, let me have you tap into copays toward the bottom there first, st



341
0:37:26

Emily
and then thoughts here overall on what information would be important to you in regards to any sort of Copay bills.



342
0:37:40
P8
This is pretty clear, and it tells you which clinic it's from, or give you review details, so



343
0:37:50

P8
I don't know how you can make it any better than it is here.



344
0:37:54
Emily
Okay, got it? And let's look at this this, that top one, the James A. Haley hospital.



345
0:38:01

Emily
In terms of any any information you would need in regards to this particular Copay Bill.



346
0:38:10
P8
Okay.



347
0:38:16

P8
due date.



348
0:38:23
P8
Zoom, it looks like I've never done it before, so I'm not sure what else you would.



349
0:38:30

Emily
Okay, got it all right.



350
0:38:33
Emily
And are there? Are there any instances where you receive statements? And that doesn't have to be with with Va. Just with any sort of other other account. You might have that where you receive statements, statements.



351
0:38:48

P8
Oh, yeah, I get all my like, my bank statements, my credit, card statements, everything comes online.



352
0:38:54
Emily
Okay, got it? And what like overall? Are you using those? How are you using those? If so.



353
0:39:02

P8
They just stay in my inbox, something that I need to dispute on. I don't even look at them.



354
0:39:11
Emily
Okay, you're you're only looking. If you if you need to check something.



355
0:39:15

P8
Yeah.



356
0:39:16
Emily
Got it. Okay?



357
0:39:18

Emily
So pretending again, jumping, pretending that you do have copays thoughts on potentially using the statements here.



358
0:39:29
P8
I mean, if I had Copays, if I ever needed



359
0:39:33

P8
needed to dispute something that they're trying to charge me for, or anything like that I need to like having the statements here would be very helpful.



360
0:39:43
Emily
Hmm. Okay.



361
0:39:46

Emily
Do you know what you might do with the statement? Exactly. I know you said you. You'd want you'd want to have them if you have to dispute anything. Yeah, what what might you do with them?



362
0:39:54
P8
Just in case, just in case like having



363
0:39:58

P8
having them there. I mean, you don't know if you need to dispute them until you actually see the statement. So.



364
0:40:04
Emily
Okay, and let me have you open up the statement to see what this looks like. Here.



365
0:40:12

P8
The Pdf, so the current statement.



366
0:40:16
Emily
Yep.



367
0:40:23

Emily
yeah. Thoughts on how how useful it would be to have this in the app here.



368
0:40:31
P8
Mean the same thing just



369
0:40:34

P8
nice to actually, it's basically looks like just a scan version of your paper when they send you.



370
0:40:40
Emily
Okay.



371
0:40:41

P8
So it's nicer than having the paper one.



372
0:40:44
Emily
Okay. Yeah.



373
0:40:45

P8
Easier to keep track of.



374
0:40:46
Emily
You're not gonna throw it out. So on accident.



375
0:40:51

Emily
Okay? Well, there, since you said it's easier to keep track of anything anything you'd want to do in regards to keeping track of the statements.



376
0:41:00
P8
Like, I said, in case you have to dispute something, or if there was an overcharge or anything like that.



377
0:41:09

Emily
Okay, let me have you click done there?



378
0:41:14
Emily
So as a sense you brought up. If there's something that you wanted to, that you needed to dispute what would be your process for dispute, for, for starting to dispute.



379
0:41:29

P8
I can't see anything here.



380
0:41:31
P8
Maybe on your paid bill.



381
0:41:33

P8
Okay.



382
0:41:37
P8
we'll just



383
0:41:42

P8
oh, request help!



384
0:41:52
P8
It looks like it's giving me an option.



385
0:41:57

Emily
What what sort of information would you be looking for?



386
0:42:04
P8
like how it kind of was under the overpayments where you can actually go into a section like there was a dispute option under the blue pay bill



387
0:42:15

P8
right here, but it's not giving any options at all for that. So they have something something there.



388
0:42:26
Emily
Okay, let me have you. Yeah, let me close that



389
0:42:31

Emily
and then tap on the the help section on the upper right.



390
0:42:39
Emily
Yeah. Thoughts on the information presented here, and how useful that might be.



391
0:42:45

P8
This helps with that most of the time when you see a hope option in the upper right, you're thinking, like me. Personally, I think that that's more



392
0:42:55
P8
help using the app. Not actually help with your copays.



393
0:42:59

Emily
Okay, got it?



394
0:43:00
P8
So that's where that can get a little bit confusing.



395
0:43:05

P8
Let me talk to her.



396
0:43:07
P8
Do you have like a you see how it says Copay. Help at the top. Do you have that as an actual option to click on rather than just under help.



397
0:43:16

Emily
Okay, so that's under the main screen.



398
0:43:19
Emily
Okay? So so labeled as Copay help instead of just help.



399
0:43:23

P8
Exactly.



400
0:43:24
Emily
Got it. Okay, that makes sense.



401
0:43:26

Emily
And then, we're gonna pretend that you are ready to make a payment here for this one walk me through your process to make a payment, and again, it won't have you enter in any actual information.



402
0:43:41
P8
Pay bill, and then we probably do the thing on, save out there the same way that



403
0:43:49

P8
as we did for the overpayment.



404
0:43:52
Emily
Okay, let me let me have you go ahead and and tap on that.



405
0:44:00

Emily
and scroll down and tap on. Continue to the form in the middle of the page.



406
0:44:08
Emily
Yep, yeah, I can do. There we go



407
0:44:11

Emily
and then scroll down a little bit. Just gonna have you skip most of this? Oh, yeah. So right here. So just a little bit above.



408
0:44:21
Emily
Yeah, right there. So yeah. Thoughts on finding finding the information here, the the account number and how you might go about that.



409
0:44:32

P8
I would probably click on. Where do I find my Va. Account? Number.



410
0:44:37
Emily
Okay, got it. Let me have you switch back to the figma app.



411
0:44:44

P8
How can I switch? If I hit the X will.



412
0:44:47
Emily
Oh, sorry I switch switch applications within the phone. Go back to Figma instead of the browser that you're in right now. Yep, yep, exactly.



413
0:44:56

Emily
Yep, right here



414
0:44:58
Emily
and let's see, yeah. Tap it like likes to just kick us out of things which is annoying.



415
0:45:06

Emily
Alright, let that go.



416
0:45:09
Emily
Let that load up a bit.



417
0:45:13

Emily
Okay scroll and tap payments on the lower right. I'm gonna get you back to exactly where we were.



418
0:45:20
Emily
Tap on. Sorry I'm sorry. Go back one screen, go to the back to the payments, page.



419
0:45:26

Emily
yep, and then scroll down and tap into the blank gray area at the very yep perfect tap on co-pays.



420
0:45:35
Emily
and again go into the review details here.



421
0:45:43

Emily
Alright. And then so yeah, so thought again. So this would be where you would actually get get back. But thoughts on finding the information you would need here for.



422
0:45:54
P8
The copy option here if they didn't have that for the overpayment. But having that here is very helpful where you can click on it and copies your account. Number.



423
0:46:06

Emily
Okay? Great.



424
0:46:10
Emily
Okay?



425
0:46:11

Emily
And let me see.



426
0:46:16
Emily
Hi, other other thoughts to share regarding anything you're seeing here with the co-pays. Any information that might also be useful.



427
0:46:32

P8
Yeah, no units.



428
0:46:35
P8
Nice and simple. I like it.



429
0:46:37

Emily
Alright simple is good.



430
0:46:39
Emily
And then any thoughts specifically how things are labeled. If there's anything else that would make things more clear. I know you, said the help button. It would be more helpful if it said Copay. Help. But yeah, any other sections that might be



431
0:46:54

Emily
rename that make things more clear.



432
0:46:59
P8
I've never really done Copays before, so I don't know how much more you would need. Besides, this



433
0:47:04

P8
so looks looks good.



434
0:47:07
Emily
Alright got it all right, and I believe those are all my questions. I'm gonna check in with my colleagues. If anyone has any additional questions that I have not covered here. I don't see anything in the chat, but if anyone wants to unmute and ask, you may do so now.



435
0:47:34

Emily
all right, I'll take that as a no, but that is all we have. I really appreciate your time, Brandon. It's always so important to have to talk with veterans about going through these experiences to see what is important, and see how we can potentially make things better for everybody. So thank you for taking the time with us.



436
0:47:57
P8
Yeah, of course.



437
0:47:58

Emily
Yeah, and I know will be reaching out to you shortly. I don't know. At some point, at some point they'll be reaching out to you regarding this. And yeah, that is it for us today. And I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day.



438
0:48:15
P8
Thank you. Have a good one.



439
0:48:16

Emily
Thanks! Take care!



1
0:00:02
Emily
Ask you yet again. So now that we are recording, are you okay? If I record video and audio today.



2
0:00:09

P9
That's fine!



3
0:00:10
Emily
Alright great. And are you okay? If we potentially use a clip the clips of this to show our Va partners.



4
0:00:18

P9
That's fine!



5
0:00:19
Emily
Alright great. Okay. So just general questions. Love to know a bit about yourself, and whatever you are, comfortable, sharing as a veteran what branch you served in, if you, when you retired or separated.



6
0:00:35

P9
Yeah, I actually I served in the [redacted] from 2,006, 2,010. And then after that, I decided to separate and go to college instead. And then, after I worked for the [redacted] as I started there. Well, I've had different positions prior to that, like from a



7
0:00:58
P9
out like private sector. But pretty much like in the software, tech tech side of things. Just put it that way.



8
0:01:06

Emily
Okay. Good.



9
0:01:06
P9
So it's working like a [redacted]



10
0:01:12

P9
But yeah.



11
0:01:13
Emily
Okay, great. And then what sort of experience have you had? With Va.



12
0:01:21

P9
So I had, like I had



13
0:01:23
P9
couple of surgeries from the Va. And yeah, I've I've used



14
0:01:30

P9
Yep, prescription medications. Psychiatrists, I believe.



15
0:01:38
P9
They? Oh, no, for Va they they sourced it out. It's not a it's not a Va's



16
0:01:45

P9
psychiatrists. It's a they



17
0:01:47
P9
sourced it out so like outside, I think, is what they did. And then they just they just paid for it. And then, yeah, so like, I, I use va like here and there when I can.



18
0:01:57

P9
1st like, for things that are not like very, very urgent that I need like tomorrow, you know, like urgent care if I would just go to like my my doctor for those kind of things, but otherwise, like I try to use it, since it's free.



19
0:02:12
Emily
Okay, yeah. Got it? And then, what sort of experience have you had with the Va website? And or the mobile app.



20
0:02:21

P9
I used to use just the website, because I didn't like clogging my phone with like apps and stuff like that. So that's why, like, I didn't have fig figma on my phone. That's why I was using my ipad earlier, because where I had my



21
0:02:34
P9
figma, but but lately, probably in the past year or so, because I've done a number of



22
0:02:42

P9
meetings with with prison technologies. And then I use the Va app to you know, to do some testing, so I figured like I might as well just keep it there. So whenever I and then since then I use it for let's say I wanna request for refill for



23
0:03:00
P9
medication or I believe I did set up an appointment through there one time. But I'm just so used to like doing it in the website that sometimes I'm most of the time on my computer, anyway. So I just, I would just go to like Va



24
0:03:14

P9
back over. I forgot the website exactly. It's in my bookmark. I just do it through there. But otherwise, I just kept the app in my on my phone for like quick things. So if I'm not around my my computer, I just use the app.



25
0:03:27
Emily
Okay. Alright. So if you're if you're not close to your computer and any other reasons you might choose to use the app over your computer.



26
0:03:36

P9
just for mobility, I guess. Yeah, if I'm just not around there, because, like, if I'm on my workstation, I'm also I'm over there like, you know, I don't usually like when I work. I don't.



27
0:03:47
P9
I have my phone like



28
0:03:49

P9
away so that I don't get distracted. So that's why like I use my my, yeah, my workstation like you know, for everything else.



29
0:03:59
Emily
Got it. Okay, great, all right. So we're going to move into the financial portion of the discussion. So I want to make sure that you're only sharing what you're willing. I have no additional info, or I have no information whatsoever about any sort of finances for you. So any, let's know any experience. Have you had experience with owing the Va. Money such as for benefit overpayments.



30
0:04:25

P9
There is



31
0:04:27
P9
a co-pay couple of years ago, and there's 1, i believe, last year. Think last year, not too long ago, say that



32
0:04:35

P9
there was a copay, but I end it ended up getting I believe they're getting



33
0:04:41
P9
nulled, or yeah, I ended up not paying for it. I talked to him about it. I forgot where it was. But I had like a physical mail in letter, for it.



34
0:04:51

Emily
Oh, God, okay. So it was. It was for this Copay.



35
0:04:54
P9
Ye, yeah. And then I called the Va. About it. I I did it through the phone, and then it was I believe it was for my heel, because I did my



36
0:05:03

P9
my Achilles. And then, since they they tore my Achilles and not like completely. But it was like almost completely ruptured. But



37
0:05:12
P9
They.



38
0:05:14

P9
since they couldn't get the appointment, for in the next 30 days I they had to go outside. I believe it was for that.



39
0:05:22
P9
And then I called the Va. About it. Because they got the letter. And they told them, Yeah, it's supposed to be like for free.



40
0:05:30

Emily
Oh, God, okay, alright! So outside of that, it sounds like you. You have not received Copays or or have there other vendors.



41
0:05:36
P9
Have



42
0:05:38

P9
a while ago from one of my prescription, but had since stopped taking my my prescription, for, like antidepressant anti-anxiety. It's kinda like, you know.



43
0:05:49
P9
didn't want to take any of that anymore. So like, that's that's where I receive A click.



44
0:05:56

Emily
Okay, got it.



45
0:05:57
Emily
And is that you said you had received a letter any other way, that you were given information about these past copays.



46
0:06:07

P9
No, it was just a letter that I saw. It was a mail in letter, and there was one more letter asking me. I don't know if this is



47
0:06:16
P9
in relate in relation to my vam



48
0:06:20

P9
what it could benefits. But it's asking me if I use the Va. I believe it was last March.



49
0:06:27
P9
because there's like a bill. I was like, I use my doctor for that, so I don't know how I re. I remember the date, but I got a Va. Letter saying that



50
0:06:37

P9
this is not a bill, but you know it's like a charge.



51
0:06:40
Emily
Oh, okay.



52
0:06:40

P9
Saying that



53
0:06:42
P9
you know, if you use the Va. I was like, no, I use my regular doctor, so I don't know how we'd go through. Va, so I was kind of confused. But yeah, get it.



54
0:06:52

Emily
Okay, and it sounds.



55
0:06:54
P9
It says it's not a bill, but it was like a a bill. It it's not billed to me, but it's just like there's a charge, so I don't.



56
0:07:01

Emily
Okay. Yeah.



57
0:07:02
P9
Confusing.



58
0:07:03

Emily
Yep, that makes sense. I'd be confused, too, as well.



59
0:07:06
Emily
Okay. So it's it sounds like and correct me if I'm wrong that you haven't actually paid any of these co-pays that were sent to you. They were like they were all in error. Is that right?



60
0:07:18

P9
It was, I paid the the copay for the medication that I used to take.



61
0:07:21
Emily
Got it? Okay.



62
0:07:23

Emily
all right. And do you so for that medication, Copay, what? How? How did you know when you needed to make a payment, and what was what was prompting you to make those payments.



63
0:07:34
P9
I got a fiscal letter.



64
0:07:36

Emily
Okay.



65
0:07:38
P9
Through the mail.



66
0:07:40

Emily
Okay, and outside the the one confusion that you certainly mentioned. Anything else, that might be made easier in regards to these copay notifications.



67
0:07:55
P9
I would say an email would be easier. Because



68
0:08:00

P9
like, I said, I didn't start using the app up until like last year, because I was kept on re downloading it to do these these appointments. So I figured just



69
0:08:09
P9
I just you know, download it. I know there's like notifications on there. But like I have all notifications turned off on my phone like I said, like, I know, you have my phone when I work. So like, I'm not gonna get that. So like, usually, I get a lot of my, I prefer like email notification, because you have like a set time to check my emails. And then I go through. Then I see my emails. But as far, no notifications to have.



70
0:08:34

P9
even if I have the Va app right now, all of my notification on my phone. They're just all turned off because they get like distracted so easy. Nothing will. Yeah, not even like a a text message is like, off also. So like, yeah. So I would say, email would be good. But physical mail is also works. But



71
0:08:56
P9
you know, I don't know, like, sometimes, like fiscal mail could be lost. So I could. Yeah.



72
0:09:04

P9
But yeah, I've never got an email bill from the Va. Not that I.



73
0:09:09
Emily
Got it, and then what has been your method for paying these these pre previous co-pays?



74
0:09:16

P9
So usually when I see, like, you know, the Physical Mail, it says, like, go to website a call, I'll just call them. Since I already have it right there.



75
0:09:25
Emily
Yeah, okay, alright, and let me go. Have you go ahead and share your screen?



76
0:09:33

P9
Okay, on my phone. Let me see.



77
0:09:35
Emily
Okay.



78
0:09:39

P9
Okay.



79
0:09:43
P9
Scott. Rocket.



80
0:09:49

Emily
Alright! There we go, perfect and let me have you open up the figma app, and I'm gonna give you a a login to use.



81
0:09:59
Emily
Okay, go ahead and log in.



82
0:10:08

Emily
Okay, so the email that you'll use is VA test 0 0 0@gmail.com.



83
0:10:24
Emily
And the password is gonna be 8 characters. Va repeated 4 times. So Va, all lowercase.



84
0:10:36

Emily
okay? And then I'm gonna get you an authentication code. Give me just a moment.



85
0:10:44
Emily
There we go. Okay, so the code will be 4, 9, 5, 1 0 0 8.



86
0:10:54

Emily
Okay, go ahead and log in.



87
0:11:00
Emily
Okay, continue with the app. And I'm gonna get you a link in just a moment.



88
0:11:06

Emily
Alright, so no need no click on anything quite yet. Let me



89
0:11:11
Emily
I'm gonna send you the link through zoom. So you should see in your zoom chat the link.



90
0:11:28

P9
Do I stop sharing first.st



91
0:11:30
Emily
So just tap in the middle, and at the bottom you should see. Yeah.



92
0:11:34

P9
Oh, I see. Okay.



93
0:11:35
Emily
Yep, there we go so tap in the extra long link there, and if you wanna swipe my image off to the right, then you don't need to



94
0:11:43

Emily
see me. There we go. All right. Give it just a moment



95
0:12:03
Emily
hopefully. This works. Sometimes it's a little on the slower side.



96
0:12:10

Emily
Alright. This seems promising.



97
0:12:14
Emily
Alright. So here we have your pretend app home screen. Here. You can tap outside just anywhere outside of the the little help. There we go perfect. So without I'm not going to have you tap anything quite yet, but from looking around here you can scroll as much as you want. Where would you expect to find these copays that you might owe in this if you were on the app.



98
0:12:40

P9
Payments.



99
0:12:41
Emily
Okay?



100
0:12:43

Emily
Great. And yeah, thoughts on in this. In this scenario, we're going to pretend that you also have overpayment. That's in addition to copays. But thought actually, well, 1st you clearly went straight to payments thoughts on the title of that. Would anything be more clear.



101
0:13:05
P9
No, it literally just says co-pays right there. So it's it's pretty straightforward, you know, unless you don't know what that means.



102
0:13:15

P9
yeah, and overpayment and debts like that's pretty much, you know, outstanding due or same thing. Overpayment debts.



103
0:13:24
P9
it's kind of is that a for overpayment desk.



104
0:13:31

P9
Does that mean like the Va. Overpaid you, and you have to pay them back.



105
0:13:35
Emily
That was exactly what I mean. Yes, yep.



106
0:13:37

P9
Okay, okay, just making sure.



107
0:13:39
Emily
Yeah, yeah, you're right. Yeah. And how about? Okay? So it looks like the things are pretty clear here on this page. How about the specifically the word payments on the bottom right where you would originally tapped. I know you went straight there to find.



108
0:13:57

P9
Yeah.



109
0:13:58
Emily
Yeah, any thoughts on. If that could be even even more clear in terms of where you would find the co-pays.



110
0:14:05

P9
No, actually, that was that was very clear. That's without even like, you know. As soon as you I logged in here



111
0:14:14
P9
when you asked me like, Where would you find your your copays like? That's the 1st thing that came to my mind, like the under payments, because, you know. That's that's where I would expect it to be. That's a that's a very, very clear right there.



112
0:14:27

Emily
Great, all right.



113
0:14:29
Emily
And then thoughts on what information you want might want to see. So like right now, there's a bit of info under both overpayment debts and copays



114
0:14:40

Emily
any thoughts on what would be important to see as a really high level. When you open up this page.



115
0:14:49
P9
Let me see here



116
0:14:54

P9
history, direct deposit.



117
0:15:04
P9
I would maybe not necessary. But



118
0:15:09

P9
your va debt and bills. No, no, actually, that's that's that's right, because you're the one paying I was. I was thinking something else.



119
0:15:17
Emily
Okay.



120
0:15:18

P9
No, I was, I would say, that's that's that's fine right there, because it clearly says, like what you need to pay at the bottom right there, the bottom 2.



121
0:15:27
P9
I was thinking like I was looking for like something that



122
0:15:34

P9
What's that?



123
0:15:37
P9
If I click on one of these like it'll show me the okay, the what they're for.



124
0:15:49

P9
Okay. Now that



125
0:15:50
P9
that looks that looks good because, like these 2 are bundled together, the overpayment it does because those are the. Those are the things that you need to pay, and it it separates the the co-pays with your actual overpayment. That Va



126
0:16:04

P9
that you know that that paid you.



127
0:16:08
P9
Question for these like for over payments? When would be like A, How would that



128
0:16:17

P9
work with a BA Va like they overpaid you.



129
0:16:21
Emily
Yeah.



130
0:16:22

P9
Is your doctor, or.



131
0:16:24
Emily
No, it's not good. I don't. I haven't heard that example. For what example I've heard is if you were signed up for some classes, and then for some reason, had to drop a class, but had already already received the money to take that class. That would be.



132
0:16:39

P9
Okay.



133
0:16:40
Emily
That would be an example of an overpayment.



134
0:16:43

P9
Gotcha. Okay, okay? Got it? No, I think this this this looks good because you have the the co-pays and then and the overpayments separated. So like, you know, exactly like where to go. And if you want to prioritize one or the other, you know.



135
0:16:58
Emily
Okay, great. So for the the co-pays, let me have you tap into that and see about the information presented. And just what you feel would be important for you to know, for the co-pays here.



136
0:17:17

P9
So this one says you have submitted.



137
0:17:25
P9
So for the middle 1, $200, I noticed that



138
0:17:33

P9
these 2, the top and the bottom. It says like



139
0:17:37
P9
when you paid it, and when when it's due.



140
0:17:42

P9
Just wondering why the middle one doesn't say that.



141
0:17:45
Emily
Okay, so is that I'll take from that that you you'd want to know more information on. Why, it says to call instead of.



142
0:17:53

P9
Yeah.



143
0:17:54
Emily
Okay, got it any other?



144
0:17:58

Emily
Because if if I was like, you know, if I had like a.



145
0:18:01
P9
One thing that I would prioritize if if it was me was to have to see exactly when I need to pay it by, you know, like, let's just say like



146
0:18:11

P9
like, I'm 1 of those people like.



147
0:18:13
P9
oh, I have time. I like kind of like procrastinate, even though like debate right now. But I still wanna see, like, you know.



148
0:18:21

P9
right away when when it's gonna be due. So that



149
0:18:25
P9
yeah. So that's 1 of those things.



150
0:18:28

P9
And yeah, for this one. For example.



151
0:18:31
P9
the very bottom says payment submitted.



152
0:18:35

P9
Oh, that's a 0.



153
0:18:36
P9
Okay, so that one's already done right, so there's no balance. So I would say, this one is not necessary then, if it's already



154
0:18:46

P9
paid off it, it should be under like payment history, or something like that which I believe I saw on the previous page.



155
0:18:52
Emily
So you you wouldn't even want to see it right here.



156
0:18:55

P9
No, because like when I click on these, because I would think that when I click on on the the payments,



157
0:19:04
P9
the copays, I would think that these are the ones that are outstanding, not the ones that are, you know... because, like over here. If I go back.



158
0:19:14

P9
I got VA payment history. That's that's where I would think that would go.



159
0:19:18
Emily
Okay, got it. Okay.



160
0:19:19

P9
Yeah.



161
0:19:20
Emily
Okay, yeah. So back into Copays perfect. So looking at that top one, the James A. Haley veteran hospital. What information would you need to know for this one here.



162
0:19:35

P9
So this one is actually perfect right here, like as it is. And then you could review the details because it tells you exactly what you



163
0:19:41
P9
what you need to pay, how much you need to pay. And well, it tells you how much you need to pay, and then, when you need to pay it by. Those are the 2 important



164
0:19:52

P9
or 2 important details right away that I want to see if if it was, you know, if I was looking at something, and then I could go and review details and what it's for, you know.



165
0:20:01
Emily
Okay.



166
0:20:02

Emily
Yeah. Oh, yeah. If you want to go.



167
0:20:04
P9
Right away. What what I want to see is these 2 go ahead.



168
0:20:09

Emily
Yeah, so is that.



169
0:20:10
P9
And then.



170
0:20:10

Emily
Not on this. Hmm.



171
0:20:12
P9
This page. Let me just take a look at it.



172
0:20:17

P9
Script balance 50.



173
0:20:25
P9
Yeah. So this one has a breakdown of everything.



174
0:20:29

P9
But what is this at the bottom?



175
0:20:38
P9
Okay, so this tells me, since it's $50, I have to pay the 1, 2, 3



176
0:20:47

P9
for the 1st 4 is pretty much the breakdown of the $50.



177
0:20:51
Emily
But.



178
0:20:53

P9
This the ones that you've paid already.



179
0:21:01
P9
Okay, so what I'm getting out of this is



180
0:21:05

P9
This is for for pretty much like one let's just say



181
0:21:15
P9
what's the word I'm looking for



182
0:21:18

P9
service. Let's just say like for let's just say this is for your knee, right like, because I have a lot of knee issues for Va, this for my right knee. Let's just put it that way. So these are all the these are all the the co-pays and



183
0:21:32
P9
and past past payments for my right knee.



184
0:21:36

P9
That's just, you know, kind of like you saying it's an example, because I see, like a payment of $45 right here.



185
0:21:42
Emily
Oh, okay, so, so grouped, this is, this is.



186
0:21:44

P9
Their group. Yeah, they're they're group into, like, you know, 1 1, i guess, like medical issue.



187
0:21:50
Emily
Okay, got it.



188
0:21:51

P9
Okay.



189
0:21:52
Emily
What are there?



190
0:21:53

Emily
It's. Oh, yeah, go ahead.



191
0:21:57
P9
I would say over here, I would. I would just put the



192
0:22:07

P9
what I owed for now like, let's say like, because when I click, click on that bill



193
0:22:13
P9
and let me just go back real quick.



194
0:22:15

P9
So when I click on this bill, $50,



195
0:22:18
P9
I would say, separate these actual balances from the payments already received.



196
0:22:26

P9
So that it's clear that's exactly my balance, you know.



197
0:22:31
P9
And then the payment received could be like, yeah, because, like, they're kind of grouped into one. If you look at it.



198
0:22:37

Emily
Okay, got it?



199
0:22:39
Emily
Or early, think, yeah, go ahead.



200
0:22:43

P9
Or just have, like all my



201
0:22:46
P9
the the breakdown of the $50. And then, if you really want to see, like your past payments. You could go to like your statements, or.



202
0:22:55

P9
yeah, so like you could see like your past payments on there. Because



203
0:22:59
P9
If I was looking at it. I just want to see right now, like what the breakdown of the $50 is like.



204
0:23:06

P9
you know, like, if I wanted to see something else like past payments. I could just go like the statements or the the



205
0:23:11
P9
payment history on the 1st page.



206
0:23:14

Emily
Oh, okay, so so it's it's not really clear. Now, just what exactly the the $50 is is from.



207
0:23:21
P9
Yeah. So that's what I'm that's what I'm most concerned about. If I owed $50, to look at what it's for.



208
0:23:30

P9
You know, these 1, 2, 3, 4, right here and then these right here could be a different one. Because when I was looking at when I was scrolling down the



209
0:23:38
P9
what I noticed like I was counting



210
0:23:41

P9
the the amount, the $20 to $5,



211
0:23:45
P9
$5, and the other $20 right here. And then I started seeing the negative 45, and it starts seeing the $5. You know, it's kind of like I understood it like looking at it. But looking at just



212
0:23:56

P9
maybe like other people's, you know, they



213
0:23:59
P9
might cause confusion. But I mean, that's I. I understand, like what it's what it's doing.



214
0:24:06

P9
But it'd be nice to just have that breakdown of the $50 over there.



215
0:24:11
Emily
Okay, good and we're gonna pretend that



216
0:24:17

Emily
that. You you see an error here you like something is listed where you're very sure you, let's say, didn't attend that appointment or something. What would what? What would you do in that in that sense, or in that instance?



217
0:24:31
P9
Okay. So let's say, outpatient care for optometry.



218
0:24:38

P9
Yeah. So let's say, like, if I didn't attend this one, I would.



219
0:24:43
P9
I can click on it.



220
0:24:46

P9
I would. I would try to



221
0:24:48
P9
Yeah, we try to tap on it and see, like, you know, if there's any more information.



222
0:24:52

Emily
Oh, God!



223
0:24:53
P9
If you know. Maybe like provider contact info kind of like to confirm with the provider the office of sales provider



224
0:25:04

P9
that I didn't go that outpatient care for optometry that day, you know, or at least like some somewhere to con contact. Va.



225
0:25:13
P9
yeah, because I can click on anything right now. Maybe it's not done yet.



226
0:25:17

Emily
Yeah. Try scrolling up. I think there's 1 that might be active. Let me see. It's the the the top. Yeah. Would this? Would this at all be helpful to you?



227
0:25:30
Emily
Yeah, it would be helpful, because there's a billing reference right there. It would be nice to.



228
0:25:35

P9
To have like contact information. Because, like, if I was, if I was to look at that, hey? I didn't do this. I wanna be able to like contact whoever I need to right away, instead of like trying to dig in or call the Va like



229
0:25:48
P9
Va general number, which I would get bounced around, you know.



230
0:25:53

Emily
Okay? And so where would you expect to? Since you mentioned calling someone? Where? Where do you believe you would go to look for a number to call.



231
0:26:04
P9
I would try to click on help first.st If I was me like the 1st thing I would do is pop right.



232
0:26:09

Emily
Okay.



233
0:26:10
P9
And see you know what I can find out of there.



234
0:26:13

P9
If not, let me look at the the previous page.



235
0:26:17
P9
Page. If there's any any contact information at all, anywhere.



236
0:26:24

Emily
Was as I.



237
0:26:25
P9
How would?



238
0:26:26

Emily
Yeah. Go ahead.



239
0:26:29
P9
Go ahead. Sorry.



240
0:26:30

Emily
Oh, I was gonna say, since since you mentioned the the help button, if you wanna tap on that here.



241
0:26:41
P9
Okay. So



242
0:26:43

P9
So let's say, let's go back to that 1st one.



243
0:26:47
P9
I don't know if the help is gonna change.



244
0:26:50

Emily
I forget if the help is connected.



245
0:26:52
P9
It is.



246
0:26:52

Emily
It might not be. Oh, it is. Yeah, alright.



247
0:26:55
P9
So it's it's it's a if you have questions about your copay bills. Okay? So



248
0:27:01

P9
you have a. You have the number



249
0:27:04
P9
on here about the copay bill. So yeah, that's that's the 1st thing I would do. So you you guys have that there already. But is this like the just the general number for the Va. Or is this like the number for



250
0:27:20

P9
in regards to this bill.



251
0:27:22
Emily
So what what would I mean as



252
0:27:24

Emily
around? What? What would? What would make it more clear as to what the number actually is that you're seeing.



253
0:27:34
P9
Health resource center.



254
0:27:40

P9
What is this for outpatient care? Family medicine?



255
0:27:47
P9
So this tells me it's more of a general number. But I mean that that would.



256
0:27:54

P9
It would be fine as long as it relates to



257
0:27:59
P9
the actual Va va services that I that I receive rather than just a general Va. Number is that, does that make sense or.



258
0:28:09

Emily
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yes. You do want a more, a more focused number.



259
0:28:12
P9
Yeah, because, like, I've I've had that happen to me before I leave those 2 years ago where



260
0:28:19

P9
I saw a number. It was I was using my my computer, and I saw a number. And I called that number, and they put me on hold to transfer me. And then another transfer. After that.



261
0:28:32
Emily
Got it.



262
0:28:32

P9
So if if this number is actually like, it doesn't have to be the the providers. Actual number, you know, but someone that could help you right away rather than like putting me on hold for them to find out which one it is. And then.



263
0:28:45
P9
you know, yeah. So more like, I guess, like



264
0:28:49

P9
someone that could help me, but not like the the very 1st number that the Va. Would would give you like.



265
0:28:56
Emily
Yeah, okay? And then, you know a similar question. We're gonna pretend that you don't believe you have the money right now to make this payment. What would what might you do in that situation?



266
0:29:10

P9
I would call



267
0:29:12
P9
the the outpatient or not the outpatient. This number right here, and then see if they have, like, some type of like



268
0:29:20

P9
payment plan, or anything like that.



269
0:29:24
P9
Or what would be even more helpful, because, you know, sometimes, like people would rather avoid



270
0:29:32

P9
you know, social interaction when when they're setting up payments. I would, I would think, if they have like, you know, some type of link right here to do like a payment plan.



271
0:29:44
Emily
Hmm, okay.



272
0:29:46

Emily
Where? Where?



273
0:29:47
P9
You said, you know.



274
0:29:48

P9
Oh, where would I?



275
0:29:50
P9
Where would that?



276
0:29:51

P9
Yeah, exactly.



277
0:29:55
P9
So are we talking about? Just just for this



278
0:30:01

P9
for each of them, or just for all of these.



279
0:30:05
Emily
Let's say, for like for like for that, that $50 payment since you mentioned a a repayment plan, where would you hope or believe to find any information regarding a potential repayment plan.



280
0:30:21

P9
I would say.



281
0:30:24
P9
just under payments. Hold on! Let me go back to the payments here, and then over here



282
0:30:33

P9
and pay bill.



283
0:30:39
P9
Is this so when you try to pay a bill, does it go?



284
0:30:44

P9
It doesn't do through the app.



285
0:30:47
Emily
Right.



286
0:30:49

P9
Gotcha. Okay?



287
0:30:52
P9
Yeah. Like, I said, like, when I've done it before. It was by phone when I received the letter. So I've not actually never paid in the app. I don't believe so. That makes sense.



288
0:31:01

P9
So I would say, that's what I would do what I just did right now on the pay bill and see like if there's like a payment plan that I could do.



289
0:31:11
Emily
Got it. Okay. So you.



290
0:31:12

P9
$50. Yeah.



291
0:31:13
Emily
Perfect. Let me have you tap on close here.



292
0:31:18

P9
It won't.



293
0:31:20
Emily
It won't. That's never good.



294
0:31:22

P9
Yeah, no, no. Actually, I'm trying to tap and.



295
0:31:26
Emily
Try typing.



296
0:31:26

Emily
And outside, I might just have to.



297
0:31:29
P9
Yeah.



298
0:31:30

Emily
Go back all right. Nothing is responding. If you're.



299
0:31:35
P9
No.



300
0:31:36

Emily
Okay.



301
0:31:37
P9
Looks like zoom is working, though.



302
0:31:39

Emily
I know one. Why don't you go back to zoom? And then re tap that link from yes, the chat



303
0:31:48
Emily
when in doubt start over. That's my answer to everything. Oh, come on, come on, figma.



304
0:31:54

P9
Let me let me quit Sigma, and then recap that.



305
0:31:59
Emily
That was gonna be my next thing. You read my mind.



306
0:32:06

P9
I wonder if this, if it just got stuck? Let me tap on that again just to



307
0:32:11
Emily
Sometimes it. It just gets slow. Alright, so tap on payment. Tap on Copay.



308
0:32:16

Emily
Yeah, there we go.



309
0:32:20
Emily
So I'll have you swipe. My my.



310
0:32:25

P9
All right.



311
0:32:25
Emily
Getting out of the way.



312
0:32:26

P9
Ouch!



313
0:32:26
Emily
It just a little more space. Yeah.



314
0:32:30

P9
Where did I go for that.



315
0:32:32
Emily
So what?



316
0:32:32

P9
Pay bill. I believe.



317
0:32:33
Emily
I'm gonna have you do one thing first.st



318
0:32:36

Emily
We'll get back to the to the pay bill, but tap on the the help and the help section we were at before.



319
0:32:46
Emily
and if there's anything there that I know you said you would probably call, but if there's anything else that you might there for, or that you might find.



320
0:32:52

P9
Oh!



321
0:32:53
Emily
For repayment.



322
0:32:56

P9
There's how to request debt relief. And if you can't pay future co-pays, that's that's the



323
0:33:02
P9
That stuff.



324
0:33:04

P9
1st thing I would click on the the second one right here or this one.



325
0:33:09
P9
And also if you have questions about your copay bills is one of the ones that I would click on. But if you're wondering what the top one that I would pick if I wanted to. See if there's if there's a payment plan. I would say



326
0:33:24

P9
this one, because, it not, it's not quite debt relief, but



327
0:33:30
P9
I guess like it. It kind of like for me. It kind of sounds like it's more in the on the side of like, okay, like, what can I do to like get help to make payments and anything like that?



328
0:33:41

Emily
Okay. Can you think of? Would there be anything that would make that even more clear? To to go there for any sort of debt, relief.



329
0:33:52
P9
So I guess, like what we're talking about is to make payment plans right a debt. Relief is more like



330
0:34:00

P9
trying to ask if there's a way for you to to waive your



331
0:34:05
P9
your co-pays or your debt, so I guess, like



332
0:34:10

P9
it would be more clear. Let's say like, if



333
0:34:15
P9
if I go to like, if you have questions about your bills like, if it has like information about like this to to request for payment plan.



334
0:34:23

P9
you know. Yeah, like deferred payments or anything like that.



335
0:34:29
P9
I just thought about that that, really, because, like, I kind of bundled it into one where you know payment plan, and that really.



336
0:34:36

P9
But I guess they're different. Because if you're asking for debt relief that means just kind of like wipe it out, or something, or wave it.



337
0:34:43
Emily
Okay? So would could, could that be more clear here in terms of finding what's available.



338
0:34:50

P9
Yeah, I would say, like, if you guys could either have it under this. If you have questions about your call.



339
0:34:59
P9
pay bills have like A, you know. If you have questions about your bills or want to do



340
0:35:06

P9
payment plan, it could be under here also. Or if you, wanna but another



341
0:35:13
P9
drop down saying about like something about



342
0:35:18

P9
payment plans. But you know you don't.



343
0:35:21
P9
But at the same time you don't want this to be filled up with a lot of drop downs.



344
0:35:26

P9
So



345
0:35:27
P9
let's say like, if you want to keep it as is with 4 4 dropdowns, you could put it right here.



346
0:35:35

Emily
Okay. Yeah.



347
0:35:36
P9
Because, you know, that's more like, yeah, that's more like a question.



348
0:35:39

Emily
Got it? Got it? Okay? And then



349
0:35:41
Emily
How oral, were you aware that there are these options that you're seeing here of like requesting debt, relief, and and finding information on on a payment plan. Things like that.



350
0:35:56

P9
No, I actually did not know anything about like a debt relief from Va. Because I figured.



351
0:36:01
P9
you know, if you owe something you just kinda owe something. But then, you know, it's



352
0:36:05

P9
it's different people's



353
0:36:10
P9
You know, people people have like different situation in life so that they may need it.



354
0:36:18

Emily
Okay, got it. I'll have you tap on close here.



355
0:36:23
Emily
Okay, so



356
0:36:26

Emily
Other things you would expect or or hope to be able to do from here.



357
0:36:34
P9
Let me just look around real quick. See what else it has.



358
0:36:44

P9
There's a statement



359
0:36:53
P9
yeah. So like, just what I mentioned earlier about having the



360
0:36:57

P9
co-pay separated with your previous payments, because



361
0:37:02
P9
I just for for me like it just has nothing to do with with my co-pay.



362
0:37:08

P9
Right now, what I'm worried about is what I need to pay, and when I need to pay it so.



363
0:37:15
P9
I would just say, just keep these 4 right here.



364
0:37:19

P9
And then I see the Pdf statement right there. Also. It's it's at the top and the bottom. So that's good.



365
0:37:25
Emily
Okay.



366
0:37:27

P9
So yeah, that's.



367
0:37:29
Emily
Are, are Pdf. Statements something that you use now for anything.



368
0:37:33

P9
Yeah. So let's just say, not for



369
0:37:38
P9
like in particular from Va, but like, let's just say like banking information, right? I see. Like just the the rundown of what I have. But if I want to dig into it, then that's when I would use the Pdf statement. So



370
0:37:51

P9
if if I if I have like my previous payments, that's where I was, that's where I would expect it, I believe.



371
0:37:59
P9
And yeah, so that's that's what I would. That's what I would go if I really want to like, you know. Audit everything.



372
0:38:07

Emily
What I paid and what I owed. Yeah.



373
0:38:09
Emily
hmm, okay, and let me have you open up one of the statements here to see if just how how useful that might be here on the app.



374
0:38:20

Emily
So pretend you've opened up this statement here.



375
0:38:24
Emily
So is this something, I guess. How? How would you use the statements? And I said you would like audit things?



376
0:38:33

Emily
Specifically, on.



377
0:38:34
P9
Yeah.



378
0:38:35

Emily
Phone. How might you use it?



379
0:38:39
P9
So I would go directly to like the oh, actually this! Let me see here it might be. Let me just zoom it in.



380
0:38:46

Emily
So if you tap once, that's yeah. If if you tap once.



381
0:38:49
P9
Okay.



382
0:38:50

Emily
A little fake zoom.



383
0:38:51
P9
Got it.



384
0:38:52

Emily
Prototype, limitation.



385
0:38:54
P9
Okay, so it it says right here.



386
0:38:57

P9
all of my my charges, which is pretty much the same thing as the the one in the front.



387
0:39:03
P9
The not the front, the the previous page, and it doesn't have your previous statement of.



388
0:39:14

P9
I would think that, you know, like,



389
0:39:16
P9
I guess statement balances just for the month.



390


395
0:40:02
Emily
Okay. Got it? Alright. Let me have you tap on done there, please.



396
0:40:07

P9
So we're pretending that if if this is built in real life, if the if the app had this section in real life here, like you're seeing.



397
0:40:17
Emily
How likely do you think it would be that you might use it.



398
0:40:23

P9
The the Pdf. Statements.



399
0:40:26
Emily
Really this, this whole thing that would that we've looked at. So, viewing this, viewing the information, looking at the Pdf, seeing when things are due.



400
0:40:35

P9
I would use it if



401
0:40:39
P9
you know, if it's actually, if it's usable right now, I I would. I would say it's it's usable as it is. I understand it.



402
0:40:46

P9
And if let's say because the Pdf is A



403
0:40:52
P9
is very minimal, I would say that



404
0:40:56

P9
it may not really be needed



405
0:40:59
P9
for me, like, let's say, like, if I'm just looking at the



406
0:41:02

P9
statements, because, like for for va statements, S.



407
0:41:07
P9
Got it for me, at least like for me. It would be very rare to have like



408
0:41:13

P9
a lot of a lot of information there on the on the Pdf. Statements so like.



409
0:41:20
P9
I will just have them in a page



410
0:41:22

P9
and then make this make it still available via Pdf statement. But like I would just have everything in the pages like this, but separate



411
0:41:31
P9
your your what you need to pay with these. I would use this if



412
0:41:37

P9
you know, if I just need to. I need to look at it and pay it on the app rather than



413
0:41:43
P9
calling the phone. It'd be much easier if I could just pay in the app, too.



414
0:41:47

Emily
Okay? Good. Yeah. So since you specifically mentioned paying in the app. And right now, this version is not would that. Would that be still be something that that you would use, knowing that there wasn't the option to pay right here.



415
0:42:02
P9
Actually, I would rather use that than to call, because the reason why I paid over the phone before when I got the physical mails is like to call this number.



416
0:42:10

Emily
Hmm.



417
0:42:11
P9
So.



418
0:42:12

Emily
Yep. Okay.



419
0:42:13
P9
That's that's what it's in front of me.



420
0:42:15

Emily
Yes, got it all right. Let me have you tap on the payments in the lower right? I'm gonna get you to another version, and we're gonna quickly go with that and so scroll all the way to the bottom



421
0:42:27
Emily
and tap on the blank gray area toward the bottom. There, yeah, there we go, perfect. And now tap on Copays.



422
0:42:35

Emily
Okay? So again, we're going to go through again. That top one, the James A. Haley hospital



423
0:42:42
Emily
walk me through. We'll pretend that you are ready to pay. Walk me through. How you would do that. Here.



424
0:42:52

P9
Yes, so let's just say I already reviewed it. I'm ready to pay.



425
0:42:56
P9
I'll just click on pay bills, and if there's a hey? You know I'm



426
0:43:05

P9
I would pay in pay.gov.



427
0:43:07
P9
since there's you know, it'll take you to a website, anyway, instead of paying by phone or by mail definitely not pay by mail. I wouldn't even do that.



428
0:43:18

P9
Yeah, I would just pay and pay.gov.



429
0:43:21
Emily
Oh, there you go! You could click this time around.



430
0:43:24

P9
And then.



431
0:43:25
Emily
Go ahead and do that.



432
0:43:27

Emily
I won't. I won't have you enter anything in, I promise.



433
0:43:35
Emily
And I'm gonna I'm gonna skip most that. But scroll down a little bit. I'm gonna have you go to continue to the form the blue one there.



434
0:43:45

Emily
Okay, and then scroll down a little more. We're just going to get you to the one specific area. So the the account number thoughts on



435
0:43:55
Emily
finding the information you would need in order to make the payment, and where, where.



436
0:44:00

P9
Ah yes



437
0:44:01
Emily
Active fines, I would say.



438
0:44:03

P9
I would click on "where do I find my VA account number?" Because I don't know that off top of my head. Or, if I do have it any of my paper mail.



439
0:44:14
P9
mail.



440
0:44:15

Emily
Okay. Okay.



441
0:44:17
P9
yeah. But usually, if I'm already here, I would just click on that. How? Where do I find the account? Number.



442
0:44:24

Emily
Yeah, okay, and let me have you switch back to the figma app.



443
0:44:29
Emily
See? If it wants to cooperate.



444
0:44:35

Emily
Okay? And click on, go back and then close



445
0:44:41
Emily
and let me have you go into review details there?



446
0:44:48

Emily
Oh, sorry of the yes, there we go.



447
0:44:53
Emily
Thoughts on. Oh, yeah, go ahead.



448
0:44:56

P9
There's pay bill right here.



449
0:44:58
Emily
Okay.



450
0:45:00

P9
Okay, so same thing. Yeah, I would. I would pay and pay that golf.



451
0:45:04
Emily
Okay, how about getting that? I know you said you would you would look up where to find the account number.



452
0:45:12

P9
Yeah, it's a i see it there, and I would just copy it.



453
0:45:16
Emily
Okay.



454
0:45:17

P9
So that's very helpful right there, because so is this account number the



455
0:45:24
P9
the Your Va. Account number? Or is this the account number of that bill?



456
0:45:29

Emily
A great question I do not know, but I know it's the one you would need in pay.gov. So.



457
0:45:34
P9
Okay.



458
0:45:35

Emily
Sure what the what? The full number is. Okay? So you would. You would copy that there anything else that might make it even easier for you in terms of getting that in that account. Information over to pay.gov.



459
0:45:51
P9
I would say, can I go back real quick to co-pace.



460
0:45:55

Emily
Yep.



461
0:45:57
P9
Oops. I click over, clicked it.



462
0:46:02

P9
I would say like, because if I was ready to, unless I'm ready and review details.



463
0:46:08
P9
Then I would see it there.



464
0:46:09

P9
But if I was, you know, like if I just if I didn't want to review the details already know it. Let's just say, let's put it this way. So I reviewed the details because I do this all like all the time



465
0:46:21
P9
I would review the details, and I know I have like



466
0:46:24

P9
25 days to pay it off. I'm like, Okay, well, I'll I'll pay it off later. I don't know why I do that. Just a procrastinator, I guess. But already know the the information. So I would go back, maybe 2 weeks later, and I want to pay the bill already. Right? What I would do usually be, since I already know I would just pay the bill.



467
0:46:45
P9
It'd be nice to have that information there. The the account number.



468
0:46:50

Emily
Hmm, okay. Oh, like right here.



469
0:46:54
P9
Yeah, because like, I said, like, that's the type of thing that I would do



470
0:47:00

P9
is I would review it. And then, okay, it's good to go. I'll pay it later. I I don't know. Why did I just do it? But you know it's 1 of those situations where I go back to Va



471
0:47:11
P9
app, you know, if if I was to use the app



472
0:47:15

P9
and then I would just click on pay Bill, because I already know what the bill is.



473
0:47:18
Emily
Yeah, okay.



474
0:47:19

P9
And then I would just follow this prompt, and then I would go to Va. Pay, pay.gov, and then now have to click on. Where do I find it? And then now go back to the app, get it, and then put it there. It'd be nice to have it right there already, you know.



475
0:47:32
Emily
Yeah, okay, got it? And then so knowing having this experience where at least it it is possible to pay, even though I know it's switching applications. What would be the likelihood? You would use this version if it were built in real life.



476
0:47:50

P9
I would rather use this version, because.



477
0:47:53
Emily
Okay.



478
0:47:53

P9
It. It'll you know.



479
0:47:55
P9
I I avoid like calling and being on hold, or anything like that, I could just pay it off online. Easy.



480
0:48:03

P9
Like, I said. The only reason why I paid it through phones because it was right there, and it told me it like to



481
0:48:09
P9
call or mail, or something like that, so I was like, alright, let me just call this, take care of it, but.



482
0:48:14

Emily
Okay, got it? Got it?



483
0:48:16
Emily
Okay? I think those are all my questions. Anything else that you haven't already shared in regards to, let's say, any of the labeling of the section, or just any of the other experiences regarding the Copays here.



484
0:48:34

P9
no, I would say, like, those are the the concerns that I that I you know that I have, but especially the the pay bill. That's probably one of the the bigger ones that I that I want to mention is to have the account number somewhere already.



485
0:48:49
Emily
Yeah, okay.



486
0:48:51

P9
Yeah. So that's like one of the big ones.



487
0:48:54
Emily
Alright makes sense alright, and I'm just gonna check in with my colleagues. If anybody else has any quick questions, feel free to unmute now and ask them.



488
0:49:09

Emily
Okay, I'll take that as a no, and we are a minute over time, and I do apologize. But thank you so much for taking the time to go over this with us. It's super important for us to actually talk with veterans and see how you are experiencing the various things that we are looking to build. So thank you for taking the time with us today.



489
0:49:31
P9
No worries, thank you for for doing this. Make make it easier, for you know, for us.



490
0:49:38

Emily
Working on.



491
0:49:38
P9
Been calling.



492
0:49:40

Emily
Yes, exactly, that's the goal. Alright, thanks so much. Hope. You have a great rest of the day.



493
0:49:46
P9
Thank you, you, too. Bye.



1
00:00:00

Emily
Ask those questions.



2
00:00:01
Emily
ask those questions again. So to confirm, are you okay? If I record our video and audio as we talk today.



3
00:00:09

P10
It's no problem.



4
00:00:11
Emily
Yeah, great. Thank you. And then, are you okay? If we potentially use some clips to show our Va partners from today.



5
00:00:18

P10
Yes.



6
00:00:19
Emily
Okay, great. Thank you.



7
00:00:20

Emily
So first, st just overall questions I love and and whatever you are comfortable sharing, I'd love to know a bit about yourself as a veteran could be. What branch you served when you retired or separated.



8
00:00:34
P10
So I was in [redacted]. I was in from 2,007 to 2,011.



9
00:00:39

Emily
Okay, great. And what sort of interaction and experience have you had with the Va. Since then?



10
00:00:49
P10
So I 1st got [redacted] in 2017, and and and June



11
00:00:56

P10
I got [redacted]. So.



12
00:00:59
Emily
Got it. Okay.



13
00:00:59

P10
So I've been dealing with the Va. For about 7 years. I guess.



14
00:01:04
Emily
Alright.



15
00:01:05

P10
So any gears, I guess.



16
00:01:08
Emily
Yeah. Okay, and oh, sorry. Go ahead.



17
00:01:13

P10
Up into like vas from [redacted] as well. So I've been.



20
00:01:26
P10
To quite a few different vas.



21
00:01:28

Emily
Yeah, sounds like it, all right.



22
00:01:30
Emily
And what sort of experience have you had with the with with Va's website? And or the mobile app.



23
00:01:39

P10
I've been using both quite regularly since 2017. I've seen, like all the improvements that they've made over the years. It's definitely become a lot more user friendly. And then I've been seeing the updates that's been added to the app in the last couple of years as well. So.



24
00:01:58
Emily
Okay.



25
00:01:59

P10
I would say, the advancement of the softwares, and everything like that has been



26
00:02:07
P10
pretty good it's been has been slowly modernized.



27
00:02:13

Emily
Nice, alright and in excuse me. In what? Instances? Would you use choose to use the mobile app over the website.



28
00:02:24
P10
The mobile app. I can just do like the 2 step authentication with my finger, or whatever. So it's definitely quicker.



29
00:02:34

P10
And



30
00:02:37
P10
if I so pretty much, you can do everything, I believe, on the mobile app, except like, do travel claims.



31
00:02:46

P10
yeah. So it's it's



32
00:02:48
P10
it's comparable to the to the website. Now, there's a few things that you can't do on the mobile app but prime all the primary thing task and everything you can just do from your phone. That's what I've noticed.



33
00:03:01

Emily
Okay, got it. And so you said, Is it you mentioned the the authentication? So is it. Is it easier on the mobile app. Is that why you're choosing that I just wanna make sure I'm understanding when you're.



34
00:03:12
P10
Yes, faster, it's faster. It takes seconds. It takes seconds if I do it, to go through the website I have to



35
00:03:20

P10
go through if id me, and maybe it takes like a minute



36
00:03:25
P10
to go through that process. So.



37
00:03:29

Emily
Okay, got it great. So now we're moving on to the financial portion of the discussion. And I want to make sure you're only sharing what you are willing. I have absolutely no information about you or your finances for the Va. So 1st have you had experience with owing the Va. Money for things like benefit, overpayments.



38
00:03:52
P10
Yeah. So I was in school from [redacted]. And I was in the [redacted] program. So there was a overpayment



39
00:04:05

P10
and I think December of last year it finally got paid off. So they took like [redacted] bucks a month, for



40
00:04:13
P10
I don't know. Maybe a year, I think.



41
00:04:15

Emily
Got it.



42
00:04:17
Emily
Okay? So so it sounds like that was paid off by your your benefits being reduced. Is that right?



43
00:04:23

P10
It they got it automatically withdrew from my monthly deposit.



44
00:04:27
Emily
Got it. Okay, all right. And do you recall how you originally notified of this debt?



45
00:04:36

P10
So I wasn't notified.



46
00:04:38
Emily
You weren't okay.



47
00:04:40

P10
I wasn't notified.



48
00:04:42
P10
And then I just I just happened to look at my deposit amounts one day.



49
00:04:47

P10
and I was like, Oh, that doesn't look right. So I end up calling the BA. And then they end up explaining to me that



50
00:04:56
P10
I had a school payment overpayment, so.



51
00:05:04

P10
I may have received the letter, but I do not recall receiving a letter.



52
00:05:08
Emily
Okay. They they said they had milled one.



53
00:05:11

P10
Yeah.



54
00:05:11
Emily
Got it. Okay.



55
00:05:14

P10
And then, like on the on the website. If you see like overpayments, it never showed up there.



56
00:05:22
Emily
Oh, okay, interesting. Okay. So it wouldn't. Didn't show up there.



57
00:05:24

Emily
Good.



58
00:05:25
P10
It didn't show up at all, so I was just getting deducted. That [redacted] bucks, and the only way I knew what it was is, I have to call and confirm.



59
00:05:35

Emily
Hmm, okay.



60
00:05:37
Emily
Got it? Alright. And then thoughts on how that whole process could have been made easier for you.



61
00:05:48

P10
Some type of.



62
00:05:50
P10
I mean, we live in a kind of a digital world these days. So some type of notification within the app or some type of email notification would have.



63
00:06:02

P10
Helped. Because.



64
00:06:06
P10
yeah, I mean, sometimes the the Va knows you multiple letters when you're going through the claims process. You're going through appointments and stuff like that. And every letter, if I get it digitally



65
00:06:19

P10
like I may not open up the mail immediately. So just having some type of digital notification would have



66
00:06:27
P10
assisted me. And you know, understanding what was happening.



67
00:06:30

Emily
Got it. Okay.



68
00:06:32
Emily
sounds good. Okay. And then, switching gears a tiny bit. Have you had any experience with paying any medical co-payments through the Va.



69
00:06:44

P10
I think I only did it once, and that's when I 1st got a service connected. I think it was in [redated] only did only did a a copayment once, and it was like $50 ago. Since then I have never paid anything.



70
00:07:02
Emily
Okay. Got it? Alright. So let me have you have you share your screen now, and let me know if you need any help doing that.



71
00:07:12

P10
Okay.



72
00:07:27
P10
you just hit the share button right?



73
00:07:30

Emily
Yep.



74
00:07:31
P10
And then.



75
00:07:32

Emily
Extra permissions.



76
00:07:34
P10
And then screen. After that.



77
00:07:36

Emily
Yep.



78
00:07:44
P10
So it was giving me a list. Do I choose zoom.



79
00:07:47

Emily
Yeah. So it's 2. Zoom should probably be at the bottom. It's usually alphabetical.



80
00:07:50
P10
Yeah, yeah, it's disabled art.



81
00:07:57

Emily
Alright great and then let me have you share screen. So let me have you open up the mobile app figma. Now.



82
00:08:10
P10
Okay.



83
00:08:24

P10
I have it opened.



84
00:08:25
Emily
Okay. And I'm gonna get so go to login. I'm gonna give you some test credentials. Here.



85
00:08:39

P10
All right.



86
00:08:40
Emily
Okay, so the email is going to be VA test 0 0



87
00:08:51

Emily
at gmail.com.



88
00:08:59
P10
And the password is gonna be VAVA VAVA.



89
00:09:04

Emily
8 characters.



90
00:09:12
Emily
Okay? And I'll just need to get the authentication code. So give me just a moment.



91
00:09:20

Emily
Okay, it's gonna okay. Code is 6, 0, 6,



92
00:09:28
Emily
7, 9, 7, 3.



93
00:09:39

Emily
All right, continue with the app.



94
00:09:49
Emily
Okay? And then I'm gonna send a link to the Zoom chat.



95
00:09:56

Emily
If you can switch back to zoom and open up that message to tap on this link.



96
00:10:17
P10
It's an error.



97
00:10:19

Emily
Can you switch back to let me see if it's not available? Try again. Go go back to zoom.



98
00:10:29
Emily
Yeah.



99
00:10:44

P10
Do I need to do this right here? Tap.



100
00:10:46
Emily
No, that you can just tap anywhere outside of that. It just it. Sometimes it's a little bit slow, but it looks like it's working.



101
00:10:55

P10
Okay.



102
00:10:56
Emily
Yeah, there we go. All right. We have it here. Okay, so here we have our fake mobile app here.



103
00:11:04

Emily
So first, st without any sort of tapping. You can scroll around, certainly, but just don't tap. Don't yet tap into anything. Where would you expect to find information on money that you owe specifically for overpayments?



104
00:11:26
P10
I mean it should be on this 1st page.



105
00:11:28

P10
I would think it would be right below last payment.



106
00:11:31
Emily
Okay, what?



107
00:11:36

P10
Something that was like. I don't know if you're getting.



108
00:11:40
Emily
It. It'd be what sorry I missed that.



109
00:11:43

P10
I said. If there was some like itemized thing right below last payment showing deductions that would be.



110
00:11:49
P10
I think that's where it should be, or even on the payments. Page.



111
00:11:53

Emily
Okay. Got it



112
00:11:56
Emily
all right. Thoughts on. Since you mentioned that that payments page thoughts on the the title of that.



113
00:12:05

P10
Payments.



114
00:12:06
Emily
Yep.



115
00:12:13

P10
I mean, I think the the title is clear. I mean.



116
00:12:21
P10
yeah, I think I mean, I think it's fine.



117
00:12:23

Emily
Okay, great. I'll have you tap into that. Since you mentioned that the the payments, tab.



118
00:12:29
P10
Okay.



119
00:12:29

Emily
Okay.



120
00:12:31
Emily
and in this scenario we will. We will pretend that you that you also have medical copays. But thoughts on what you're seeing here, especially as it relates to the the title of payments.



121
00:12:46

P10
I mean, this is.



122
00:12:48
P10
I mean this. This makes sense like the overpayment for debts and co-pays listed here on this page. This makes sense.



123
00:12:57

P10
So.



124
00:12:59
Emily
Okay, got it. And how about the the bit of information that is below the words overpayment debts and below Copays? What sort of information. Might you want to know? There.



125
00:13:13

P10
If I click the arrow, would it list what it's for?



126
00:13:17
Emily
We'll we'll we'll get to that very shortly. But I'm I'm wondering what like what might be the most helpful specifically from this screen to know, for either the overpayment or the co-pays.



127
00:13:32

P10
I think this information is pretty clear like it says the total amount, and then the number of different debts you owe, and then, for the co-pays



128
00:13:42
P10
has a total, and then there's 2 bills. So I mean with



129
00:13:49

P10
I mean, normally, you should know a veteran should know if they have some type of overpayment



130
00:13:56
P10
or copays due cause.



131
00:13:58

P10
When you go to



132
00:14:01
P10
you should get some receipt or notification, or something like that. When you go to the Va. Or to an outpatient clinic for the co-pays



133
00:14:09

P10
and



134
00:14:11
P10
for the debts. I mean. I'm pretty sure a lot of veterans are watching their deposits every month, so



135
00:14:21

P10
If they got overpaid they probably know.



136
00:14:24
Emily
Got it. Okay? Great so if you want, you can tap into the overpayment debt. Since we talked about that.



137
00:14:31

P10
Okay.



138
00:14:32

P12
I don't know. Maybe highlighted or put it in a different color. Maybe that would make it stand out more so people just don't look cause if me, I didn't even read the 1st sentence, but because I I knew like the I've done this before. But.



207
0:26:19

Emily
Okay.



208
0:26:20
P12
If I was a 1st time user, I would just be like, Oh, the 1st thing will catch my eye, was the current balance.



209
0:26:25

Emily
Okay.



210
0:26:26
P12
And the file number, and then all this information, and then



211
0:26:31

P12
maybe that sentence should be after.



212
0:26:35
Emily
Oh, okay.



213
0:26:36

P12
After instead of before. So that way, they are like, Okay, what I do with all this information.



214
0:26:43
P12
But yeah, that would be helpful to do it after, or maybe highlight. It.



215
0:26:48

Emily
Okay, got it. And then so provided someone know, like, you know, that you would need that information, thoughts on actually filling out that payment site. Knowing that the information you need is here.



216
0:27:05
P12
You mean how my thoughts on filling this stuff out right here.



217
0:27:10

Emily
Yeah. And again, I'm not gonna no, don't don't type anything. I'm not gonna.



218
0:27:12
P12
Model, yeah.



219
0:27:13

Emily
Anything. I don't want you to pretend to pay anything here.



220
0:27:18
P12
I think it's pretty straightforward.



221
0:27:21

Emily
Okay.



222
0:27:23
P12
Let me see.



223
0:27:29

P12
72 education.



224
0:27:32
Emily
What would be your process for specifically getting, let's say, the all all that piece of information into this site, like from the app into this payment site.



225
0:27:57

P12
I don't know. I feel like that wouldn't be safe.



226
0:27:59
P12
I mean, if somebody wants to pay someone else's debt. But I feel that if they, another thing that you could do is if they click on it, it could generate. But then it wouldn't go to this page. It would just go to the 1st page, and people would have to actually click on pay online to get to this part right here.



227
0:28:18

P12
And so the initial page might.



228
0:28:26
P12
yeah, I feel like you could just pay online and then read this stuff.



229
0:28:32

P12
Good job.



230
0:28:34
Emily
So if if you if you did did want to pay online, yeah, how? How exactly would you get? I think if there's like an account number or something. Knowing it's in the app, how? How would you then get that into the pay site here.



231
0:28:52

P12
Oh, just copy and paste it.



232
0:28:55
Emily
Okay, you copy and paste.



233
0:28:57

Emily
Okay, got it?



234
0:29:02
P12
Available.



235
0:29:03

Emily
Okay? So then,



236
0:29:05
Emily
if this, if if what we're viewing now is is built in real life, the the app. If you want actually switch back to figma. Just so we're looking at just the app perfect. Yes, if if it were built as is here with that link to the payment site and the information here. Thoughts on the likelihood of using it as is.



237
0:29:30

P12
As this part.



238
0:29:32
Emily
Yeah, that's the whole thing. Oh, yeah, go ahead.



239
0:29:35

P12
I would definitely



240
0:29:37
P12
use it if it had all this information, because there would no need to go to my laptop, because everything would be here.



241
0:29:45

Emily
Okay?



242
0:29:49
Emily
And then they can know the answer just to confirm so comparing the version this version here, where the there's the payment option versus the original version that didn't have any payment option. Thoughts on



243
0:30:06

Emily
which one you'd be more likely to use.



244
0:30:09
P12
Oh, I would for sure be likely to use this one because it's like a 1 stop shop.



245
0:30:15

Emily
Hmm, okay, okay.



246
0:30:20
Emily
And alright, and then any other thoughts on from this page any other information that would be useful for you.



247
0:30:34

P12
Nope.



248
0:30:36
Emily
Okay, great. Let me have you tap on payments in the lower right.



249
0:30:42

Emily
and then let's go to Copays



250
0:30:46
Emily
again. We're going to pretend that you have medical copays in this pretend scenario here.



251
0:30:53

Emily
Thoughts on oh, you know I'm sorry I totally skipped something. Let me have you.



252
0:31:01
Emily
go back to payments. I just forgot one thing and go back to overpayment debts.



253
0:31:07

Emily
So yeah, any just wanna make sure any other



254
0:31:11
Emily
thing to add, if you let's say we're



255
0:31:15

Emily
not sure you would be able to pay. I think we went through some of this before. But yeah, thoughts on where you'd be. Find that information just anything else to add, for how useful that would be.



256
0:31:28
P12
I think it's if I had questions, I would say resolved it, and then I would request help.



257
0:31:35

P12
And then it would give me



258
0:31:38
P12
a lot of questions or a lot of options to



259
0:31:43

P12
do whatever I need to do with whatever I felt like was I need to do for the debt. So I think this is really useful. That it's



260
0:31:53
P12
there.



261
0:31:56

P12
And that all the options are under there.



262
0:31:58
Emily
Got it. Okay, got it? And were you aware of any options like this of like disputing or or getting help financially?



263
0:32:14

P12
If I read my paperwork. Yes.



264
0:32:17
Emily
I know.



265
0:32:17

P12
I I cause I already knew I owed debt, and so I didn't need to dispute it. But I think on the paperwork there is a number on the letter that I can call to ask questions, and I'm not really sure if I'm sure that there was like



266
0:32:32
P12
a number to call for help to, or it was all the same, if I had questions regarding anything



267
0:32:39

P12
with the debt. So yes.



268
0:32:45
Emily
Okay, got it.



269
0:32:47

Emily
Okay? And



270
0:32:51
Emily
okay. Now, let me have you go tap on payments. We're gonna get back to the co-pays where I'd start to have you go. There we go.



271
0:33:00

Emily
So thoughts here again, pretending that you had some medical Copays thoughts on the information presented here, and just what you would find useful



272
0:33:28
Emily
for the statements. Do you? Are there any scenarios now where you are looking at statements? It could be with with anything financial in your life.



273
0:33:38

P12
Well, I look at the whenever I get community care through the Va. They send me the statements. I mean. Not that I have to pay. They're not bills. They're just like letting me know that



274
0:33:49
P12
I don't have to pay anything. So I still have to look at those statements.



275
0:33:52

Emily
Hmm! But.



276
0:33:53
P12
So I get those pretty often.



277
0:33:55

Emily
Okay.



278
0:33:57
P12
But



279
0:34:03

Emily
And thoughts on viewing a statement here within within the app.



280
0:34:08
P12
I think that's perfect. That it's here.



281
0:34:14

P12
As long as that. The date for the description is the date that they visited, or they received the medication, because I know sometimes those dates can be



282
0:34:25
P12
off, sometimes. And that confuses people, or I know that's confused me before, where the dates don't match up. So I'm like, Hey, I never went to this appointment on this date. But that's what the like



283
0:34:40

P12
community care paperwork says. So I just wanna make sure.



284
0:34:45
P12
Yeah, cause here it says the outpatient care was on June 20 second. And so it matches here. So they should know that that's the date that they had their appointment.



285
0:34:57

Emily
And then for the statements. I know you said so. You would look at them, view them. Would you be doing anything else with these statements?



286
0:35:06
P12
if I need to share some information with



287
0:35:12

P12
A doctor show proof that I did pay it. If they said I didn't pay it. I'll just keep it for my records.



288
0:35:18
Emily
Okay?



289
0:35:19

Emily
And what would be your process for keeping it.



290
0:35:24
P12
I would probably save it on my drive. But not download on my phone, probably on my computer.



291
0:35:30

Emily
Hmm.



292
0:35:30
P12
Or I probably print it, but if I don't.



293
0:35:39

P12
there's just so many letters I get from the Va. So I feel like they do. The Va. Does a really good job at making sure that there's paper copies of everything that you have.



294
0:35:52
P12
So as long as that the paper copies are sent out automatically, like they are, it wouldn't be nice to have it online for people that are more tech savvy? But I honestly just like the paper, because it's less memory on my phone or my computer. And I just have, I just have a file that I put on my Va stuff on there and just file it away and call it a day.



295
0:36:13

P12
Okay, good.



296
0:36:14
Emily
Okay.



297
0:36:15

P12
But I mean I can see how it could be useful just to kind of get an overview of all these individual



298
0:36:21
P12
charges.



299
0:36:25

P12
Yeah.



300
0:36:26
Emily
And then how about if you were looking for any pre like older statements.



301
0:36:33

P12
I think I'd go to Pdf statement.



302
0:36:35
Emily
Okay.



303
0:36:37

P12
Oh, yeah, it doesn't click. Yeah, go to Pdf statements. And hopefully, they have like, it's by date or time or appointment time or whatever.



304
0:36:47
Emily
Okay, thoughts on the ease or difficulty in in finding some of those older statements.



305
0:37:02

P12
Well, this person doesn't seem to have like a lot of stuff, but if I wonder what it would look like if there's like a max that's on this page before it gets to the bottom. Because if somebody did get seen pretty often, did they have to scroll like a long way before they get to the bottom, and would they know it's down there? So I wonder if there's like a limit on what they can see like 4 or 5 appointments until they get to the bottom. Cause I know that I get seen weekly.



306
0:37:28
Emily
Hmm.



307
0:37:28

P12
So if I were trying to look, I wouldn't want to scroll all the way down, because I'm like, oh, they're just appointments on appointments and appointments and appointments. So I think there should be a Max of how many they can see and then go to a different page, and then they can see the Pdf. Statements at the, so they know that there's things at the bottom.



308
0:37:45
Emily
Okay, got it? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay?



309
0:37:50

Emily
And then, so it's a similar question with the overpayments. Let's say, here, you noticed what you believe is an error could be like you didn't actually attend this, the particular appointment for the outpatient care. What would be your next step if you notice that that error there.



310
0:38:22
P12
I think I would click on the appointment, and then I would click on help.



311
0:38:31

Emily
okay.



312
0:38:32
P12
And then I would look at which one I if you can't pay future if you disagree with commate.



313
0:38:51

P12
Yeah, I think this is good information to have.



314
0:38:57
P12
Should it be a help at the top? I'm not really sure it should be



315
0:39:06

P12
What if somebody doesn't know that that's a option to click. I think it should be stated at the bottom. Like a link at the bottom. $20



316
0:39:18
P12
especially if somebody's not tech savvy, and doesn't know much about how to work apps. I feel like if there was a link at the bottom that took you to this page, or took you to something around this.



317
0:39:32

P12
where they can actually see the options. I think that would be more helpful to have at the bottom versus at the help button at the top, right.



318
0:39:39
Emily
Okay, so more more clear somewhere else. Okay, got it makes sense.



319
0:39:45

Emily
And then so let me have you walk through any, any other information that you would find useful here for this particular bill.



320
0:40:05
P12
I mean other than having the information like for pay your $50 bill to have it at the bottom of July 30, th like the the school that was at the bottom. They had the information rather than having the help button.



321
0:40:20

Emily
Oh, got it? Yeah, okay.



322
0:40:24
P12
I think that's more visible for people to see instead of trying to search for it.



323
0:40:30

P12
So I think that's another thing that



324
0:40:33
P12
would be useful if I said, Oh, wait! What do I do here? Okay, let me. Okay. How do I request financial help.



325
0:40:41

Emily
Okay, so is it right there? It's not clear how to request financial help.



326
0:40:46
Emily
Got it. Okay? Makes sense.



327
0:40:49

Emily
Okay? And let me have you. We're gonna walk me through what you do. If you are ready to pay this



328
0:40:57
Emily
again, not going to have you enter any real information.



329
0:41:01

P12
I'll click on pay and then pick either of these options. Is there a specific option you'd like me to pick for this.



330
0:41:10
Emily
Yeah, if you if you want to pay online



331
0:41:19

Emily
and I'll have you just scroll down. We're gonna not. Gonna have you read anything here. Go to continue to the form.
