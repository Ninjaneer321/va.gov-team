# Debt Services Initiative Product Brief

## Executive Summary

We will be combining the Financial Management Experience API, currently being migrated to a new API by the Lighthouse team, with the BlueSky design vision as championed by OCTO UX PO after that has been rolled out and implemented by VFS teams. 

## Background and Rationale

Jeff Barnes explained the direction that this work will take, in a meeting that was held on 11/21/2024. Jeff talked to Denise Coveyduck, who is the Product Owner for Debt Resolutions and has been developing Financial Management Experience products. The goal is to combine the Financial Management Experience products, which is currently being migrated to a new API by the Lighthouse team, with the BlueSky vision design from Ryan Thurlwell. An anticipated completion date for the API functionality is April 2025\. The BlueSky vision will be presented on 12/13/2024, and more information will be available after that meeting.

Because the current experience doesn’t show the entire transaction and the data that will be used in the API is known, the MFS team can begin to work with OCTO UX lead Ryan Thurlwell to establish the design, with his BlueSky visions. 

This product can start to work through the Collaboration Cycle with the Governance team, as the UX work is determined, and be combined with the Debt Services API when it is complete, then move to engineering and development. This API will combine the two separate debt streams from VA: The VHA debt and the VDA debt.
