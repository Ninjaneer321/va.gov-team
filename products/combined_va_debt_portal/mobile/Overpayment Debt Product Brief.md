# Overpayment Debt Product Brief

## Overview

Veterans can experience debt from the Veterans Affairs. The two types of debt that the Financial Management Team has focused on include: 

* Overpayments   
* Copayments (also referred to as copays)

Benefit overpayment debt can occur when a Veteran receives more compensation than they are entitled to, and it is handled by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). Examples of overpayments include a dependent change from a divorce, or even when a Veteran receives education benefits for a class but then drops the class and does not report that. In these instances, the Veteran will owe money to the VA for such actions. 

Veterans can view their overpayment debt through the authenticated experience on VA.gov. After logging on, they can access their debt portal through the My VA tab. If overpayment debt exists, Veterans can take the following actions: 

* View the debt  
* Make a payment and resolve the debt online  
* Dispute charges   
* Request assistance from the VA for financial hardship (by completing the Financial Status Report, VA Form 5655\)  
* View resources about VA debt management

## Problem Statement

The mobile app does not have any debt-related information for Veterans to access. How might we provide Veterans with the ability to view the total amount owed for benefit overpayment debt and the details related to that debt on the mobile app?  

## Bets to be Informed by Research

* Veterans will want an overview of their benefit overpayment debts on the mobile app.  
* Veterans will want to see details about their benefit overpayment debt on the mobile app to understand how much they owe for that debt.  
* Veterans might not understand overpayment debts and will want information on VA Debt Management resources and support.  
* Veterans will want information on steps to dispute a charge or request financial assistance, as well as be able to make a payment on their overpayment debt.

## Desired Outcomes

* Veterans will want to view their benefit overpayment debt on the mobile app to understand how much money they owe to the VA.   
* Veterans will want to view details related to the benefit overpayment debt on the mobile app so they understand why that debt exists.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* Total number of views of benefit overpayments. We expect this to be a non-zero amount and will increase once overpayments are viewable in the app. We will track the total number of views on a monthly basis.    
* Overall app volume. We expect to see an increase in overall app volume as benefit overpayment debt information is implemented within the app. We will track the overall app volume on a monthly basis.  
* Total number of clicks on the link to access VA.gov. We expect that Veterans will want to make a payment towards their benefit overpayments debt and that this non-zero amount will increase. We will track the total number of clicks on the link to access VA.gov on a monthly basis. 

### Supporting OCTO OKRs:

O1: VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.

## Assumptions

* We assume all the background, research, and direction the Financial Management team provided is accurate.   
* We assume that Veterans want a similar web and mobile user experience when accessing their debt.  
* We assume that Veterans will continue to want to view overpayments and copayments debt separately.

## Important Notes/Decisions/Background

* The MFS team will work closely with the Financial Management Team on this initiative.  
* A separate product brief exists for adding medical copayment debt to the mobile app.   
* The resources and support page on VA Debt can be found [here](https://www.va.gov/resources/va-debt-management/).   
* From user research conducted by the Financial Management Team, they reported a key finding that “everyone was excited about the potential of a mobile app and the ability to manage their VA bills and debt in the mobile app”.    
* On VA.gov, overpayment and copayment debt information are separated on the debt portal.  
* For Veterans to pay their overpayments online, a new tab will open from VA.gov, taking them to [pay.va.gov](https://www.pay.va.gov/).  
* The Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655\) is a form to request debt resolution, debt compromise, or monthly debt payments.    
* Resources and support page on VA Debt can be found [here](https://www.va.gov/resources/va-debt-management/).   
* [Here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/benefits-memorials-2/staging-users-debtproducts.md) is the Debt Resolution Staging Users by Product, with \+81 being a good [test user](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/mvi-staging-users.csv). 

## Solution Approach

* The MVP to provide Veterans with the ability to make a debt payment, request help with their debt, or dispute a debt will include linking them to their Debt Portal on VA.gov. In future iterations, we plan to allow Veterans to take these actions within app, so Veterans have a seamless user experience. As of April 2025, this is dependent on the Financial Management Team.
