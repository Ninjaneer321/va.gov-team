## Background üèóÔ∏è
The current VA mobile app includes the section "Payments", which shows the money VA has paid to the Veteran for compensation and pension benefits. As we expand this section to include money that the Veteran owes to VA‚Äîsuch as overpayment debts and medical copays‚Äîwe need to ensure that the section‚Äôs name accurately reflects this broader scope.

- `Putting Down Roots (Moment: Maintaining my financial, social, and emotional health)`
- `Retiring (Moment: Taking care of my health)`
- `Aging (Moment that Matters: Managing my declining health)`

## Research Goals ü•Ö	

### Goals and Questions

Explore how other organizations label sections dedicated to financial matters
- What terms do other apps + websites use to label sections where users manage debt, bills, or payments to them?
  
### Outcome

Insights from this analysis will be used to generate naming options for future studies (e.g. card sort, concept test, usability test). Future studies will be planned after this one is complete.

<!--
### Hypotheses
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to constrain the hypotheses to the goals of your study!
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don‚Äôt skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è

**Comparative Analysis**

We will look at apps and websites of other organizations where users manage financial matters (debts, bills, and payments). Each one will be reviewed for how they label sections related to:
- Money the user owes (e.g. copays, debts, balances)
- Money the organization owes the user (e.g. refunds, credits, reimbursements)

We will review 10-15 organizations in a variety of sectors, such as government, healthcare, finance, and utilities.

For each product, we will document:
- Exact labels for financial sections
- Where and how those labels appear in the navigation
- Scope of services under each label
- Any explanatory text for each label
