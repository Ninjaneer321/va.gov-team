## Research Goals 🥅	

### Goals

`1.` **Understand how users become aware of and locate information about money they owe.**

`2.` **Assess how well users understand and interpret their copay and overpayment information.**

`3.` **Identify what actions users want to take regarding money owed and evaluate how easily they can find guidance.** 

`4.` **Evaluate the experience of completing actions outside the app.**

### Outcome

- Determine optimal methods and timing for notifications about new debts to guide future design decisions
- Determine if native app products should be built (or path to external sites will remain) for:
  - paying copays + overpayment debts
  - requesting financial help
  - disputing debts
- Address and identify accessibility gaps
- Validate designs for viewing copays + overpayment debts



### Research questions


**Understand how users become aware of and locate information about money they owe.**

`1.` What prompts users to check on or take action regarding money they owe to the VA?  
`2.` How do users expect to be notified or informed about new debts (e.g., copays, overpayments)?  
`3.` Can users successfully locate the section of the app with information about money owed?  

**Assess how well users understand and interpret their copay and overpayment information.**

`4.` Is the overview of money owed (copays and overpayments) clear, complete, and useful?  
`5.` Can users access and make sense of detailed information for each item?  
`6.` Do users feel confident they understand what they owe and why?  
`7.` Do users find access to downloadable PDF copay statements helpful, and would they use this feature?  

**Identify what actions users want to take regarding money owed and evaluate how easily they can find guidance.** 

`8.` What types of actions (e.g., pay, request financial help, dispute a charge) do users expect to take in the app?  
`9.` How do users expect to complete each of these actions?  
`10.` Can users find clear, actionable guidance on how to proceed with each option?  

**Evaluate the experience of completing actions outside the app.**

`11.` How do users feel about being redirected to VA.gov to complete actions like requesting help or disputing a debt?  
`12.` Are users comfortable signing in to a new site and copying/pasting information from the app to complete a payment?
