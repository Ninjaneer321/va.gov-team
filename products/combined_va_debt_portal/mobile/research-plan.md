	# Research Plan for Mobile Feature Support, Debt Portal: Overpayments and Copayments, May 2025


 ## Background üèóÔ∏è
<details>
<br>
	
`Summary of study`
<br>

 Veterans can experience debt from the VA. The two types of debt that the Financial Management Team has focused on include: 

* Overpayments   
* Copayments (also referred to as copays)

Benefit overpayment debt can occur when a Veteran receives more compensation than they are entitled to, and it is handled by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). Examples of overpayments include a dependent change from a divorce, or even when a Veteran receives education benefits for a class but then drops the class and does not report that. In these instances, the Veteran will owe money to the VA for such actions. 

Copayments are part of an individual's health insurance and are the amount of money owed for a specific healthcare service or prescription; the remainder of the cost is covered by insurance. Veterans with medical copayment debt from the VA have received care at a VA health facility. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) manages medical copayments.  

Veterans can view their overpayment and copayment debts through the authenticated experience on VA.gov. After logging on, they can access their debt portal through the My VA tab. If overpayment or copayment debt exists, Veterans can take the following actions: 

* View the debt  
* Make a payment and resolve the debt online  
* Dispute charges   
* Request assistance from the VA for financial hardship (by completing the Financial Status Report, VA Form 5655\)  
* View resources about VA debt management

`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

The mobile app does not have any debt-related information for Veterans to access. How might we provide Veterans with the ability to view the total amount owed for benefit overpayment and medical copayment debts, as well as the details related to that debt on the mobile app?  

  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

Authenticated section of VA Mobile App, to be added to the existing "Payments" tab.
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

Veterans currently manage their debt and copayments on VA.gov; this will be a new addition to the mobile app.

## Research Goals ü•Ö	

### Goals

`1.` **Understand how users become aware of and locate information about money they owe.**

`2.` **Assess how well users understand and interpret their copay and overpayment information.**

`3.` **Identify what actions users want to take regarding money owed and evaluate how easily they can find guidance.** 

`4.` **Evaluate the experience of completing actions outside the app.**

### Outcomes

- Determine optimal methods and timing for notifications about new debts to guide future design decisions
- Determine if native app products should be built (or path to external sites will remain) for:
  - paying copays + overpayment debts
  - requesting financial help
  - disputing debts
- Address and identify accessibility gaps (note: Due to prototype limitations, we likely will not identify all accessibility issues)
- Validate designs for viewing copays + overpayment debts



### Research questions


**Understand how users become aware of and locate information about money they owe.**

`1.` What prompts users to check on or take action regarding money they owe to the VA?  
`2.` How do users expect to be notified or informed about new debts (e.g., copays, overpayments)?  
`3.` Can users successfully locate the section of the app with information about money owed?  
`4.` What term most clearly identifies the section they would go to manage money owed?

**Assess how well users understand and interpret their copay and overpayment information.**

`5.` Is the overview of money owed (copays and overpayments) clear, complete, and useful?  
`6.` Can users access and make sense of detailed information for each item?  
`7.` Do users feel confident they understand what they owe and why?  
`8.` Do users find access to downloadable PDF copay statements helpful, and would they use this feature?  

**Identify what actions users want to take regarding money owed and evaluate how easily they can find guidance.** 

`9.` What types of actions (e.g., pay, request financial help, dispute a charge) do users expect to take in the app?  
`10.` How do users expect to complete each of these actions?  
`11.` Can users find clear, actionable guidance on how to proceed with each option?  

**Evaluate the experience of completing actions outside the app.**

`12.` How do users feel about being redirected to VA.gov to complete actions like requesting help or disputing a debt?  
`13.` Are users comfortable signing in to a new site and copying/pasting information from the app to complete a payment?  

### Hypotheses

- Veterans will want notifications from the app when payments are due.
- Veterans will appreciate the overview of money owed from overpayment debts and copays.
- Veterans will find the details of each payment owed clear.
- Veterans will find navigation confusing when redirected out of the app to complete tasks.
- Veterans will be frustrated by having to log in to another site to make payments.
- PDF copay statements will not be useful.
- Veterans will find the help pages overwhelming with too much information.



## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è

Moderated usability testing using high-fidelity Figma prototypes over Zoom. The prototypes will simulate the mobile app's MVP debt portal where users can view details on their copays and overpayment debts.

Sessions will also include semi-structured interview questions. These questions will explore:

- Experiences and awareness of debt before accessing the app
- Actions taken outside of the app that will not be included in the MVP, such as payments, disputing charges, and requesting financial assistance. For the initial release, users will be linked to VA.gov for these actions

Note on Accessibility: Due to prototype limitations, this study will not include testing with users of assistive technologies. However, prototypes will be reviewed by accessibility specialists, who will identify any accessibility issues they can detect through expert evaluation.
