# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Exploratory and Concept Study, Roadmap and debt portal IA, February 2024

## Background

Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:

-   What problem is your product trying to solve?
    
-   Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
    
-   What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?
    

[Link to product brief](url goes here).

The first iteration of the debt portal had separate pages for overpayment debt and copayment statements. Veterans needed to visit the Debt Portal to see any benefit debts they had while they had to go to the Medical Copay Tool (a different place) to see any medical copays that they had acquired as a result of health care visits.

In 2021, a dashboard-like experience where Veterans are now able to see all of their VA debts, debt letters and copayment statements in one place was created. The overarching goal was to allow Veterans to view *all their VA debts online and decrease the time it takes to resolve those debts while meeting congressional mandates.

This solution has been designed to empower the Veteran to see all their debt and copayment statements. We envision it will also grow to include future options that can help the Veteran to manage those debts such as requesting a waiver, submitting a dispute, offering a compromise, setting up a payment plan, and viewing payments made towards their debts. When Veterans make a submission, that information is routed to VBA and/or VHA.

Research was conducted on Debt Letters (overpayments) ([link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/debt-letters-mvp/research)) in 2020, Medical copays ([link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research)) in 2021, Combined Debt Portal ([link](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/research)) in 2022. We seek to perform additional foundational, exploratory research that can inform the long term vision of the debt portal and the roadmap. We will also share the debt portal summary page in the second part of the interviews in order to understand whether overpayments and copays should continue to have their own summary pages.

  

### OCTO Priorities

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

-   Decrease Veteran confusion and time it takes to review, manage or resolve their Meeting congressional mandates
    
-   Optimize Veteran experience and align to Veteran feedback
    
-   Allow DMC, VHA and others to promote a singular experience to Veterans to ease in communications and access to portal financial matters
    

### Veteran Journey

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

Debt can happen at any stage in [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.

Other key moments this research touches key moments in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
    

## Research Goals

What are you trying to learn from this research?

Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

**Goal 1, Exploratory and foundational:**

To understand the desirability of a holistic debt portal experience and what Veterans would like to see in one. We will present reaction/idea cards on slides with a word on them for Veterans to give feedback on.

Reaction card terms/ideas:

-   Financial hub
    
-   My VA benefits overview
    
-   Financial resources
    
-   Explain financial terms
    
-   Frequently asked questions
    
-   Personalization
    
-   One stop shop
    
-   Manage my VA debt benefits overpayments
    
-   Manage my copay bills
    
-   Benefits payment
    
-   Travel pay
    
-   Separation pay
    
-   Statement
    
-   Update dependents
    
-   Mobile app
    

Example:

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/nI_ALr5m6I4LlpSQySbn8qRtjzuHIkqPyLo8tGKRKFq7mZ5STmySspERVpbiGKq8n-npEfyYOPgknKS77WNBV4mbDUa7I74xGg9BrFsjhXSuutWkehkCaFjez72CHycANskXcV4O3LB9Qp5lrGlQezo)

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/dKWC2rcEZJFZ-AgMrc7kfO51-hReHMaj2-B24k-ggOOpVTO_f7CYlp3-ssaGrzag0pYZ-qJKGfUStxocc9ma8JytehAwCUtrcaDhLwz43IdzIFUAqGLZrgPRdes3xhaYV0N49-05caVsBIER4lFeZL0)

  

**Goal 2, Conceptual and generative:**

To understand if the combined nature of the debt portal with copayment statements, overpayment debt, and the possibility of other types of debt in one place is desirable and easy to understand, versus separating these into their own pages. The information we learn from this part of the interviews will allow us to simplify the existing debt portal.

Original Concept for Debt Portal Copay + Debt Landing page:

-   This will allow Veterans to see an overview of all the money they owe VA 
in one place, which meets Congressional mandates + our users’ expectations
    
-   How the VHA copays and VBA debt data varies won’t be as evident if Veterans drill down into those separate debt types
    
-   Having an overview page instead of showing all detailed debt cards in one view
can reduce cognitive load. It could be overwhelming to see a long list of items, especially when it comes to something as sensitive as debts

**Option 1  
Copay Email > Debt Portal Unauth page > Debt Portal Summary page > Debt Portal Copay Summary page**

### Research questions

Part 1: Exploratory and Foundational

1.  What are Veterans thoughts and preferences about a holistic debt portal vs a simplified one? We will share reaction cards with words/concepts on them (i.e.: “financial resources”, “one stop shop”, etc.) to convey holistic debt portal ideas versus more simple ones to get Veterans thoughts.
    
2.  Where do Veterans in different types of financial situations land with a holistic experience vs a simplified one?

Part 2: Conceptual and Generative

3.  How easy to understand is the combined debt portal? How do Veterans feel about seeing all of their debts in one place?
**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/NGunINFJVWAamWTa7bRaZ9qfyODv7lF6qhPi1W49lmmSNF_akCgX6srJPq_KBfVztG0Leq6kCu0UhRIyl2zJGxKYVlJDI7_l_pzlPPcDC-Gzs-Aea_LVRc0F7JTyWTY2jKl4BH14suRatanc9u8inv4)**
4.  What would help Veterans easily digest the information on the debt portal?
### Hypothesis

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

-   What do you already know about this problem space?
    
-   What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
    
-   Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.
    
-   Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!
    

  

-   We hypothesize that Veterans in more difficult financial situations (i.e. experiencing greater financial strain) will want more resources in the debt portal, hence they will lean more towards a holistic debt portal experience.
    
-   Based on previous research in 2022, hypothesis 2: ‘Participants will expect to find their copay bills and benefit debts in one location’ was likely true. We expect that the combined nature of the debt portal will be consistent with the idea of a “one stop shop” echoed by participants across various studies, and that the different types of debt being combined will be easy to understand and desirable.
    

## Methodology

Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.

Examples of common research methods include:

-   Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
    
-   Concept study
    
-   [Reaction cards](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1G7MVZX-w3jyhobl80WlBTUdWMhKVvtKbqX2NqV0uQZQ/edit#slide=id.p) for exploratory research
      

### Location

Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research. [Learn more about setting up in-person research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/planning-in-person-research.md)

Moderated and on Zoom.

## Recruitment

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources.

-   [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research.
    
-   [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities
    

### Recruitment approach

Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?

Pro tip:

-   For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants.
    
-   Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups.
    
-   Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)
    

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

Recruitment strategy: Extreme case sampling and inclusive sampling: recruit a diverse sample.

Population sought: Veterans that are most likely to use the debt portal in its current or future state.

## Timeline

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

### Prepare

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

-   Pilot participant email: [ TBD ]
    
-   Date and time of pilot session: [ TBD ]
    
### Research sessions

**-   Planned dates of research: 2/21 - 2/28**
**-   Study can begin Wednesday 2/21**

### Length of sessions

-   Session length: 60 minutes
    
-   Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
    
-   Maximum Sessions per day: 3
    

### Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.

Please request enough dates and at least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; 12 time slots for 6 participants). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
