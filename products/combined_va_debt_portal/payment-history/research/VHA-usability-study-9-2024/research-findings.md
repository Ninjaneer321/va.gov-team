## Research Goals

This usability and comprehension study built on knowledge and findings from research in the July 2024 VBA payment history study. These two parallel debt portal paths (VBA and VHA) should be consistent in their information architecture for the use case of Veterans who will utilize both. The information contained within them differs in so far as the type of debt/bills and ways of resolving.

Veterans that have VBA debt and Veterans that have VA medical debt have different mental models and needs. Understanding the mental models of Veterans that have isolated or recurring health needs and are required to pay VHA copays was a focus of this study.

Moreover, we were able to confirm that some Veterans with higher reliance on VA health services were a part of more vulnerable groups (Veterans that have complex medical needs or multiple chronic health conditions, and mental health conditions, which might affect their experiences with usability and comprehension).

  We see pain points that surfaced in Medallia feedback and usability studies:

-   As of May 2024, Veterans do not receive timely confirmation of payments made on the debt portal, resulting in confusion, frustration, and possibly mistrust.
    
-   Veterans may not see their payment confirmation reflected in the debt portal for months.
    
-  They can’t revisit the debt portal to review this payment history
    
-   They have to wait for the next statement a month later to see their payment
    
-   Inconsistent messaging about payments made can be a distressing experience for Veterans seeking to resolve and address their debt.
    
-   Details about VHA medical copays are in the copay statement page which is often difficult to find.
    

The goals of this study were:

### 1.  To understand usability (findability and navigation) and comprehension of the revised information architecture of the copay path of the debt portal.
   
- Copay summary page,

- Copay detail page along with payment history,

- Resolution page
  

### 2.  To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.
  
  - How clear is the transaction information on the Copay Details page?

- Are Veterans interested in seeing pending transactions? Why or why not?

-   How do Veterans perceive pending transactions? Does it fit within their mental models, or does it cause confusion?
    

Did participants understand:

-   When their bill is due?
    
-   How much is currently due?
    
-   Copay statuses and icons
    

  

### 3.  To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models.
    

- What information is necessary on doctor visit summaries, and prescription medication summaries?

- Do Veterans have concerns about the security and privacy of their PHI?

- What are Veterans' mental models about VHA copay billing?


## Research questions

#### Goal 1: To understand usability (findability and navigation) and comprehension of the revised information architecture of the copay path of the debt portal.

  
1.  How understandable are the overpayment summary page and detail page? How is the comprehension of the different financial elements on these pages?
    
2.  Do participants notice and understand the icon callouts on the debt overview page (exclamation point, checkmark)?
    
3.  What elements on the page draw their attention?
    
4.  What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable they might be missing?
    
5.  Can participants define and/or understand the different transaction fields
    
	
	-   current amount
	    
	-   original amount
	    
	-   total paid
	    
	-   date of last payment
	    
	-   next payment due
	    
	-   total late fees/interests?
    

6.  Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are?
    
	-   "Resolve"
	    
	-   "Pay your balance, request help or dispute this overpayment"
    

7.  What is the findability of different elements like on these pages?
    
8.  Can participants find what they are looking for or what they deem to be important on this page?

10. What is missing in this experience, if anything?

### Goal 1: To understand usability (findability and navigation) and comprehension of the revised information architecture of the copay path of the debt portal.

1.  How understandable are the copay summary page, detail page, and resolve page?
    
2.  Can participants find what they are looking for?
    
3.  Can participants point out/indicate where on the page the CTAs/important actions are? (pay, request help, dispute the debt)
    
4.  What elements on the page draw their attention? What doesn’t stand out/ is less noticeable?
    
5.  Do Veterans understand the callouts that indicate the copay bill has progressed with more serious consequences (treasury, debt collections)?
    

### Goal 2: To understand comprehension of transaction detail additions.

6.  Do participants understand:
    

-   When their bill is due?
    
-   How much is currently due?
    
-   Copay statuses and icons
    

7.  How clear is the transaction information on the Copay Details page?
    
	-   Can participants define and/or understand the different transaction fields (new charges, previous balance, payments received, date of last payment, next payment due, total late fees/interests)?
    
8.  Are Veterans interested in seeing pending transactions?
    
	-   How do Veterans perceive pending transactions? Does it fit within their mental models, or does it cause confusion?
    

### Goal 3: To understand comprehension of the medical copay detail additions that we are surfacing sooner. To understand whether the information is helpful to Veterans and how it aligns with their mental models. Additionally, understand Veterans' mental models about VA copay billing in general.

9.  What information is necessary on doctor visit summaries, and prescription medication summaries?
    
	-   Do Veterans have concerns about the security and privacy of their PHI?
    
	-   What are Veterans' mental models about VHA copay billing?
    
10.  What are Veterans perceptions of VA copay billing and VBA overpayment debt being housed under one experience?
    
		- Does it trigger negative feelings? (associating receiving medical copay bills as "debt")
    
		- Do they seem unrelated to Veterans?
    
		-   What is a better conceptual model for this hub?

##  Methodology

-   Usability and comprehension testing - appropriate for evaluative research

## Hypotheses

Hypothesis 1: 

The revised debt portal IA (with the addition of a copay detail page and surfacing of statement data sooner) will be easy to understand. Veterans will be able to easily navigate between pages, review their statements, and resolve their copay bills. 

**Likely true**

Hypothesis 2:  

VHA payment history (including activity since the last statement and current statement data) displayed on the copay detail page will be easy to understand.  Medical visit copay and prescription copay details will also be easy to understand and be helpful to see. 

-   Payment history was easy to comprehend in the VBA payment history study. Hence, we expect that payment history (current balance amount, previous balance, new charges, payments received, total feels/interest, payment due date) will be easy to understand for the Veteran in the VHA study as well. 
- We further hypothesize that details provided for medical visit copays and prescription copays will be easy to understand and provide the right amount of detail. 
    
 **Likely true**
    
Some participants may express concern about their PHI.
 
 **Maybe true**
 
Hypothesis 3: 

The addition of pending copay charges will be beneficial to Veterans. 

-  A year’s worth of Medallia data reveals that Veterans want to see current balances to make informed budgeting decisions. We expect that participants will find it helpful to view pending charges. Participants will understand that these transactions are pending and have not been finalized.
    
-   Participants will differentiate the current statement section from the activity since the last statement (pending) section.

**Likely false**

Hypothesis 4: 

#### Veterans will be able to differentiate between copay bills that are payable, receiving a benefit offset, and sent to the Department of Treasury. 

-   The VBA payment history study revealed that participants were able to deduce that some VA debts are payable on the debt portal, while others are not (benefits offsets and Department of Treasury). We believe this information will be clear to participants for the VHA copay path as well. 

**Definitely true**    

## Methodology

 Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design.

-   Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
    
## Key Findings

### 1. Navigation & Findability

 Navigation and findability were excellent: Veterans in this study could easily find information they were looking for and knew which links to click on to read more details on their bill and to resolve the bill. Additionally, comprehension was excellent, overall.
 
Not all participants were asked about this but of those who were, the majority of those participants were in favor of the way content was divided among these pages.

  

### 2.  Copay Overview page  
Veterans we interviewed correctly interpreted the status differences between each facility's copay bill (payable in the portal, not payable since escalated to treasury, and already paid).
    

### 3.  Copay Detail page
    
The copay detail page was overall well understood but could be 	improved.

**Pending Transactions**

Overall, seeing pending transactions unrelated to the bill that is owed was described as unhelpful at best and confusing at worst by 5 of 8 participants (2 of 10 participants did not see this section).

**Copay Detail Descriptions**

**Prescription copay**
	
The feedback we received on the prescription copay details was very positive. All of the information provided in the example was described as helpful.

**Outpatient care copay**

Keeping this section simple seems preferable based on participant 	feedback.

  The majority of participants said the information was helpful:

-   Department or clinic name
    
-   Name of diagnosis* (some concerns about PHI, 3 of 8 participants)
    
-   Doctor’s name
    
**Inpatient care copay**

A more in depth study that includes more participants who had inpatient stays would be helpful in determining this information.

 **Alert Component**

The information in the alert component was easy to understand. Participants could easily find the due date and current balance.  

**Copay Detail Section**

The copay details section after the yellow alert component and before the statement caused confusion because it referenced activity outside of the current month.

**Rights and responsibilities** 

The Rights and responsibilities modal link is currently on the combined Copay Detail and Resolve Page. On the prototype it is only placed on the Copay Details page. It is worth exploring the placement in future studies.

### 4.  Resolve page
    
Participants easily understood each section: Pay online, Pay by phone, pay by mail, pay in person, request financial help, dispute this bill.

### 5.  Service Design
    
Participants were able to easily find and understand the Resolve page and all of the options available to them. Three participants who had not used the debt portal before were not aware of all of the ways they could resolve their bill, including requesting financial help. There is room for improvement on raising awareness to Veterans who receive copays and do not access the debt portal that financial help is available to them.
