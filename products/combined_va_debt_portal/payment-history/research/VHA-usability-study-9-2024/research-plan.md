# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, VHA Debt Portal payment history, September - October 2024
## Evaluative usability study (60 minutes)

## Background


[Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/payment-history/initiative-brief.md) 

This usability and comprehension study builds on knowledge and findings from research in the July 2024 VBA payment history study. These two parallel debt portal paths (VBA, VHA) should be consistent in their information architecture (1 thing per page) for the use case of Veterans who may utilize both. The information contained within them differs in so far as the types of debt and the way they can be resolved. 

Veterans that have VA medical debt will have unique mental models and needs. Understanding the mental models of Veterans that have isolated or recurring health needs and are required to pay VHA copays will be important. Moreover, we can assume that some Veterans with higher reliance on VA health services may be part of more vulnerable groups (Veterans that have complex medical needs or multiple chronic health conditions, which might affect their experiences with usability and comprehension). Although, we are not certain whether these Veterans will be paying copays (this is still an open question we have). We expect that by talking with Veterans in the situation of paying VHA copays, we will be able to have a better understanding of their situations, their mental models, and their needs.

We do, however, expect that similarly to the findings in the VBA payment history study, usability and comprehension should test well.

In terms of the background of this initiative, we see similar pain points and difficulties for both Veterans that have VBA debt and Veterans that have VHA bills:


-   As of May 2024, Veterans do not receive timely confirmation of payments made on the debt portal, resulting in confusion, frustration, and possibly mistrust.
    
-   Veterans may not see their payment confirmation reflected in the debt portal for months.
    
-   They receive an immediate confirmation when the payment is made *
    
-   They canâ€™t revisit the debt portal to review this payment history
    
-   They have to wait for the next statement a month later to see their payment
    
-   Inconsistent messaging about payments made can be a distressing experience for Veterans seeking to resolve and address their debt.
    

## Why

-   The payment history data messaging discrepancy is due to the payment history being batched on a monthly basis, resulting in untimely information on the debt portal.
    
-   Veterans rely on consistent messaging across the different channels of official communication with VA (email, debt portal, call center) to have confidence that their payments went through. Inconsistencies can reinforce mistrust of VA.
    

## How

Payment history improvements support the following:

-   All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.
    
-   Veterans share more positive feedback on Medallia.
