# Past Research Analysis for New Research Plan Prompt

This prompt is designed to assist researchers in leveraging existing knowledge within the repository to inform and enhance new research plans. By conducting an analysis of past research, users can ensure that their planned research builds on previous findings and avoids redundancy.

## Purpose

The purpose of this prompt is to:
- Identify and link to past relevant research conducted within the repository.
- Highlight key findings from previous studies that are applicable to the new research plan.
- Provide a foundation of insights to inform the direction, scope, and methodology of future research efforts.

## Instructions for Use

1. Draft and commit your research plan
2. Open Github Copilot for your research plan (***TIP: Hit the Copilot icon twice to attach it to the chat.***)
3. Copy the prompt below and paste into your research plan Copilot chat
4. Use the insights gathered to inform your research questions, methodology, and expected outcomes.
5. Highlight gaps in knowledge or opportunities for further exploration.

## Best Practices

- **Be Thorough:** Ensure you review a comprehensive range of past research to avoid missing critical insights.
- **Focus on Relevance:** Prioritize studies and findings that closely align with your new research objectives.
- **Document Clearly:** Provide clear, concise summaries and well-organized links to enhance usability for other team members.


By following these steps, you can ensure that your new research plan is grounded in existing knowledge and aligned with organizational goals.
