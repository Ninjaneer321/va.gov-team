### Copilot Prompt for Research Plan Analysis

#### **1. Background Analysis**
* "Summarize the problem this product is trying to solve. Highlight any assumptions or gaps that might need further exploration."
* "Identify where the product is situated on VA.gov and discuss why this placement is suitable or not."
* "Evaluate the familiarity of Veterans with this tool. Are there potential challenges in adoption based on its novelty or iteration?"
* "Review the linked product brief and summarize the key takeaways for this research."

#### **2. OCTO-DE Priorities Alignment**
* "Analyze how this research aligns with the specified OCTO priorities. Are there any areas of misalignment or missed opportunities?"
* "Evaluate the relevance of each key result to the research goals. Suggest ways to strengthen alignment if needed."

#### **3. Veteran Journey Context**
* "Identify the Veteran journey phases relevant to this product. Discuss why these phases are critical and how they influence the research approach."
* "Highlight any gaps in understanding of these journey phases and suggest follow-up questions to explore them further."

#### **4. Research Goals and Outcomes**
* "Assess the clarity and focus of the stated research goals. Are they specific, measurable, and achievable?"
* "Evaluate the proposed outcome: How will the research advance the product? Are there additional outcomes that should be considered?"

#### **5. Research Questions**
* "Examine the research questions and their alignment with the stated goals. Are they actionable and likely to yield meaningful insights?"
* "Suggest additional or alternative questions to address potential gaps in the study."

#### **6. Hypotheses**
* "Analyze the hypotheses for clarity and relevance to the study goals. Are they grounded in prior knowledge and assumptions?"
* "Identify any biases that might be inherent in the hypotheses and suggest ways to mitigate them."

#### **7. Methodology**
* "Evaluate the appropriateness of the chosen methodology for the research goals and design maturity."
