# Research Plan for AEDP Prefill Study, July 24, 2024
### Q4 2024
## Background
A variety of digital products within the authenticated VA.gov experience provide a service to users that prefill some of their existing profile information in order to save them time and energy. Our team is tasked with reviewing current or potential VADS design patterns to improve guidance around their implementation for consistency and ease of use across the different use cases on VA.gov. We have researched how this pattern has been used so far across the site, and would like to test some of the different variations we have seen implemented to find the best possible solution for the widest audience.

Some of the variations we plan to test include:
- Location of the prefill alert (Intro page vs Form pages)
- Display style of both locked and editable data sets (Address vs Gray Box)
- Location where updated data is saved (Profile vs Form)

Many forms prefill personal information on VA.gov right now. By determining the best placement, style and experience of using this pattern, we will provide improved guidance for this pattern that will help to improve the user experience of VA.gov as well as other federal government digital products.

### OCTO Objectives and Veteran Journey

This work supports the [OCTO Objective 3.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md) Our people are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make a sustained impact. Because this design pattern can be used across a wide variety of forms and digital products, the study fits into the [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/5fa2c0a1630337422de4e8f719cdcac3e391fe1a/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf#L2) throughout the full life cycle of the Veteran.

## Research Goals	
Goals for this research include:
- Understand how and when users need the prefill alert to appear.
- Understand how users expect the prefilled data to display.
- Understand users' expectations around why certain data can be edited within their profile and other data cannot.
- Understand how users expect the edit process to work, where they expect their edits to get saved, and if they want to be asked where to save their data.
 

### Outcome
We will synthesize the data from this study and create a summary report of our learnings. This research will inform decisions around these two patterns our team is refining:
[Help users to... Know when their information is prefilled](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/tmf-auth-exp-design-patterns/issues/17)
[Help users to... Update prefilled information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/tmf-auth-exp-design-patterns/issues/22)
This research will help us refine these patterns and to feel confident in our recommendations for these patterns when we submit them to VADS and USWDS.


### Research questions
We will guide participants to complete the tasks using a think-aloud method. We will start with broader questions, then ask more specific questions as needed to get the data we are seeking.

*Goal 1: Understanding how and when users expect the prefill alert to appear.*
- Does the prefill alert in the unauthenticated experience entice them to sign in to complete the form?
- Where do they expect the prefill alert message to be located once they are authenticated?
- In what variation do they notice the prefill alert? Top of page? On the step pages?
- Do they notice other alerts while the prefill alert is on the same page?
- Does bolding the word ‘note’ make an impact on whether they will read the information?

*Goal 2: Understanding how users expect the prefilled data to display.*
- Which version of the data display (address block vs gray card component) helps users to more quickly understand that it contains prefilled data?
- Do they notice the prefilled data where it is located on the page in either the address block or gray card component?

*Goal 3: Understand users' expectations around why certain data can be edited within their profile and other data cannot.*
- How do they feel about the ability to edit some data but not others?
- Is it clear how to edit data within the form? Is it clear how to edit data that is not editable within the form?
- Does the user understand why some data is not editable?
- Does having some data protected increase user trust in VA handling of PII?

*Goal 4: Understand how users expect the edit process to work and where they expect their edits to get saved.*
- What do they think happens when they save their information?
- Where do they think the new information gets saved? (profile vs form)
- Would they ever want to choose where this information gets saved? 
- Which type of prefilled data display do they prefer to see on the edit page? (in-field vs gray box)
- What kind of confirmation message do users expect after they have saved their data?

### Hypothesis
Location of the prefill alert (Intro page vs Form pages):
- The prefill alert on the front page will entice the user to login for a more convenient experience.
- Bolding “note” in the prefill alert messaging will help users see a block of text quicker.
- Users will more easily notice the intro prefill alert when it’s at the top of the page.
- The user will experience alert exhaustion because of how frequent alerts are displayed in the pilot and possibly the wider VA experience.
- We will learn that the under only needs the prefill alert on the intro page.

Display style of both locked and editable data sets (Address vs Gray Box):
- The users will prefer the address component over the gray box for the locked data.

Location where updated data is saved (Profile vs Form):
- Users understand why we limit in screen edits for some types of data and find the messaging around this reason to be sufficient.
- As long as the data is going back to their profile, they will not want to be asked if it is ok to update their profile.
- Users will prefer to see the gray box with their current data that they are editing on the same screen while they are editing.
- Users want to be informed if their data is not updating to their profile.
- The confirmation alert will help users understand when their profile has been updated.


## Method	
We will perform usability testing on three scenario-based concept tests - appropriate for evaluating structured design maturity. We will use the think-aloud format so that we can evaluate how the user is responding to the design as they perform a task we give them. We will show the three concepts to each participant and change the order of concepts shown to avoid the first view bias.

**Note:** This may change to two concepts per participant if we find that three are too many flows to show each participant.

### Location

We will hold the research sessions remotely on Zoom.

### Research materials

Conversation guide (to be added)
Prototype (to be added)
	
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We are looking for 12 Veterans to participate in this study. We’ll use a lean maximum strategy for inclusivity, targeting 3 demographic criteria (age, gender, race) as primary sample distribution criteria, and race/ethnicity as a secondary sample distribution criteria.

### Recruitment criteria
X Veterans (includes a 25% over recruit)

### Screener
*Primary Criteria*

Users who are able to navigate web spaces on their mobile device:

*“Are you able to login to your mobile phone to navigate websites and willing to conduct this test on your mobile device?”*

*"Are you willing to share over Zoom a web browser window on your device?"*

*"Do you have a working microphone on your device?"*

*"Can you have Zoom downloaded to your device prior to the session and know how to share your screen?"*

- At least x but no more than x Veterans who identify as a gender other than male. 
- At least x but no more than x Veterans over 65 years old.
- At least x Veterans under 35 years old.

*Secondary Criteria*

- At least x Veterans who are not White/Caucasian.
