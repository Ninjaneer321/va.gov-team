# Previous Research Synthesis - What we know about Update Prefill
## Authenticated Experience Design Patterns (AEDP) Team 9.10.2024

### Introduction

The AEDP team is tasked with tracking the best design patterns used throughout VA.gov, improving them for a wider audience, and recommending them to the USWDS for inclusion in their pattern library. Our process began with collecting all the potential patterns that could be considered and prioritizing them as a team based on both importance and feasibility (see [Pattern Prioritization mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1719935240619/2a4978c3cf5c7320fbf5c37f26fa0860d0798589?sender=u4cef3aa06e6e500fdad48741)). We emerged from that workshop by prioritizing [Help users to... Know when their information is Prefilled](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1314?pane=issue&itemId=71462355) (AKA Prefill) as our first pattern, knowinged that this should be followed up with [Help users toâ€¦ Update Prefilled Information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/tmf-auth-exp-design-patterns/issues/22) (AKA Update Prefill). This document details our understanding around the previous research we have done on this pattern and will later include content that describes our reasoning for creating the testing prototype that will be built out.

### Why Update Prefill?

Once our team decided on Prefill as our first pattern, it was easy to see that Update Prefill should be the next in line as the two are closely related. While Prefill describes the process of the system automatically providing you prefilled data in your authenticated forms along with an alert notifying you to their presence, the Update Prefill pattern covers the process of editing the prefilled information, letting the user know where the edit is happening, and confirming the change has been made. The current update process often takes on the List and Loop pattern, but there are also instances of an in-line edit process used in production that the Design System team generally wants to avoid. There are a variety of ways this is implemented throughout VA.gov currently, so there are many forms from us to choose from in order to create our next testing prototype.

### Variations Seen in Production
The ['Update prefilled information' in the Wild mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1722538218743/e8a34db6e16086f9122fd2e0927edf5607bfa273?sender=u4cef3aa06e6e500fdad48741) mural contains screenshots of a variety of forms that currently use this pattern. Those forms include:
- 526EZ - File for disability compensation
- 10-10EZ - Apply for VA healthcare
- 21P-527EZ - Apply for Veterans Pension benefits
- 26-1880 - Request a Certificate of Eligibility
- 10182 - Request a Board Appeal
- Order medical supplies form
  
### What is Prefill versus Update Prefill?

Our team has defined the following elements to be part of the Prefill pattern:
- Info Alert component

![Prefill Info Alert](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/authenticated-patterns/Design%20and%20Research/2024-09%20Research%20Initiative%202%20-%20Update%20Prefill/Images/Info%20Alert%20Component.png)

- Component to show prefilled data

  - Locked state

![Locked state](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/authenticated-patterns/Design%20and%20Research/2024-09%20Research%20Initiative%202%20-%20Update%20Prefill/Images/Locked%20State.png)

      - Guidance on how to change info that is uneditable on VA.gov

   - Editable state

      - Guidance on where the edit will save

These are the elements which we consider to be part of the Update Prefill pattern:
- Edit prefilled info page

![Edit prefilled info page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/authenticated-patterns/Design%20and%20Research/2024-09%20Research%20Initiative%202%20-%20Update%20Prefill/Images/Edit%20prefilled%20info.png)
- Format of providing old data to edit (See above)
- Confirmation message when edit is complete

![Confirmation message](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/authenticated-patterns/Design%20and%20Research/2024-09%20Research%20Initiative%202%20-%20Update%20Prefill/Images/Confirmation%20message.png)
- (potentially) Option to select where the edit saves

### Ongoing Slack Conversations on Update Prefill
Teams such as the Platform Design System, Forms, AskVA, Accredited Representative Management, and the Benefits team have all been engaged in recent conversations in Slack regarding this pattern. Many questions focus on the Phone Number component and how using different labels could mess up the Profile data. There are also questions about updating prefilled info in the middle of a form, and if a user needs to keep selecting 'Continue' in order for the edit to save to their profile. These conversations are tracked in the ['Update prefilled information' in the Wild mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1722538218743/e8a34db6e16086f9122fd2e0927edf5607bfa273?sender=u4cef3aa06e6e500fdad48741). 



To be added in future sprints...

### Creating our Testing Plan
Our current testing plan is laid out in the [Update prefilled information Discovery mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1722538963593/ec6a1e4d13493cc9fbb07898a31120cec2bf69c0?sender=u4cef3aa06e6e500fdad48741), but we will be updating it as the results from our Prefill research study are disseminated.
