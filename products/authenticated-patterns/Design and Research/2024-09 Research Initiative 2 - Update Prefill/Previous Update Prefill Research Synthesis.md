# Previous Research Synthesis - What we know about Prefill
## Authenticated Experience Design Patterns (AEDP) Team 8.12.2024

### Introduction

The AEDP team is tasked with taking the best design patterns used (both officially and unofficially) on VA.gov, improving them for a wider audience, and recommending them to the USWDS for inclusion in their pattern library. Our process began with collecting all the potential patterns that could be considered and prioritizing them as a team based on both importance and feasibility (see [Pattern Prioritization mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1719935240619/2a4978c3cf5c7320fbf5c37f26fa0860d0798589?sender=u4cef3aa06e6e500fdad48741)). We emerged from that workshop with Prefill as our first component and this document details out why we chose this and how we determined our testing prototype. 

### Why Prefill?

Our team determined early on that Prefill was a pattern we wanted to work on first for a variety of reasons. To start, it was already a component being used throughout the site in a variety of ways. It gave the engineering team a leg up to be able to more easily investigate how it’s being used and how to make that current code more efficient. Additionally, it was closely tied to another pattern ([Help users to… Update Prefilled Information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/tmf-auth-exp-design-patterns/issues/22)) that the team wanted to tackle next, and it scored high on both importance and feasibility, so we decided to select Prefill and began investigating its history at VA.gov.
