# Authenticated Experience Design Patterns Team Hand-off Document
### Last updated: 4-25-2025

The Authenticated Experience Design Patterns team works on research and design of experimental designs, in collaboration with the Design System Team. Engineering teams are then able to adopt the patterns into their applications and forms, either as-is, or when available, with allowed adjustments to the designs.

The information below is constructed to help a future team onboard and come up to speed quickly on work that needs to be accomplished.
