# Authenticated Experience Design Patterns Team Hand-off Document
### Last updated: 5-7-2025
The Authenticated Experience Design Patterns team develops and contributes design patterns to the [VA Design System](https://design.va.gov/) (VADS). Teams who develop products on VA.gov can use these patterns for their applications. Patterns are flexible for adoption. 

The information below is constructed to help a future team onboard and come up to speed quickly on work that needs to be accomplished.
