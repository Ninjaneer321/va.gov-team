Follow this pattern to help users know how and when their information will be prefilled for them in an application. 

## Usage

### When to use this pattern

- Prefilled Profile data is being displayed within a form or application. When pre-filling a form with data stored in the userâ€™s Profile, it is appropriate to explain which data we have stored for a user and make it clear if that data will be changed if edited in this form.

#### Design Principals
- Visibility of system status. This pattern demonstrates the [usability principle of communicating the current state](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/visibility-system-status/) in order to allow users to feel in control and to be able to take appropriate action.
- User control and freedom. This pattern also gives users control over their own information thereby providing control and freedom.

### When not to use this pattern

- For unauthenticated users. Users who are unauthenticated should not see this pattern as we cannot use their profile data to prefill the form.

### When to use caution

- When prefilling from a source other than VA Profile.
