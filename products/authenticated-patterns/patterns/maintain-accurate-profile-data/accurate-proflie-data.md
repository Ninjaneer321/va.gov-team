## Background

As a Veteran, I want to easily edit my profile, so I can keep my profile up to date.

There are several different 'profiles' users can edit across the various VA platforms and products. We aim to conduct research into these, document the gaps between them and propose a path to unification and consistency. For example, there exists an 'Emergency Contact' section within the profile on one platform, but this data is not stored in other VA profiles. 

During our research into the Prefill Form Data pattern, we discovered that users may find outdated profile data that has been prefilled and want to correct it, so as part of this pattern we will aim to provide an easy way to update that profile data when completing a prefilled form. 

## Hypothesis
This pattern will tie in closely with the prefill form pattern and knowing where and how to update out of date information when forms are prefilled. We believe that creating improved personal profile maintenance interfaces will:
- Improve and maintain data quality within user profiles
- Promote consistency in how profile data is updated across VA platforms
- Reduce cognitive load and friction when updating their profile data


## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - .  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - .
 
### What're you building

We believe this pattern may consist of:
- consistent presentation of profile fields across all VA products
- directions to update profile data
- page-level alerts
- inline alerts
