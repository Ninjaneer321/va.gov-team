## Agenda: Review outstanding questions/comments on Marital Status designs


### Action Items
- [Done] Kristen: reach out to content today
- [ ] Kristen: express to 1010ez that we think there is something on the page Marital status page around 'Why we ask for this'. We don't have the option(s) yet but we will shortly.
- [ ] Kristen: Ask the 1010ez to let us know if they get comments on placement of the 'deceased spouse' checkbox / language.
- [Done] Christine scheduled the meeting with Renata (1010EZ research) for Monday.
- [Done] Second set of eyes in Mural to see if all financial separate living situation questions are in Figma.
- [ ] Ticket in our sprint (Fran): update marital status pattern based on Renata's team's research


### Decisions
- Becky: Re the Living situation section, (form 686conly question) The value of leaving the question about "did yor spouse have an income in the last 365 days...) in Figma will provide a good example of having a one-off question and how that's handled. (Kristen: maybe there's a middle ground of showing teams how and where to add questions e.g. if you have to add additional household financial info, this is how you do it.
- Leave the questions (that are specific to certain forms) in Figma so others will know why they are there and that they can be removed/altered.
