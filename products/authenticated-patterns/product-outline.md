## Overview
Our team aims to create patterns for the authenticated experience that can be shared with USWDS and other federal agencies.

## Problem Statement
{{to do}}

How might we update existing, or create new patterns to improve Veteran authenticated experiences? 
 
## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans are able to more fully complete their VA.gov profiles
- Users providing personal data in an application that is then later used to complete additional applications

## Undesired User Outcomes
- 

## Desired Business Outcomes
- 6 - 8 VA reusable patterns for personalized, authenticated experiences are created
- Patterns are as easy as possible to implement across products and teams
- Documentation for personalization patterns ready for integration into both https://design.va.gov and https://designsystem.digital.gov

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Less than 4 patterns are delivered
- Patterns are not sufficient quality to be adopted by existing VA.gov applications retroactively (e.g. code and patterns/flows do not easily replace/adapt to existing code and patterns/flow)
- Patterns are not sufficiently account for the value in (and build on) existing in-production solutions on VA.gov
- Patterns are not meet sufficient quality measures to be integrated into the USWDS

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Once fully adopted by VA teams, we expect these to be indicators of success:
- A 15% or greater theoretical reduction in VA custom code by end of project overall and/or measurable performance improvement
- 5% or greater theoretical increase in the percentage of users with completed profiles on VA.gov
- {{need a KPI to hit for increase in prefill usage}}

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
