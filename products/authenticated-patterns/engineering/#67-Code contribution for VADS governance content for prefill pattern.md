# "Code Usage" Section of VADS Governance Content for Prefill Pattern

## Options for Presenting Pattern

1. **Storybook**
   - Create separate code examples for each component (e.g., prefill alert, gray card, etc.).
   - Demonstrate a comprehensive mock form example that incorporates all these components cohesively.
     - Show different steps of the mock form (e.g., edit page, contact info page) to illustrate how each component of the prefill pattern functions within the form.

2. **Code File Links**
   - Provide links to the code files similar to the approach used for the email address and phone number patterns. Note that it appears only existing web components within the Forms library follow this practice.

## Findings

- The majority of the pattern documentation lacks a “Code Usage” section. Instead, most patterns include the following under the “How to Design and Build” section:
  - **“Components Used in this Pattern”**: A list of components, each linking to its corresponding component documentation page.
  - **“Page Templates Used in this Pattern”**: Links to the Figma file for the pattern.
