# SCO Prototype Research Plan
*October 3-25, 2019*

## Product & team
In support of the Education team’s goal of updating the School Resources pages, we plan to conduct usability testing research to evaluate the effectiveness of the School Resources prototype. Based on the research, the School Resources prototype will be revised to ensure that SCOs and school administrators can easily find the information they need to support military-connected students.

## Background
Currently, VBA GI Bill School Resources comprises three pages on benefits.va.gov.  These pages provide resource links and documents for School Certifying Officials and administrators.  The resources allow users to complete required training and certification, view upcoming events and announcements, access various tools, and support military-connected students.

During the Discovery phase, we conducted interviews with SCOs, ELRs and SCO Hotline Representatives and analyzed existing research to determine how the SCOs’ and school administrators’ ability to access necessary VA resources and support military-connected students is hindered by the layout of the information on the current School Resources pages and the prevalence of out-of-date content.  Based on Discovery research findings, we created a prototype of the new School Resources pages.  


## Hypothesis
The improved organization, layout and functionality of the new School Resources pages will increase the SCOs’ and school administrator’s ability to locate key content and functionality that allows them to perform their job efficiently and better support military-connected students.  


 
## Research questions
The research is designed to answer the following questions:
1.	How might the user interface, information architecture, design or content be adjusted to improve usability?
2.	Are users able to easily locate the School Resources area of the site?
3.	Are users able to easily return to the School Resources page after viewing resources on other VA sites?
4.	Are users able to locate the resources that enable them to perform their job and support military-connected students?


## Method
### What method of research are you planning?
We will conduct usability testing on a high-fidelity prototype or on a live site in a demo environment with School Certifying Officials. 

### Why this method?
Usability testing will allow us to ensure that users can complete key tasks and locate necessary information. We will ask probing questions, as necessary, to fully understand the participant’s’ goals and objectives.  Conducting the sessions over WebEx will allow us to observe screen actions as participants engage with the site. 

### Where are you planning to do your research?
Interviews will be conducted remotely over WebEx. 

### What will you be reviewing?
During the sessions, we will review the School Resources prototype or demo site.  
 
## Participants and Recruitment
### Participant criteria
5 School Certifying Officials or School Administrators 
Our goal is a distribution of participants from schools with varying numbers of Post 9/11 GI Bill students.  
*	School with 500 or more 
*	School with 100-500 
*	School with 20-100 
*	School with less than 20 
*	School that is just beginning the certification process or is not yet certified (NOTE: If this proves a bit challenging, we can recruit an additional school that fits one of the size categories above)

SCO Experience: Ideally both newer and experienced SCOs.  This occurred naturally as we recruited for the last round of testing.

Age Range: Any

Geography: Ideally geographically dispersed across US

Technology: Access to a computer, preferably running Google Chrome browser

Familiarity with technology: Any

Accessibility preference: Any

### Recruitment strategy
Participants will be recruited by Booz Allen Hamilton by October 10, 2019

### Timeline
The sessions will be conducted October 15-17, 2019

### Artifact Preparation

### Length of Sessions
Each session will last no longer than 45 minutes.

### Availability
*	October 16th timeslots: 9AM, 11AM, 1PM, 3PM or 5PM
