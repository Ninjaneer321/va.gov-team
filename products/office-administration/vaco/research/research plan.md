# VA.gov CMS: Office user research 1

Timing: March 4-13, 2019

This research focuses on learning <b>how, when, where and what types of information target audiences seek from VA Public Affairs websites.</b> We will use this research to help us build an information architecture, content strategy and overall layout for the site pages based on their needs. Our aim is to understand how/if the public affairs websites are currently relevant to participants and to identify gaps so we can support their contexts and preferences when seeking content.

As someone who visits va.gov for outreach materials or OPIA content, I have been able to provide feedback to the people building the website so that I can more easily navigate it and find the information I need. This is achieved because the researchers were prepared for the research with a plan to execute, and participants lined up.

### Research Goals

- What prompts participants to seek information about the Department of Veterans Affairs?
- How do they begin their searches or investigations for information?
- What resources are most/least useful and why (Expecting to hear, "None of this is useful." When participants say that, prompt them to follow up by answering, "what I really need is (blank).")
- How do participants use VA-sponsored websites or information?
  - What is succeeding/failing about this information? 
  - What types of content do participants create for veterans?

### Methods

Sessions will be remote, moderated interviews (using Zoom.us) focused on evaluating the existing user journeys. 
Observing use of existing VA sources and then asking participants to organize content according to their needs and mental models are two methods that will help us develop an IA and page layouts based on user needs. 

The team plans on using inductive synthesis methods to derrive insights, including quotes, observations, and recommended user stories to catalyze design.

### Participants and Recruitment

Screening criteria
- 2 outreach leads from Big 6 VSOs (people VSO’s who help Veterans)
- 1-2 media representative or journalists who focus entirely on gov or veteran issues
- 1-2 Congressional staffers
  - Folks in Congress who ask VA for any information, including appeals
- Folks at Regional Offices (medical advisors, etc)

The VA.gov CMS team will be conducting the recruit.

### Roles

Please list the people who will be serving in each role. Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers.
