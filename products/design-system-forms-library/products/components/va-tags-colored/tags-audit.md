# Research Report: Tag Usage Across VA Digital Products  
**Date:** August 2025

**Context:**  This report summarizes input from various teams in response to a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/discussions/4537) on best practices and current implementations of tags within VA digital products. The goal is to better understand where and how tags are being used, the limitations of current approaches, and considerations for improving design consistency.

**Mural:** [Mural with tags used in production](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1755032896804/d24a5a32988c08139ddf73a67e589c7fa9e9f22d?wid=0-1755887451627)

## üß© Summary of Responses

### 1. Financial Management Team

- **Current Implementation:** Uses the status indicator implemented in [Cards](https://design.va.gov/components/card#status-via-label-with-indicator)
- **Use Case:** Needs to show status inside a card with long lines of text
- **Design Differences:** Using status indicators and not tags.
- **Tag words:** Not using tags. Using the status indictor in cards instead
- **Reflection:** Add status indicators as a component could provide teams an option for showing status when the text goes beyond 20 characters.

### 2. Accredited Rep Team

- **Current Implementation:**  Uses a light gray variation of the tags that aren't in the Design System
- **Tag words:** Pending, Declined
- **Design Differences:**
- **Use Case:**  Used to show statuses like pending and declined inside a card
- **Reflection:** This team could switch to the new colored tags to show statuses.

### 3. 10-10EZ

- **Current Implementation:** Used to show progress through a process with each step. Looks similar to the [UK.GOV pattern to multiple tasks](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/complete-multiple-tasks/).
- **Tag words:** Not started, Optional, Completed
- **Use Case:** Showing progress while completing multiple steps
- **Design Differences:**  Uses a green tag to indicate "complete" and a gray tag to indicate "optional". 
- **Reflection:** Mixing the gray tag within the light green tags can be create unneeded emphasis on optional tasks.

### 4. 526EZ & 686c:Add and remove dependents

- **Current Implementation:**  Uses the default gray tag in a card.
- **Tag words:** Incomplete, Complete
- **Use Case:**  Standard use case for tags used in a card

### 5. Rep Portal

- **Current Implementation:**  Use the default gray tag and also a light gray tag option. 
- **Use Case:**  Used to show status inside cards 
- **Tag words:** Received, Accepted, Declined
- **Design Differences:**  A light gray variation and the default gray variation is being used
- **Reflection:** I think both use cases shared can be moved over to the new colored tags. 

### 6. Appointments:MHV online scheduling

- **Current Implementation:**  Uses the default gray tag in a card. As a interactive filter chip with a close button that changes the results of filters applied. Uses a tag on a page that shows the status of the entire page.
- **Design differences**: 
- **Use Case:**  Inside a card to show when a appointment invite will expire
- **Tag words:** Expires [MM/DD/YYYY], Processing, Accepted, 
- **Design Differences:**  Tags are used in cards and also at the top of pages to indicate the status. The tag is modified to be interactive as a filter chip. 
- **Reflection:** The use cases shared could fit with the two planned components here. The search filter chip and the colored tag component currently being looked at.
