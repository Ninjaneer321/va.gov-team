## Summary
The Sidenav component provides a consistent, accessible, and responsive side navigation panel for web applications. It is designed to help users quickly navigate between major sections or features within a page or application. The Sidenav is intended for use in layouts where persistent or easily accessible navigation is essential, such as dashboards, admin panels, and complex workflows.
  
## Objectives
- The Sidenav component organizes navigation links, section headers, icons, and potentially sub-menus into a vertical layout that is both space-efficient and easy to scan.
- The component supports highlighting the active section, collapsing or expanding menu groups, and adapting its display for various screen sizes (responsive behavior).
- Users will use the sidenav to jump directly to different areas of the application, understand their current location, and maintain orientation as they navigate.

## Key Features of the Component:
- Accessibility: Ensures compliance with WCAG standards and maintains ease of use for all users.
- Responsiveness: Adapt gracefully to a range of device sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices; support collapsible modes as needed.
- Customizability: Allow for configurable menu items, icons, section headers, and states (active, disabled, etc.).
- Integration: Facilitate easy integration into existing layouts and work seamlessly with other design system components such as headers, footers, and content areas.
