# Research Plan: Baseline Wayfinding Research on VA.gov 
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get a baseline understanding of how the current VA.gov website is being used by Veterans and others. With a better understanding of Veterans' pain points and successes while using VA.gov, we can make more informed decisions about priorities for future research and design work in website navigation and tools.   

## Background
Since the current VA.gov website was launched in 2018, there hasn't been much user research on the website's overall design. Recent research studies have focused on specific search or browse pages but not on overall wayfinding. Analytics data indicate where people are clicking on pages and what search strings they try, but not whether they're finding what they're looking for. 

This research is planned within the context of the Public Websites team and the larger Unauthenticated crew, but it may also provide insights for the Authenticated teams and overall website information architecture.  

## Research questions
- How do Veterans accomplish a list of common tasks?
  - Where do they typically start? (Google/Facebook/MHV/eBenefits/contact center call or email/VA.gov)
  - If not using VA.gov, why? (e.g., don't know about it, too hard to use)
  - What do they typically do on VA.gov? What tools have they tried using?
    - Search (in header)
    - "VA Benefits and Health Care" dropdown in header
    - Other header links (About VA, Find a VA Location, Contact us)
    - "Top 4" boxes
    - Topics below the photos
    - 3 red/blue buttons below the topics
    - Links below the 3 red/blue buttons
    - Footer links 
    - Resources & Support
    - Find a Form
- Do they find what they're looking for? If not, what were they looking for?
- What pain points are there in terms of findability and usage?
- What works well?
- What differences are there for desktop *vs.* smartphone users?
- What differences are there for people who have cognitive disabilities?
- What differences are there for people who use screen readers?
- What differences are there for people who have used VA.gov before *vs.* haven't used it?
- Do Veterans read/notice/click/comment on the banner content on the home page?

## Hypotheses
- Veterans are focused on what they’re looking for and don’t want to navigate multiple tools unless it helps them get better results.
- Veterans don't care where the information they're looking for is stored, as long as they are able to find it.
- Veterans aren't using all of the current search and browse tools on VA.gov. 	

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants will be asked a series of interview questions about their past usage of the VA.gov site and demonstrate some of what they've done, and then will be given some common Veteran tasks (pulled from [list compiled here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/Veteran%20Tasks%20on%20VA.gov.xlsx)) as wayfinding prompts to explore the live VA.gov website.

We will also explore analytics data to see where people click on the VA.gov home page and compare usage statistics across the different search and browse tools on the site.

## Participants and Recruitment	
Ask Perigean to recruit 20 people in order to get 12 completed sessions using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
- At least 6 Veterans
- At least 3 caregivers or family members of a Veteran who assist the Veteran in getting benefits 
- At least 5 people who plan to use their computer for the session
- At least 5 people who plan to use their smartphone for the session
- At least 4 people with a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI)
- At least 3 participants over 60

### Good to have for participants
- At least 2 people who use a screen reader
- At least 2 people who have never used the VA.gov website before
- At least 2 people of color
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 participant 35 or under
- At least 2 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 1 person that has a college degree (to include officer Veterans)
- At least 2 people who live in a rural or remote area
- At least 1 person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least 1 non-native English speaker

### Recruitment requirements for ALL participants
- Have a computer or smartphone and be willing to be complete their interview on a computer or smartphone
- During the session, be willing to share a browser window showing VA.gov on their computer or smartphone 
- Have a working microphone on their computer or smartphone
- Have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and know how to share their screen

### Additional questions to ask in the screener
- Have you used the VA.gov website before? 
  - If yes, how recently? 
  - If yes, on what device(s)--computer, tablet, or smartphone? 
- What kind of device will you be joining on and are willing to share a browser window on--computer, tablet, or smartphone?
