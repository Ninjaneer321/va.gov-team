# IRIS Research Plan  for July 2020
**7/21/2020**

This document outlines a research plan for understanding the IRIS experience for those using VA.gov.

## Goals

The VA CTO Office has engaged ThoughtWorks to explore the potential of rebuilding or replacing elements of the Inquiry Routing & Information System (IRIS): https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/.  The goals of this research include:

- Evaluate the current user experience with IRIS
- Understand what can be improved, removed, added, or reorganized within the system

Our hypothesis is that most veterans prefer to self-serve their needs on VA.gov digitally, and they call-in or submit a query only if online resources are not easy to find or cannot address their queries. If we are able to streamline the process of finding info on VA.gov via a better user experience than the one provided by the current IRIS interface, more number of queries will be addressed for the veterans and we should see a corresponding increase in customer satisfaction scores.



## Method
We will be conducting interviews with end users about their experiences with IRIS - ideally service members but could be members of the general public who use the function (i.e. family members of service members). An open ended discussion (using a number of questions to get started) will allow us to understand end users’ needs.

These interviews will be recorded and moderated remotely using Zoom.



## Participants and Recruitment
Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant? (Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)

We are seeking 5 participants and will work with Perigean to recruit participants. 

Criteria:
- Veterans, Service members, National Guard and Reserve, Their family members and friends
- Participant has used IRIS (https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/app/ask) in the past 6 months and ideally can speak to the challenges they make have experienced with it.
- Mix of genders
- Mix of ages

Bonus: 
- Those with accessibility requirements and overseas locations (either currently or recently stationed overseas)

We will be using remote participation in light of COVID-19 and will work with Perigiean on recruitment likely from their existing sources.

## When? 	

We would like to begin testing the week of August 3rd. We will have participants walk through their experience with IRIS in its current state. Each session will be one hour long.

Availability Monday to Friday 9 - 5 EST 

This research plan has been reviewed with the IRIS team.
