# Research Plan for VSP, Ask VA - Dashboard (Business, Personal), January 2022


## Background
This study is being conducted by the VSP Contact Center team. The study follows the Ask VA (AVA) tool, which enables veterans and VA.gov users to submit inquiries digitally. The AVA product team released a new tab function with labels (Business, Personal) in December 2021. The study will provide feedback for this new feature to AVA product team. 

[Link to product brief](url goes here).

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following:

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
- Platform users can build and deploy high-quality products for Veteran


### Veteran Journey
AVA’s improved mobile experience fits within these stages of the Veteran Journey:
  ·  Phase 1, Life Stage: Getting Out through Phase 3: Retiring and Aging 


## Research Goals	
We are trying to learn the following from this research:
  · Document and prioritize any outstanding usability concerns with AVA, including both inquiry submission and the authenticated dashboard.
  · Verify the implementation of new dashboard upgrades, and help SCOs and VA employees with handling caseloads in AVA. 


### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
  · This research will advance AskVA product and streamline more upgrades in the design process. We believe our learnings will solidify a more efficient workflow for SCOs and VA employees handling cases in AVA. 

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
  · Do the recent UI upgrades (Tabs: Personal, Business) in the Dashboard make a better overall experience? 
  · Are the users (SCOs and VA employees) able to find and filter inquiries successfully and without hindrance?
  · Are users able to navigate and access inquiries regarding benefits, GI Bill faster via the new dashboard tabs?
  · Do users understand the new tabs and their functions? 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
  · The new tab feature, released for the week Dec 10, 2021, will create much-needed views for AVA users (SCOs and VA employees) handling cases specific to GI Bill and VA Benefits. 
  · There will be less burden for users handling cases in the AVA dashboard specific to the GI Bill and Benefits inquiries.  
  · Though the business tab will create a specific view of inquiries, there is possibly a lack of understanding of how the tab appears for users. 
  · Insights provided by the participants would provide guidance on needed onboarding of the new tabs and their functionality.
