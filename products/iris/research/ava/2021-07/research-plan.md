# Research Plan for VSP, Ask VA, July 2021

## Goals

This study is being conducted by the VSP Contact Center team. The study follows the Ask VA (AVA) tool, which enables veterans and VA.gov users to submit inquiries digitally.

**Usability Study Goals:**

- Document and prioritize any outstanding usability concerns with AVA, including both inquiry submission and the authenticated dashboard.
- Verify the implementation of recommendations provided from previous usability testing.

**Research Questions:**

- Are users able to submit inquiries successfully and without hindrance?
- Are users able to navigate and access previous inquiries via the authenticated dashboard?
- Do veterans understand how to fill out all of the fields on the inquiry form?
  - Is help text provided in all the appropriate areas?
  - Do users understand which fields are required? 

**Hypothesis:**

- Due to implementation of previous study findings, Veterans will be able to successfully submit inquires through AVA.
- There will be a reduction (when compared to previous study) in confusion and questions around specific inquiry fields and the review page.

## Method

We will conduct remote moderated usability testing and directed interviews via Zoom using the Perigean contract. These methods will help us:

## Participants and Recruitment

We are seeking to perform this test with 10 participants

**Must have for participants**

- Users who have visited and logged in to VA.gov within the past year

**Good to have for participants**

- Users that have a VA.gov login
- *If possible, would like to have roughly 2-3 participants who would answer "yes" to the following question:*
  - Have you visited VA.gov on a mobile device?
  - Participants who have visited VA.gov on their mobile device should login to the Zoom session on their mobile device.

## When?

**Desired Timeline: July 12-23, 2021**
60 minutes (45-minute session with 15-minute buffer)
