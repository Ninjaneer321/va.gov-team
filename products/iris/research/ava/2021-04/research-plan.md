# Research Plan for Ask VA, April 2021


## Goals


### Usability Study Goals



*   What, if any, changes need to be implemented before the full release of the Ask VA (AVA) 
*   Explore topics such as Customer Satisfaction & Trust, Findability and (Task) Service Completion
*   Testing full AVA experience
*   Testing the content of the form


### Research Questions



*   Does AVA provide end users with a user-friendly method of submitting inquiries for issues regarding VA.gov?
*   What are end users expectations in regards to inquiry submissions?
    *   Expectations in regards to: information needed to submit an inquiry, response time, login information, etc?
*   Does AVA provide an interface that elicits trust from the end user?
*   Is “plain language” utilized throughout the entirety of the AVA application?


### Hypothesis



*   Though users will be able to successfully submit a new inquiry, they will experience areas of uncertainty throughout the process. 


## Method

We will conduct moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. The test will consist of a series of sequential tasks (roughly 5-10 tasks) that will take the user through the process of utilizing AVA to Ask a Question. These tasks will include, but are not limited to, the following:



*   Finding and accessing the link to visit the AVA portal
*   Start a new inquiry
*   Navigating through the various steps included in the New Inquiry form
*   Completion and submission of a new inquiry
*   Navigating away from the submission confirmation page

In addition to completing the above tasks, users will also be asked to vocalize their experience throughout the duration of the process. This will help gain insight into the users expectations and pain points.


## Participants and Recruitment

We are seeking to perform this test with 15 participants, 10 on desktop and 5 on mobile.

**Must have for participants**



*   We are seeking to perform this usability test with 5 mobile participants. Therefore, five participants who answer yes to:
    *   Have you visited VA.gov on your mobile device previously?"

**Good to have for participants**



*   Participants who have previously interacted with VA.gov in reference to their GI Bill.
*   If possible, would like to have roughly 2-3 participants who would answer "yes" to the follow question:
    *   Do you currently use a screen reader to navigate website?


## When?

**Desired Timeline: April 14-23, 2020**

45 minutes (30 minute session with 15 minute buffer)
