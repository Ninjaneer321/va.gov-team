﻿**We conducted 4-30 minute usability sessions with a clickable prototype of the “Sample Template” feature with  Zoom screen sharing. We gave the participants a set of tasks to complete while thinking aloud.**

**Some scenarios were:**
-   **If you were trying to create an email notification, how would you do that**
-   **If you were stuck (with a blank page) what would you do?**

**Based on the sessions conducted, we validated that the sample template feature is quick, intuitive and easy to use. Some common trends we heard were that the process was streamlined,  straightforward,  and they loved the tool.**

**ADDL FEATURE REQUESTS**
-   Alert warning that they are about to overwrite contents in the editor.
-   Italics added & markdown built out in the formatting key
-   Some sort of UTM Parameter tutorial.
-   Ability to Test Send.
-   Ability to Duplicate, Rename, and Delete Templates from main screen.
-   Combining the preview and write tabs into a Side-by-side Editor.
-   Promote to production (potentially just copy).
-   From main screen be able to start with blank notification or a template.
