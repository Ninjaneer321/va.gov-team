# VA Notify Self Service Usability Testing Round 1

## Purpose
The purpose of this study is to test the usability of the self service interface with users and gather feedback. During this study, our goal is to answer the following questions.
- Are participants able to successfully navigate the interface and perform the requested tasks?
- Are the necessary features available at the right time?
- Are participants comfortable using this interface to self service their notification needs?
- Do participants feel more confident about their notifications?

## Method
Participants will be given a series of tasks to complete using a clickable prototype. The sessions will be remotely moderated over Zoom. Each session will have one participant and run 30 minutes.

## Participants
Internal VA team members who have worked with VA Notify are our target participants. Our goal is five participants from a variety of disciplines.

## Discussion Guide
Thank you for joining today. We’re excited to hear your feedback. I will share a prototype link with you and ask you to share your screen and talk aloud as we walk through a few scenarios. Keep in mind that this is a prototype and not everything will behave as you expect. Please remember to speak out loud about what you are seeing and thinking as you interact with the prototype.

**Do you mind if I record this session for my note taking?**

### Warm up questions
- Have you used VA Notify to send notifications? If so, what notifications?
- What do you know about VA Notify self service?

### Tasks
**Your business stakeholder asks if the 526EZ confirmation email contains a confirmation number. Verify if there is a confirmation number sent to Veterans in the email.**
- Does the participant successfully navigate to the correct template?
- Does the participant understand the confirmation number personalization?

**Add a link to disability compensation FAQs to the 526EZ confirmation email.**
- Does the participant successfully edit the template?
- Does the participant understand the template language?

**You would like to test that the 526EZ confirmation email looks correct in your inbox. How would you do this?**
- Does the participant understand how to send a test email?
- What are their expectations for what they will receive in their inbox?

**You would like to send a new email notification when a 1010EZ application is submitted. How would you do this?**
- Is the participant able to create a new notification?
- Do they understand the purpose of the notification name?
- Do they value previewing before saving?

**Your business stakeholder asks you how many confirmation emails have been sent for 526EZ confirmation. Find this information.**
- Is the participant able to find this information?
- Does this information make sense?
- What other information might they find valuable?

**You are going on vacation next week and need to check that Mike Leonard has access to the templates you are working on. Verify if Mike Leonard has that capability.**
- Is the participant able to find this information?
- Does “service” mean anything to the participant?
- Are they able to give the user access to edit the template?

### Wrap-up
- Can you describe your overall experience while completing the tasks? What worked well, what didn’t?
- How would you feel using this interface to manage your existing notifications?
- Is there anything missing from the interface you would expect?
