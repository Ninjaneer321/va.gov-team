# Research Plan for Disability Compensation Notifications
**7/2/2020**

This document outlines a research plan for notifications used throughout Veteran's journey while applying, waiting, and receiving disability compensation benefits.
## Goals
The notifications service (VANotify) enables emails and text messages to be sent to users with relevant information as they interact with VA. This research will focus on the disability compensation benefit including applying, waiting, receiving a decision, and receiving payment to understand what information Veterans value and how they would like to receive that information. Findings from this research will also be used to inform general notification experience guidelines to assist future teams in creating Veteran facing notifications. Specific goals include:
- Understand what information Veterans expect and value in a notification
- Determine when email vs text message notifications are most appropriate
- Understand when Veteran expect to receive notifications

## Method
We will conduct remote testing over zoom using a user journey map in Mural to aid the conversation.

## Participants and Recruitment
We are seeking 8 participants and will work with Perigean to recruit participants.  
Criteria:
- Have applied for disability compensation (form 526EZ) on va.gov (not via paper application)
- Mix of genders
- Mix of ages

## When?
Sessions are expected to run 45 minutes  
**Availability:**  
Wednesday July 22 8AM ET - 1PM ET  
Thursday July 23 8AM ET - 3PM ET  
Friday July 24 8AM ET - 3PM ET  

A pilot session will take place Tuesday, July 21 at 3PM ET with Marisa Hoenig

## Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker**
