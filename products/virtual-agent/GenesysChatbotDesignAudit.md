# Genesys Chatbot Design Audit
As an excercise to see where the Genesys chatbot falls inline with the VA Design system, an audit was done to find the gaps and note the limits of the customization of the Genesys chatbot.

1. CORNER RADIUS: There is no ability for the user to customize the corner radius sizes of the outer container window or the inner dialgue chat window.  The VA.gov Design System (VADS) uses specific shape tokens and spacing units to define border radius standards across its interface. These standards ensure consistency and approachability for digital services on the VA.gov platform. There are currently 3 semantic token sizes for border radii (small - 2 pixels, medium - .5 em space and large - 1 em space).
2. TEXT: The text size and styles are not able to be edited by the user in Genesys. The VA Design System has a very specific set of sizes, weights, styles, line spacing (leading and kerning) for the different uses of "headlines", "body text", "captions" and other stylings that are used in the heiracrchy of typography on any given page.
