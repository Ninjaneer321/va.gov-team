# Important Qualitative Findings:

## Service Design challenges:


> My account is currently under audit review. They have screwed up my claim since the file date of 2 Aug 2022. I have filed a congressional complaint request for help!

> I've been trying all the month of December to get answers to why my benefits were used to pay medical debts that were not my financial responsibility! I demand answers!

> UPLOAD A WAIVER REQUEST AS A VSO USING MY VA.GOV EMAIL ACCOUNT FOR A CLIENT WITH A DEBT.  VA STATES THAT THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO SUBMIT A WAIVER REQUEST FOR OUR CLIENTS, BUT I DO NOT SEE IT EVEN WORKS.

> We need to achieve a resolution regarding this ongoing inquiry regarding my VA compensation matter.  I submitted a Congressional argument in June to get this mess resolved. No contact has been received by any means from the VA in attempt to resolve this matter nor communicate with me the status or pending resolution. To make matters worse, VA just issued a check for retro-compensation dated Jan 23-22 thru Jan -28-22 in the amount of $[0000.0] on Nov 29 2024. Why would the VA issue a compensation check when there is allegedly a debt. Furthermore, according to this source, the debt has been reduced yet no correspondence from the VA. Someone call me!!!!

> VA USES AT LEAST THREE DIFFERENT REFERENCE NUMBERS for referencing a single bill. VA hospital uses two or three, then PAY.GOV USES ANOTHER REFERENCE NUMBER FOR SAME hospital event / treatment / same date / SAME PRESCRIPTION. Then, PAYMENTS ARE LEFT ONLINE AND NEVER UPDATED FOR MONTHS, ONLINE. VA payments agenda is a confusing mess, which requires EXTREMELY CLOSE ATTENTION, so one does not overpay or pay twice.

> I got my bill, paid late, but was also sent to collections. was there another bill , I did not know about,


## Not enrolled in VA health care error message

N = 3 

12/5 - 12/9

>The system tells me I am not enrolled when I am.

> I have a debt to pay, it doesn't show on the debt portal that I have a debt to pay. I got sent in the mail about an overpayment on education benefits.
