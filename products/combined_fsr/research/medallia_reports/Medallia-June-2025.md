https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction

The FSR custom survey appears on the confirmation page of the [Financial Status Report (5655)](http://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction). To access this survey, users click on a modal button that asks for feedback towards the top of the page to launch the survey. All responses are optional, there are no required questions so users can decide on their own which questions to respond to. 

In reporting spreadsheets, this survey is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

Only appears on the FSR confirmation page (blue button > modal)  
At the end of the form after confirmation or approval message (positive), less of a negative response bias

This is a look back at all of the responses for the 6 questions on the  FSR custom survey June 1 - June 30, 2025.


## 1. I was able to easily complete this form online.

| None | 51 |

| Relief options | 3 |
| Assets | 1 |
| Final Review | 0 |

## 3. What specific changes, if any, would you like to see in the form to make it more user-friendly and easier?

Open text field provided.

### None, NA, N/A, no suggestions, positive feedback

N = 7

### Positive feedback left

Example quotes: 

> This is one of the easiest forms I have filled out. No changes neccessary.

> form was easy to fill out and has all info I guess they need to decide the outcome.

> None, asked everything I guess they needed.


### Timely feedback given Financial Management team's recent discussions

> In the relief options there is no mention if other relief would be given if the original planned choice does not become approved.


### Top of mind concerns

> Allow for a response on why the veteran is having difficulty paying the debt.

> More specific areas to respond with explanation.  For example, I have a mortgage in my name as the Veteran but do not make any payments due to the divorce decree.  The student loan section could have an explanation section to put, "forbearance" instead of just $0.

> Completing online is lacking a way to correct errors such as expenses.

Accessibilility: 

> Make sure the form is actually accessible. I have tried to access this form on two separate occasions and have been unsuccessful due to system issues.



### Notable feedback to make expenses section more all encompassing 

> There was no option to put on the for the car payments.

>Area for additional expenses

> I pay child support which is a debt I didn't see an option under expenses.


### Banruptcy

> IT DID NOT ASK ME ABOUT MY BANKRUPTCY

> Bankruptcy should have a statue of limitation on timeframe last completed.

> When a bankruptcy is over 25 years old, it's difficult to remember details. I've had an auto accident with brain damage and have cognitive issues so I do NOT remember the details for this question.

> The ability to append a notes such as:  Bankruptcy was Filed 4/21/2025 (Case #


### Income

> Spouse does get benefits, but income is included

### Service design feedback 

> I would like it,if someone  actually responds to me already update me on my status I never receive  any communication  back..and am nit getting the assistance  that I'm needing.

> The fact is I qualify for medicaid as of 3/1/2025 and you have me enter all this data that is not neccessary to solve my issue

> Does not indicate how to apply for permanent relief. I am destitute



### Notable feedback about optimizing UX efficiency on form, navigation, and findability of the form

> ask less information

> would like to see less redundancy when filling out the application. Some of the same information requested is requested again on the form. In this day and age, information should auto format once filled in prior.

### Improving ease  - ideas

> IT WOULD BE BETTER IF A PDF VIEW OF FORM 5655 COULD BE SHOWN AS YOU ARE FILLING OUT THE ELECTRONIC VERSION

> inform the 'reader' to READ! It was so much easier after I READ the instructions.

> For some reason it did not have my benefits or amount on there.


### Marriage options (recurring theme in previous monthly reports)

> Add a section for people that are legally separated

### Uploading supporting documents (uploading documents to forms - recurring feedback in the most recent study as of June 2025 and in May 2025 Medallia Report)

> The form is good as is but I believe it can become more user friendly if it had a place where you could attached supporting documentation.

### Misc

>  Spot to list credit card debt as a lump sum

> If someone feels the mistake was on rthe other party why does the option to have a deduction from each month was not found here

### Explore possible bug 

> I had to constantly go back, refresh the page, and re-log in to get the page to work. Several times throughout, the page would redirect to a "sorry, this page could not be found" banner if I clicked too fast.

> Does not let me fill expenses and a persona statement.  Cuts me off to add this info.  Why?

> Sometimes changes made don't save and that can cause headaches when having to reload a page or something.

## 4. I would recommend completing this form online instead of paper to another Veteran?
