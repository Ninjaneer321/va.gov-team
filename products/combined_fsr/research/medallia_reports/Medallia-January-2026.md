## *Data time span: January 1 \- 31, 2026*

Responses (surveys) received: 454

# **Standard Medallia Survey Data on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov)** 

Veterans currently submit regular feedback about their [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) experience while visiting the site through [two different surveys.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/accessing-and-utilizing-contact-center-data#AccessingandUtilizingContactCenterData-WhattoDoWiththeData) 

This portion of the report analyzes the two open field text responses gathered from these two surveys.

1. **Medallia Feedback Survey:** Accessed by clicking the blue ‘feedback’ button located at the bottom of most [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) pages. In reports this is known as `VA.gov VFS Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “What task were you trying to do today?”  
      
2. **Medallia Intercept Survey:** Randomly intercepts 5% of [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) visitors who have had a 20-second or more session.  In reports this is known as `VA.gov A11 Questionnaire`

   The open field text question asks, “Why did you select that rating?”

All survey responses analyzed here are from respondents who visited and referenced pages in any part of the /manage-va-debt/ experience.

The following section aggregates the themes from the two above open text field questions.

### **Most responses convey a high level of general satisfaction with site usability and information accessibility.  Many say that it is easy and they find what they need.**

*80 responses*

* "Always easy to log on and pay my co-pays."

* "Thank you for a great experience online as always, team!"

* "I selected this rating because the site is very informative and i can find what I am looking for quite easy."

### Improvements needed

*78 responses*

**Not current/updated enough** 
(majority of improvement comments)

* "I already paid a copay twice and VA too slow to acknowledge."

* "information provided is not up to date. For example, my copay balance is in error, and though I have spoken with someone about this quite some time ago, I see that as of today, 0-26-26, it is still not correct."

* "I am trying to pay my co-payments, but no new balances past August 2025 are available."

* "My copay is not up to date , I don't see my payments and have a new refill , not reflected ! I always pay my bills on time , bet here on this site it seems impossible!!"

* "On the Overpayments & copaybills page, your statements showing are not updated on time. This page should update immediately once a payment is received. I shouldn't have to call the finance department to find out that I am correct and that what is showing is only updated once per 30 days. Very bad accounting practice. Also, when calling the accounting department, they do not use invoice numbers. We do not know if we are discussing the same invoice. Another bad practice."

* "I'm sure I paid my bill several weeks ago it still shows unpaid I'm trying to find out the new amount it's been over a month that has been updated. Good time from the bill amounts published to when I have to pay is getting shorter and the amount is getting bigger"

**Other**

* "Just want to pay my copay, sure wish there was some kind of automatic payment system"

* "How does the VA not offer auto-pay!? Get out of the stone age folks! Many of those who you purport to 'serve' are elderly with limited capacity to write you a check every month. Auto-pay is a feature that the vast majority of even the smallest companies offer. Do better VA."

* "In my case, I would like to pay for my meds with my VA Disability. Instead of going into another website to pay. If going into another website have all the information available like account number already fixed. Travel claims got better. The co- pay can improve."

* "Because there is not complete detailed information regarding overpayment to understand how the VA came up with the number it did. This is creating confusion."

* "Because this information should be on the VA app"

* "I would like to have access to copayments which I've already paid, so I would know if I still owe the amount shown ."

* "Health care cost depends on group number but there is nowhere to find out my group number."

* "Filed a dispute against my overpayment debt, but there is no way to track or see the status of the dispute."


### Potential bugs
*19 responses*

**Overpayment information on the Resolve page**

* "Pay my copay, to wit: 1. Log in to VA.gov home 2. Click "Pay copay bills" 3. It says "$123.26 for 3 copay bills" 4. Nowhere is there a "Pay" option 5. Click "Review details..." 6. Goes to Copay balances (there is again no "Pay" option) 7. Click "Review Details" 8. Says Copay details Current balance: $24.00 Payment due: February 15, 2026 9. Still no "Pay" option 10. ???"
**- 1/22/2026, /copay-balances/[customid], Windows 11, Chrome**

* "I figured it out. You have to delete the last letter of the person field. Automation is a waste of time if you're going to do it wrong."
**- 1/17/2026, /debt-balances/[customid]/resolve, Linux Chrome**

* "pay my debt online. The information you displayed isn't even the same fields that are requested on the linked website. Frankly, its [redacted] and there is no other word to describe the fact that you don't put the exact same descriptors on both websites. also, the person entitled has too many characters and is rejected by the other system. seriously, the only word is [redacted]. very happy with 99 percent of va stuff, this page and the linked pay online page are in that 1 percent. whoever is in charge of both pages should be punished for not matching the other after all this time."
**- 1/17/2026, /debt-balances/[customid]/resolve, Linux Chrome**

* "Pay debt online using info provided online. Info on site (Receivable ID) doesn't match wording on debt management site (File Number). Person Entitled Field on VA site has too may letters to fit into data field at https://www.pay.va.gov/ It made me unsure if that was supposed to be the same number to just copy it over, or if it was supposed to be a social security number or some other number. The field names and data on the VA debt balance site should match up with that on the pay.va.gov site so there's no doubt they're the same. These inconsistencies probably cause more calls to the phone center, rather than folks just simply paying online. Thanks for looking into it."
**- 1/6/2026, /debt-balances, Windows 10 Chrome**

**Disappearing debt**

* "The initial page appears to show that I have an outstanding overpayment debt. When i click on the link, its states NO debt. Either I have a debt or I don't. Be more specific on this page so I don't waste my time clicking around thinking I have a debt."
**- 1/6/2026, /debt-balances, Windows 11 Edge**

**Resolve page won't load**

*"I'm on ChampVA. I'm unable to download EOBs or view copays on this site. You're often late in mailing EOBs and I need to pay my bills on time."
**- 1/14/2026, /copay-balances, Windows 11 Chrome**

* "Pay my VA co-pay bill. The link ["Resolve your bill"] takes me to a page that says "Sorry, cannot find that page...""
  **- 1/13/26, /copay-balances/[customid], Windows 11 Chrome**

* "Trying to request help with medicine bill but the link does not appear and the resolve bill online link does not work either, you just press the button and nothing happens."
  **- 1/13/26, /copay-balances/[customid], Android Chrome**

* "Pay RX co-pays. https://www.va.gov/copay-balances/[customid]/resolve not functional"
**- 1/12/26, /copay-balances/[customid], iOS DuckDuckGo Private Browser**

* "Resolve my bill. The link does not work."
  **- 1/7/2026, /copay-balances/[customid], Windows 11 Chrome**

* "I can't access the pay co-pay page. When I select it there is a little circle in the middle of the screen that goes round and round, but the page does not come up."
    **- 1/3/2026, /copay-balances, macOS Safari**


**Other**

* "pages responding slow or not responding"

### Service Design
*26 responses*

**Inconsistent information, difficulty resolving overpayments**
* "On October 27, 2025, I filed a dispute with the VA Debt Management Center regarding a VRE-related debt of $288.88. Without my knowledge or notification, an adjustment was made on December 10, 2025, reducing the balance to $255.92, which the VA then treated as a valid debt despite no notice of this change being provided to me. On January 14, 2026, the VA withheld $255.92 from my disability backpay for a dependent addition which had to be resubmitted after the VA "lost" my initial paperwork for my dependent to be added. After speaking again with Debt Management, I was informed that an additional $25 would be withheld in February. Throughout this entire period, the VA website continued to show that I had zero bills due. This pattern of undisclosed adjustments, contradictory information, and unauthorized withholdings has significantly undermined my trust in the VA's debt handling processes and is unacceptable."

* "I have been dealing with this overpayment debt for 9 months now. Being given incorrect information and now it has financially hurting me and my family. After several months of being told the wrong thing we were finally given the correct information. Processed all information that was requested and now 60 days later it's still in the step that I started with 2 months nothing has happened after being given bad info for 7 months. Terrible is all I can say with no solution in sight."

* "Some of my information is incorrect or outdated, particularly when it concerns a debt, which requires more transparency, not less. Those sections of the website tend to be the least accurate. I used to have a very high level of trust in the VA. In the last 3 weeks, the VA misled me about a debt repayments, telling me that less than half my pension would be taken, even though all of it has. I will not be paying rent this month. The VA has failed to do basic diligence in reading my correspondence and entering correct numbers into the record. The VA has continued to make it difficult to submit documents regarding income change. Where is the form and link for this? Where is the simple, black and white information? To this day, I have never found it. Unacceptable. These are easy changes. Please make them."

* "My claim was closed, but it did not even address my request for a board appeal. I can never talk to a decision maker. I submit paperwork as directed by customer service, they am told months later it is incorrect or they need additional information and then you do not even answer my original question."

* "I do not owe this money it was a mistake by the VA. I have paperwork to prove it"

* "Still waiting for dependents to be put back onto my benefits for almost 4 months now. Customer service reps when called don't have all information to give to make sure veterans claims are filed correctly."

**VA medical center service**
* "I am very satisfied with my care and treatment at the VA"

* "I find the Biloxi VA to be exceptional. That said the texts that art sent as appointment reminders could be improved with a little more descriptive detail."

* "because they need to be well versed of whats good for the patient. sometime patients use civilian doctors or specialist. So, the VA needs to be more accommodating. To be able to accept medications the civilian doctors offer for the patient."


### **Issues with the intercept survey**
*6 responses*

* "I just logged in 30 seconds ago and haven't had time to do anything yet."

* "You're asking me for feedback before I've even been able to do what I came here to do."

* "I am getting the questionaire before I even get to the actual place I am searching for. Plus I am disappointed that the phone app doesn't work so I have to use the website."

* "I am navigating the site for the first time and have not assessed its merits."

* "you stopped me to take this quiz"

* "Your more interested in feedback than me finding the information I need."

**Additionally, all feedback related to other sections of VA.gov was received via the intercept survey.**

*32 responses*

### **Comments related to other sections of VA.gov**
* "Can't load claim decision are rating decisions."

* "Prescription refill request easily submitted."

* "It's easy to navigate and up to date on appointments and getting quick responses from secure e-mails"

* "This new website is worse than the previous myhealthyvet website. This website is not user friendly."

* "Since the transfer options are more easy to navigate"

* "IT TOOK 4 TIMES TO SIGN IN,,AND I COULD NOT FIND MY TEST RESULTS FROM MY LAST WALK IN APPT."



# **Custom Financial Management Medallia Survey for Financial Status Report (VA form 5655\)** 

In addition to the two standard surveys, the Financial Management Team has created a custom survey to monitor the experience for VA form 5655, a financial status report form, which a Veteran submits to request help with VA debt for overpayments and bills.

To access the custom survey, Veterans first complete and submit the [Financial Status Report (5655)](http://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction). On the confirmation page, Veterans may click on a blue “Provide feedback” button to access the survey, which consists of four questions. Responses are optional. In reports this is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

#### **Form improvements**

*20 responses*

* "space for dependent mother information"

* "A space like this one to leave a comment I put 0 as a dependent because my wife is in a nursing home permanently. Thank you"

* "cars and home on the same line regarding asset and expense. i got a little confused entering the information twice, one for each section."

* “Asking about the assets made it look like I have a lot, but they are still owed. Ex. Asset questions just ask about asset or the amount of the house we own. However, it didn't clarify that I still owe those mortgage amount. It might just be me, but I was confused."

* "Do assets include things that you still owe money on? I'm a bit unclear on that."

* "There is a cap of 12k"

* "Debts per month. So you folks can see why help is needed. After bills are paid there isn't much left."

* "Clarify "Own a home or Own a car'. Most are making payments such as a mortgage on a home, which does not qualify as 'ownership' until it is paid off. Maybe consider rewording."

* "For monthly mortgage payment, I would specify to Veterans to not to include HOA dues in the monthly mortgage amount. Including this will mitigate the need for Veterans to click the back button to adjust their mortgage amount."

* "I was not sure if my SSDI and SSI is supposed to be reported under income, but after looking it up online it became clear that they are to be ommited."

* "There should be a section to upload supporting documents. If you choose to."

* "VA Waiver should last a few years. Hard to go thru this long form. More streamlining. I thank the VA for helping me live longer with better quality of life. I support the VA for excellence in providing Healthcare."

* "You people don't even spell my name correctly.I have filled out the form 3 times to have this corrected and about to do it again.I am asking for a total write off.Its all I can do to survive."


#### **Status**
* “This is the second time I filled out this form. I never heard anything back from the first one. Can someone please let me know if you get this form that I filled out online for my Debit Relief?"

* "THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT IT TAKES SO LONG TO FIND OUT IF IT WAS APPROVED. WHEN YOU APPLY FOR RELIEF BEFORE THE DEAD LINE YOU STILL GET YOUR PENSION CHECK SHORTED BY THE AMOUNT OF RELIEF YOU ARE REQUESTING AND THEN WHEN IT IT IS GRANTED, I STILLDO NOT GET WHAT WAS TAKE ON THE SAME BILL THAT WAS APPROVED FOR RELIEF. THIS HAS HAPPENED TWICE TO ME AND WHEN I CALL TO GET RETURN OF FUNDS I AM TOLD TOO BAD CANT GIVE MONEY BACK EVEN THOUGH THE WAIVER WAS APPROVED FOR THE AMOUNT THAT WAS TAKEN OUT OF MY CHECK."

* "I've submitted for this before, but didn't get any response by mail. Emailed or text responses would be better."

* "I submitted this form for the second time now but I have not received any correspondence for it. I have only been told that my debt is nearing submission to the Department of treasury. Something that can confirm that the information was received and responded to."

* "Ask user about options for repayment"

* "It is difficult to provide a monthly expense for utilities. I had to analyze and average the payments."

### Not aware of the form
*3 responses*
* "It was pretty straightforward. I just wish I would have found this sooner."

* "finding the form, being aware it exists is difficult at best. The ID me/ mfa is more hassle than its worth and adds another layer of confusion and another system to fail or trouble shoot. evrything seems streamlined and taylored to discourage use."

* "wish I knew about this possible benefit earlier. I think I have been turned into collections in the past. VA care has been very good to me."


### **4\. I would recommend completing this form online instead of paper to another Veteran**
