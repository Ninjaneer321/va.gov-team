# Monthly Medallia Report: February 2025

With the addition of Custom Survey dataset shares since December 2024, the team is segmenting future monthly reports by survey for additional clarity by survey and by product. 

# FSR Custom Survey 

The FSR custom survey appears on the confirmation page of the [Financial Status Report (5655)](http://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction). To access this survey, users click on a modal button that asks for feedback towards the top of the page to launch the survey. All responses are optional, there are no required questions so users can decide on their own which questions to respond to. 

In reporting spreadsheets, this survey is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

Only appears on the FSR confirmation page (blue button > modal)  
At the end of the form after confirmation or approval message (positive), less of a negative response bias

**39 Qualitative Responses total**

### None, no suggestions

8 Responses

Responses included "None" and "N/A".

### Suggestions for Improvement, FSR Form-specific: 

**Difficulty providing marital info (a finding in the previous month as well)**

N = 2 

> I am married but we live separately and do not talk there was no place for me to enter that information

> Ask if veteran is separated from spouse

**An explanation box**

N = 3

> Include reason for debt to explain circumstances, such as errors in billing MST related medications.

> Comment box for explaining circumstances

> More boxes to have a real explanation.


**Option to request multiple relief options (to show willingness to pay something: a recurring theme in user research and in line with persona/archetype)**

N = 1

>Option to request both Relief options to show willingness to pay something


### Challenges: 

> I have submitted these forms multiple times and have never received a response.

N = 1


> Less evasive to help the veteran feel as though they really have some help in their trying situations.

N = 1

> Expense section does not come up online anymore.

N = 1


> I don't know exactly what the debt is for other than my daughter and her not in school at full time, she was 3/4. It would be nice to know what exactly the issue was but it won't matter because I'm broke regardless.

N = 1

## 4. I would recommend completing this form online instead of paper to another Veteran?
