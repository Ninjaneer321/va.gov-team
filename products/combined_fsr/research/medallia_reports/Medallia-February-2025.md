# Monthly Medallia Report: February 2025

With the addition of Custom Survey dataset shares since December 2024, the team is segmenting future monthly reports by survey for additional clarity by survey and by product. 

# FSR Custom Survey 

The FSR custom survey appears on the confirmation page of the [Financial Status Report (5655)](http://va.gov/manage-va-debt/request-debt-help-form-5655/introduction). To access this survey, users click on a modal button that asks for feedback towards the top of the page to launch the survey. All responses are optional, there are no required questions so users can decide on their own which questions to respond to. 

In reporting spreadsheets, this survey is known as `VA.gov Debt Portal Questionnaire`.

Only appears on the FSR confirmation page (blue button > modal)  
At the end of the form after confirmation or approval message (positive), less of a negative response bias

## Please rate your experience with VA.gov today

**31 Responses**
**Mean: 2.67**
**Mode: 5**



## Why did you select that rating? 


**Service Design Issues**

**Unable to check status**

I have paid on one of the prescription bills but it was not listed.  I found I needed another authentication way, but already have one. I have been trying for a month to get the ratings listing for both my husband, a vet, and myself and the website is always down.  So there is no way to check our statuses.


**Taking too long for dependency claim.**

# VA.gov VFS Questionnaire (blue button 'provide feedback' > self initiated)

Appears on all VA.gov pages (blue button feedback)

## What is your overall satisfaction with this site?


**64 Responses**
**Mean: 2.04**
**Mode: 1**


## What task were you trying to do today?


**Service design issues**

N = 5

>send VA copies of my orders to active duty to suspend my va comp payments.

>I just contacted the VA financial services regarding my medical copayment. The staff refuses to answer me on why the extra questions when identifying myself over the phone. The 1st two representatives were unprofessional. Is this what going back to the office looks like now for us Veterans?

>I'm told I have a debt, but I'm also believe in owed for back pay to last year for 3 dependents. I'm requesting a review of this situation please.


**Payment history lacking, timing discrepancy, cannot verify payment went through**

N = 11

>Tried to pay $15 charge and it looked like it went through "maybe" but now I look back in at my account after having to log back in and there is no sign the payment was applied.  Will check back in a day or two and keep an eye on my card account.  This is all a muddled mess that made me burn through ~5 of the backup codes for logins and wasted my time it seems...

>Verify my copay. I always pay my copay bill right away, and it always is wrong when I look it up! One time I paid the bill thinking the web site was correct and it was not and the money was refunded. Why is this so hard to keep current?

>Contest my copay that has already been paid on 25 February 2025! I have the damn receipt and I have signed up for the payment record keeping site! 


**Paying multiple times**

N  = 2


**Wanting to see past statements**

N = 1

>Please provide an easy link to locate and download past statements.

**New login difficulty**

N = 2
