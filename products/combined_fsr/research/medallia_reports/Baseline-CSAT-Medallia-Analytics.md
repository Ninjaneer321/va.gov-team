## CSAT Baseline Calculations for Financial Management VA Pages (Manage-VA-Debt)


Defining a meaningful baseline for a Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score requires analyzing historical trends and identifying a stable reference point that accounts for natural fluctuations. 
1. Analyze Historical Data

- Calculated the average CSAT for each year and the overall baseline weighted average.

Next steps: 

- Asses trends—is CSAT improving, declining, or stable?
- Check for seasonality—are there recurring dips or peaks in satisfaction?

2. Determine a Meaningful Baseline

**The baseline CSAT scores have been defined based on yearly CSAT scores for years 2023, 2024, and 2025 to date (March 2025).**

***The formula is:***

> Baseline CSAT= [(CSAT2023​×N2023​)+(CSAT2024​×N2024​)+(CSAT2025​×N2025​)​] / N2023​+N2024​+N2025​

***Where:*** 

-   CSATyear​  = Customer Satisfaction Score for that year (in percentage)
    
-   NyearNyear​  = Sample size (number of responses) for that year
