Open text field provided.

**57 Qualitative Responses total**

N = 13

### Positive feedback left

N = 9

Example quotes: 

> I thought is was quite easy. [State specified] unemployment could definitly take advice on how to take car of a website. 2 1/2 applying for unemployment yesterday

> This was super simple to complete

> The form was simple to fill out.  My wife and I have not seen each other since October of 2016 and we do not share money or bills.  She has her own and I have my own.

> I think the firm is very easy to understand and accessible. It is also short. I donâ€™t think it needs changing.

> Great interactive (for me) form. Very easy to use

> First time using this it would not be fair to leave feedback at this point

### Top of mind concerns

> On all of the information I received prior to filing out the form, as well as on the first (but not second part) of the form today, it said that I had until May 27th, 2025 to submit. When actually going through, the date a few screens past it (don't remember the exact amount) said April 27th, 2025! Alarming. I have screenshots if you want to see.

N = 1

### Notable feedback to make expenses section more all encompassing 

> Asking the ages of dependents if you have over 5. Sometimes forget an age or two and have to go check to make sure youâ€™re correct. The expenses part, well itâ€™s so much more than just whatâ€™s asked that taking care of a family has to handle. For example I donâ€™t have a car right now. I use uber everywhere. Kids birthdays and vacations and trips for the kids. Everything costs.

> I feel it asks you about expenses but doesn't necessarily cover all expenses. Should be a section for all other expenses and a spot to list them.

> How about monthly bills, they should be here too.

> When it asks about expenses, I wasnâ€™t very sure where to put my car insurance, phone bill, internet because those are a monthly payment and thought they would go with contracted paymentsâ€¦ but then some of those things were listed as personal expensesâ€¦. So I added them to both. So that part was a bit unclear.

> there were no question give to cost of living.  Like rent. utilities & food

N = 5

### Needing guidance on best relief or help option

> To find out this relief from payment is available.

> Unsure which initial option to choose

N = 2

### Service design feedback 

About timeliness of form processing: (N = 2)

> There's no sense in having this form if you can't process it before it's deducted from our disability compensation. Really, I would like someone to explain to me how this form helps veterans in any way.

> I've been approved for debt forgiveness but I don't see the balance I owe showing zero.

About including other debts:

> This does NOT include fill ins for other debts... NOT an all encompassing form. Last night the site crashed & wouldn't let me submit.

About wanting to include financial hardship info and personal issues:

> I wish there was a place to add financial hardship info. and personal issues such as death of a spouse.

Misc:

> HOLD THE VA EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR MISTAKES/INTENTIONAL ABUSES OF VETERANS, such as was done to me.

N = 4

### Notable feedback about optimizing UX efficiency on form, navigation, and findability of the form

> A quick link for each section would be helpful to avoid having to use the on-screen back button. The review contained a quick link for all sections. Perhaps include this throughout the form. I was initially unsure where to put my home loan and tractor loan. I finally figured it out. Otherwise, the form was very easy to understand and complete.

> It was very hard to find the form and then it confusing to find it again. I almost gave up on it. (lines 145 of spreadsheet)

> A navigation bar or tabs would be useful when going thru the review.  Currently you have to click "continue" when it takes you back to a section to edit upon review.

> It's a bit challenging to actually get to this page.

N = 4

### Marriage options (recurring theme in previous monthly reports)

> My Wife Social Security shouldn't be held against me since we are separated. When you are asked if you are married you should have an option to state Separated.

> ASK YOUR MARRIED STATUS IF YOU ARE SEPARATED FROM YOUR WIFE. IF SEPARATED YOUR WIFE INCOME IS NOT AVAILABLE TO YOUR SUPPORT
> Veteran information for spouse. There should be a space for those that are separated.

N = 3

### Uploading supporting documents (uplading documents to forms is a theme we heard in the most recent study as of June 2025)

> Perhaps a way to upload supporting documents

N = 1 

### Notable feedback and ideas to streamline  

First name misspelling: 

> My middle name is spelt wrong in the system, itâ€™s spelt [omitted] in the system but itâ€™s actually spelt [omitted]

Requesting pre-filled information 

> basic information that almost certainly does not change from previous completions was not automatically inserted or simply asked for verification: married with children is expected to change on a frequency of 13-18 years according to 2018 length of marriage data.

N = 2

### Misc

(lines 100 and 130 of spreadsheet)

> The information I entered was not reflected correctly on the completed form

> This is the 3rd time filling it out with no responses 

N = 1

## 4. I would recommend completing this form online instead of paper to another Veteran?
