# Medication Review - Proposed Language

The medication review language will appear on most (possibly all) scheduled appointments. It should be short, to the point,and easy to scan.

## Rough draft

**Prepare for your visit**  

Bring a list of all the medications, vitamins, herbs, and supplements you're taking â€” no matter if you got them from another provider, VA clinic, or local store. 

Tell your provider:

* About any recent changes in any medications you take. 
* Any changes to the the effects they have had on you.
* If you have a drug allergy.
