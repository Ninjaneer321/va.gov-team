# Medication Review - Proposed Language

## First draft

**Medication review**  

During your appointment, be ready to talk about your medications. Your provider will want to review all the medications, vitamins, herbs, and supplements you're taking â€” no matter if you got them from another provider, VA clinic, or local store. 

Also tell the doctor about any recent changes in any medications you take or the effects they have had on you.
