The medication review language will appear on most (possibly all) scheduled appointments. It should be short, to the point,and easy to scan.

## Rough draft - 05/08/2024

**Prepare for your appointment**

Bring a list of all the medications you're taking, including these types:

- Prescriptions from VA and non-VA providers
- Over-the-counter medications
- Vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies

Include the doses (amounts) you take and how often you take them.

Tell your provider about these things:

- Changes in the medications you're taking
- Changes in how your medications affect you
- Allergies or reactions you have to medications (also called adverse drug reactions)
- Other health care you're receiving from other VA facilities or from providers outside VA
