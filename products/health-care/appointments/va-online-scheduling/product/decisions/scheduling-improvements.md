# Appointments Tool on VA.gov - Scheduling Improvements

## Objective
The Appointments team is looking for ways to improve the tool to help the Veteran navigate the tool easily. The user should have a positive experience when they are scheduling, requesting and managing their appointments online. 

## Notes

Recap from Feasibility meeting
Irrelevant locations:
Kay asked, will the list of relevant locations include CC? Yes, if they are eligible.
List can be based on drive time to nearest VA from address on file
We should explore what personalization might look like
Surfacing Availability:
We might be able to see more available options in the future such as phone or video appointments.
Oracle Health Scheduling:
Non-negotiable: PID
Kay asked how can we get more care types added and then when they are added how do we handle the Veteran navigating a really long list of care types?
We should explore chat options for scheduling
Direct scheduling for Community Care:
How can we make referrals part of the scheduling process
We will need to work with IVC to understand what is already being done for CC scheduling.
Prioritization:
#1 OH #2 Irrelevant locations and or CC. #3 Availability
