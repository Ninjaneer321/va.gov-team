| RCI<br/><br/> | In the Veterans Affairs (VA) community care referral process, the "RCI" typically stands for the "Referral Coordination Initiative." This group is responsible for managing and coordinating the referral of veterans to community care providers. They ensure that the referrals are appropriately processed, veterans receive the necessary authorizations, and the care is timely and meets the veterans' healthcare needs. The RCI team works closely with various stakeholders, including VA medical centers, community providers, and veterans, to streamline the referral process and improve access to care.<br/><br/> |
