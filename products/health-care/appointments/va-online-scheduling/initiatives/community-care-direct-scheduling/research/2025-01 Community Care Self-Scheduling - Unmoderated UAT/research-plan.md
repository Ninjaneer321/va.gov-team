# Research Plan - Check in with an MSA after eCheck-in Unmoderated Survey

## Background


This study aims to get Veteran feedback on the Community Care self-schedulng pilot process, which will inform future iterations ahead of releasing to more sites.

### OCTO Priorities
The Community Care Self-Scheduling initiative aligns with the following OCTO-DE Priorities:
- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
This research corresponds to the following points of the Veteran journey:
- Taking care of myself

## Research Goals

### Outcome
This study will give us insight into if Veterans notice and understand the information added to the Check-in flow around seeing a staff member after completing eCheck-in, as well as gauge Veterans reactions to this new step in the process.

### Research Questions
- What do Veterans value most about online check-in?



### Hypotheses
- What do Veterans value most about online check-in?


## Method
This research will be conducted as an unmoderated survey study using Optimal Workshop. To recruit Veterans from the pilot sites, we will add information and a link on the confirmation page of the Community Care Self-Scheduling flow. This will lead to a tailored Perigean registration form so Perigean can easily identify the participants are looking to complete our UAT survey.

### Location
Once recruited tests will be conducted online at the participant’s leisure.
