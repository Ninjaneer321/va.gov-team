# Research Findings - Community Care Self-Scheduling
_[DRAFT]_

## Key Findings

### Referrals
- What terms do Veterans use to describe the process of receiving authorization from VA to schedule an appointment with a community care provider? 
  - **[Finding # 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-1):** One third of participants, without moderator prompts, identified the process or document received when VA has approved care by a community care provider as a “referral,” while others used different terms such as consult, request, authorization, or were not sure what term to use.

- Where do Veterans expect to find new referrals that are waiting to be self-scheduled?
  - **[Finding # 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-2):** Before concept testing, participants expected to find new referrals in Appointments on va.gov or within My HealtheVet, with more participants indicating they’d look in My HealtheVet.
- Where do Veterans expect to find their past referrals?
  - **[Finding # 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-3):** Before concept testing, participants weren’t confident in where they expected to find past referrals, but mentioned both Appointments and Medical Records.
- **Concept testing:** How do the concepts presented in the prototype address or not address Veterans’ expectations around referrals?
  - **[Finding # 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-4):** Slightly less than half of participants were able to find a link to navigate to review all of their referrals in the prototype, but the majority of participants were able to identify where to look for older referrals. 

### Self-scheduling user flow
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to start the scheduling process from a text message and a task card component on the Appointments landing page?
  - **[Finding # 5](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/community-care-direct-scheduling/research/2024-06%20Community%20Care%20Self-Scheduling%20-%20Usability%20and%20Concept%20Testing/research-findings.md#finding-5):** The majority of participants were able to easily start the scheduling process from the Appointments list task card, while 2 participants selected the incorrect link.

- Do Veterans find the referral expiration date helpful? 
  - **[Finding # 6](link):** The majority of participants noticed the expiration date of the referral and found the presence of this information helpful, but many found the expiration date used in the prototype (e.g., 310 days) and wording to be confusing or misleading.
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to schedule their community care appointments using the prototype?
  - **[Finding #7](link):** Participants were able to easily navigate the scheduling process and complete all tasks, but did run into challenges at two points. In addition, many participants offered unprompted positive feedback around the tool.
- Do Veterans understand the information and what to do next on the referral introduction page?
  - **[Finding # 8](link):** Participants understood the information on the referral introduction page as a whole, but had some questions and suggestions for additional information. All participants were able to easily find the "schedule appointment" call to action.
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the right provider using the filter and sort?
  - **[Finding # 9](link):** The filter pattern did not present any usability concerns, but our results lacked conclusive evidence that Veterans would use the feature prior to prompting them to use it. Though participants said the filters met overall expectations, some called out specific filters as confusing or missing. 
- Do Veterans expect to find providers in this tool that DO NOT offer online scheduling (e.g., schedule by phone)?
  - **[Finding # 10](link):** Of the four participants we had time to ask, all four understood the "online scheduling" filter and found it beneficial. However, participants also expected to find providers that didn’t offer online scheduling and told us they would call and schedule with those providers, if needed. 
- Would Veterans expect that they’d have to call the community care provider or VA to let them know they canceled a scheduled community care appointment?
  - **[Finding # 11](link):** Participants knew how to cancel their appointments in the prototype and understood there was no reason to take an additional step to call. Although 1 participant still said they’d call the office after canceling to make sure it had worked.
 
### Expectations for VA staff follow up
- Would Veterans expect VA to contact them if they hadn't self-scheduled their referral in a certain amount of time? If so, in how many days? 

   - **[Finding # 12](link):** The majority of participants said they would expect VA to contact them if they haven't self-scheduled their appointment within a certain amount of time.
 

## Details of Findings

### Referrals

#### Finding #1: 

**One third of participants, without moderator prompts, identified the process or document received when VA has approved care by a community care provider as a “referral,” while others used different terms such as consult, request, authorization, or were not sure what term to use.**

- 5 of 15 participants identified an approved consult as a referral during contextual inquiries, compared to 10 of 15 participants named it something else or did not have a confident response.

> P2: "VA told me to standby and they would send the referral in. And then a day or two after that the community care provider called me."

> P16: "I put in the request through my primary care physician, but then someone from my VA home base called me back. They gave me some choices of who to go to."

> P3: "I sent a secure message to my primary - 'I need a consult for endocrinology for this date, this location, this doctor for my follow-up. They forward it to CC and hopefully it gets done because I already have the appointment.'"

> P12: "You have to tell your provider and they will send it to somebody for authorization and then they call you and they set up appointments."

#### Finding #2: 

**Before concept testing, participants expected to find new referrals in Appointments on va.gov or within My HealtheVet, with more participants indicating they’d look in My HealtheVet.**

- When asked where Veterans might expect to find new referrals waiting to be self-scheduled online, 2/8 participants said they’d go to Appointments on VA.gov and 5/8 participants said they’d go to My HealtheVet, with 1 of these 5 participants saying they’d then go to Appointments to schedule their appointment. 1 participant said he’d have his wife take care of it and wasn’t sure where she’d navigate.

> P17: "I would see if there's a link for referrals [on the Appointments page to find other referrals that need to be scheduled]. Referral would be the only way I know. Referrals or referrals to be scheduled."

> P5: "Probably in My HealtheVet [is where I would navigate to find a referral]. I typically look at my Blue Button to make sure my [provider] notes are correct and the appointment information is correct."

#### Finding #3: 

**Before concept testing, participants weren’t confident in where they expected to find past referrals, but mentioned both Appointments and Medical Records.**

- To locate past referrals, 1 participant said they'd go to their Health tab and navigate to either Appointments or Medical Records, 2 participants would go to their past Appointments on VA.gov, and 2 participants didn’t know where they'd navigate.

> P6: "Well I’m guessing it would be somewhere under health, health records."

> P2: "Definitely would go to my appointments and see if past authorizations are there."

> P7: "I really wouldn't know where to find that for community care appointments. I’m really not sure, to be honest with you."

#### Finding #4: 

**Slightly less than half of participants were able to find a link to navigate to review all of their referrals in the prototype, but the majority of participants were able to identify where to look for older referrals.** 

- 5 of 11 participants navigated to the Pending appointments tab to find approved referrals that needed to be self-scheduled (either on their own without moderator cues or with some help), while 6 of 11 participants did not consider navigating to the Pending appointments tab or needed significant cues to get there.

> P19: "It would be in Pending, wouldn't it? That's good! I like that."

- Other responses included:
  - **Select 'Start scheduling' (3 participants)** - _**P1:** "I would expect to just hit start scheduling [to start scheduling another approved referral] if I know I have a referral to start scheduling, that's where I would go."_
  - **Check for a task card (2 participants)** - _**P2:** "I always look at the stuff on top [of the page] for the things you still have to deal with [as far as  another referral needing to be scheduled]."_
  - **Check for a new text (1 participant)** - _**P4:** "I guess I'd go back to my text messages. I'd go click on the link again and I'd come back to this website."_

-
- 5 of 8 participants said they would select the the Past appointments tab to find referrals for their past appointments, while 2 participants could not complete this task or were not sure.

> P5: "[If I wanted to review older referrals from past appointments,] I would go to my past appointments because it should show the appointment and then I should be able to get the details about that."

### Self-scheduling user flow

#### Finding 5: 

**The majority of participants were able to easily start the scheduling process from the Appointments list task card, while 2 participants selected the incorrect link.**

- 13 of 15 participants were able to easily find the action link on the Appointments page to start scheduling their referral, while 2 participants would have selected the incorrect “Start scheduling” call to action. 5 participants cited confusion between the two similar links to start scheduling, with 2 participants describing the links as going to the same place.
> P2: "Start scheduling is right in front of me. Looks like I could select schedule your appointment or start scheduling."
> P4: "I would think that both of them go to the same spot, it's just a matter of the green one is to get your attention. It just prefers that you probably click on the green one, otherwise I think that both start scheduling and schedule your appointment are the same website as far as I know."

<img width="700" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 4 34 56 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f44708c5-1fea-4650-9c04-6d6b6f80b865">


#### Finding 6: 

**The majority of participants noticed the expiration date of the referral and found the presence of this information helpful, but many found the expiration date used in the prototype (e.g., 310 days) and wording to be confusing or misleading.**

- 13 of 14 participants noticed the referral expiration without prompts from the moderator, while 1 needed a small cue to notice it. 

- 8 participants cited confusion around wording or expiration length.
> P14: "I'd recommend putting something like referral expires in 310 days [for the tag] because I don't know what expires in 310 days. It says you can schedule your appointment now. So, there's nothing to me that explains what expires." 

- 2 participants felt a long expiration date was misleading or a sign of slow care from VA.
> P4: "I think that's pretty awesome that you get 310 days, but I also really would not know why anybody would get 310 days because that also gets a little frustrating. Because then you get along the lines of one of the issues at VA is it takes so long to get seen, so I really don't want to get 310 days. I'd rather get 30 days or 90 days in which the doctor's going to see me within a smaller window. If I'm coming in with a complaint, I'm coming in with a pain, I'm coming in with an issue, I want to get seen as soon as I can.

#### Finding 7: 

**Participants were able to easily navigate the scheduling process and complete all tasks, but did run into challenges at two points. In addition, many participants offered unprompted positive feedback around the tool.**

- **Challenges:**
  - The filter tasks proved challenging for some participants, with 9 of 15 participants noticing the sort and filter link without help from the moderator.
  - Though 12 of 13 participants were able to find the call to action to review a provider's availability, 1 screen reader user (using JAWS) had significant challenges navigating the provider list page and was unable to move forward to the next step. They expected the "next available" appointment to be something that they could select, and then choose a time.
> P13: "I want to see her on July 26. I'd want to select it [next available]." That's the confusing part because now it's telling me review available appointments. I need to know the time I can see her."

- 6 participants had unprompted positive feedback when asked if they had other questions or comments.
> P5: "Everything is pretty straightforward. I think it will be a very helpful tool and it will streamline the process. It will make things easier for our providers, but also for the Veteran as well, so we're not waiting so long."
> P17: "This would make life a lot easier compared to sitting on hold with the VA. Sometimes the community care provider won't call you back and you're just waiting and waiting."

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 4 39 19 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6224ef1-61ce-48f7-ad5c-1ed3357d5b09">


#### Finding 8: 

**Participants understood the information on the referral introduction page as a whole, but had some questions and suggestions for additional information. All participants were able to easily find the "schedule appointment" call to action.**

- 13/14 participants understood the information on the referral page and knew how to continue with scheduling their appointment, although 1 screen reader participant mentioned confusion and had suggestions for content changes around the expiration date and referral number.
> P13: "What do you mean expiration date? Does the referral expire in 30 days? I don't understand. Say 'your referral will expire in 30 days.'" Referral number: "What does that mean? I have no idea."

- 2 participants mentioned additional information they’d expect to find on the page, such as what type of services their appointment would include and what to do if, later on, they aren’t satisfied with their provider choice and want to change providers for a second opinion. 
> P19: "I would want to know, after so many appointments, what do I do if I'm not satisfied with that provider? ... How do I get a second opinion? Those are the things that I would want."

- 1 participant said the the format of the expiration date on the referral page was much easier to understand than the formatting on task card (on the subsequent page). 

- 2 participants interpreted “number of visits” as needing to complete 10 visits before the expiration date, 1 participant said they’d need to schedule 10 visits before that date, and 1 participant thought they already had 10 visits with this provider.
> P13: "When it says number of visits: 10. Are you saying the person has 10 visits or had 10 visits? I assume that the number of visits I (already) had with this person is 10. [I would suggest it reads,] you are approved for 10 visits"

#### Finding 9: 

**The filter pattern did not present any usability concerns, but our results lacked conclusive evidence that Veterans would use the feature prior to prompting them to use it. Though participants said the filters met overall expectations, some called out specific filters as confusing or missing.** 

- No concerns arose around the filter and sort page pattern and participants were able to select and apply filters very easily.

- 9 of 15 participants noticed the filter and sort link without help from the moderator when asked how they’d narrow down the list of providers. 4 participants found the filter and sort link only with moderator help, while 2 participants never noticed it or were not asked about it due to time. 

- 12 of 13 participants reported that the type of filters on the filter and sort page met their expectations, although 2 participants mentioned expecting a language filter and 1 of these participants suggested adding filters for religion and provider’s years practicing. 3 participants said they were unsure of what the practice filter meant before reviewing the field options.
> P13: "So you can select a practice meaning you can select from this menu of physicians. I think what you're trying to say is physical therapy or heart specialist."
> P6: "So that’s good, like I said I can pick a male or a female, but it doesn’t give you, like, languages. And for some people, maybe religion is a really big thing, though I don’t know why for a doctor. Maybe also how long has he or she has been a doctor."

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-27 at 4 44 04 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/578a3f8d-6134-44e0-a5e9-7401a1ded73c">

#### Finding 10: 

**Of the four participants we had time to ask, all four understood the "online scheduling" filter and found it beneficial. However, participants also expected to find providers that didn’t offer online scheduling and told us they would call and schedule with those providers, if needed.** 

- 4 of 4 participants, when prompted, said that the online scheduling filter was beneficial (e.g., a nice to have) when self-scheduling an appointment in this tool, and called out positives of this filter. 
> P5:  "Online scheduling, I like that. I get frustrated waiting on the phone and waiting on the phone tree to get to the scheduler and leave a message and never get a call back. So, I like the fact that you can filter for online scheduling." 

- However, participants told us they’d still expect to find providers who didn’t offer online scheduling in the provider list and would call and schedule with their provider of choice even if they didn’t offer online scheduling. 7 of 10 participants said it didn’t matter if the provider they wanted to schedule with offered online scheduling or not, while the remaining 3 participants said it’s circumstantial (e.g., urgency, how well they know the doctor they'd like to schedule with, etc.)
> P1: "Online scheduling is great, but I don't have a problem making a phone call to schedule an appointment."
> P7: "It would be nice to have it just as a point of  reference if I decided down along the road that I wanted to use a different person, different practitioner, and none of the ones with online scheduling met a requirement I was looking for, whether distance or whatever, it’s nice to know that someone without the online scheduling is available, I’d just have to make a phone call."

#### Finding 11: 

**Participants knew how to cancel their appointments in the prototype and understood there was no reason to take an additional step to call. Although 1 participant still said they’d call the office after canceling to make sure it had worked.**

## Recommendations

### Referrals
1. Continue to use "Referral" to identify this process and documentation (of receiving authorization from VA and scheduling an appointment with a community care provider), which had the higher number of mentions by participants. ([See Finding #_](link))

2. If new referrals are kept within the Pending page of the Appointments experience on VA.gov, like they were in the concept testing, consider changing the title of the page. Or consider adding a dedicated Referrals tab. ([See Finding #_](link))
3. Regardless of the link placement to navigate to referrals in the Appointments experience, work with staff to create messaging/scripting to point Veterans to the correct place on VA.gov when needed, or consider a short-term addition (such as a “did you know” highlight) that can call out this new feature. ([See Finding #_](link))
4. Consider including access to referrals in Medical Records, in addition to Appointments on VA.gov, particularly because past appointments disappear from the Appointments experience after 2 years. In Medical Records today, Veterans can access Non VA Care Consult Result Notes, but this doesn’t include the associated referral. ([See Finding #_](link))
5. When feasible, include links to referrals in individual past appointment detail pages (not MVP). ([See Finding #_](link))
