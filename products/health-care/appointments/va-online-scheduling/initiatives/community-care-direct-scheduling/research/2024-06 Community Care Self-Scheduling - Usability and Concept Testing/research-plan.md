# Community Care Self-Scheduling - Usability and Concept Testing
## Background
**The Cleland Dole Act** addresses Veteran homelessness, access to care, community care, mental health, research, telehealth, prostate cancer, provider oversight and transparency, long-term care, rural health, benefits, information technology and more. 

**Self-Scheduling and Community Care Self-scheduling Pilot Program**
- As a congressional mandate under the Cleland-Dole Act, VA must address the following for Veterans by the end of 2024:
Self-scheduling appointments
- Allows Veterans seeking for primary care, specialty care, and mental health care under the Veteran’s Community Care Program to self-schedule, modify, and cancel appointments directly online
- Allows VA to expand capabilities of an existing appointment self-scheduling technology or purchase a new appointment self-scheduling technology

**The pilot program MVP will allow Veterans at pilot sites in the Greater Los Angeles area to self-schedule physical therapy appointments using Appointments on va.gov once a referral is approved. They will also have the ability to cancel and reschedule those appointments.**


### OCTO Priorities
The Community Care Self-Scheduling feature aligns with the following OCTO-DE Priorities:
- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
This research corresponds to the following points of the Veteran journey:
- Taking care of myself

## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans on the CC appointment scheduling process and develop a better understanding of Veterans’ expectations around referrals. We also hope to evaluate reactions to initial concepts for referral locations. 

### Outcome
This study will give us insight into 
- if Veterans find it easy to schedule their community care appointments using the proposed scheduling process 
- where Veterans expect to find their new and past referrals, and what information they expect referrals to contain
- if our initial concepts for referral locations fit Veterans’ needs and expectations within the Appointments experience 

### Research Questions

#### Referrals
- What terms do Veterans use to describe the process of getting approved to schedule a community care appointment and then scheduling that appointment? Is referral the correct term to use for this process?
  
- **New referrals**
  - Where do Veterans expect to find their new referrals to schedule a related appointment?
  - What information are Veterans generally looking for in new referrals?
  - How do the concepts presented address or not address Veterans’ expectations around referrals?
  
- **Past referrals**
  - Where do Veterans expect to find information about past referrals?
  - What information are Veterans generally looking for in past referrals?
  - What, if anything, would Veterans use past referrals for?

#### Scheduling Flow
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to start the scheduling process via a text (or email) notification and Appointments list task card prompt?
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to schedule their community care appointments using the new CC scheduling flow?
  - **Referral page:** Do Veterans understand the information included on the Referral page and what it means for their scheduling options?
  - **Sort and filter:** How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to tailor their provider list via the filter/sort options?
  - **Review page:** Do Veterans understand the Review page information as it relates to their scheduling choices, and how to edit those choices?
- Do Veterans expect to find information in this tool for providers that DO NOT offer online scheduling (in order to schedule by phone)?
- What, if any, scheduling needs or preferences do Veterans have that are not currently addressed in the CC scheduling flow?

### Hypotheses
#### Referrals
- What terms do Veterans use to describe the process of getting approved to schedule a community care appointment and then scheduling that appointment? Is referral the correct term to use for this process? 
  - HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that Veterans use the term “referrals” when referring to community care requested and approved by VA.
- **New referrals**
  - Where do Veterans expect to find their new referrals to schedule a related appointment?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that Veterans expect to receive notifications about referrals and find their new/active referrals on the Appointment list, though we are not sure about the exact location.
  - What information are Veterans generally looking for in new referrals?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize Veterans will be looking for general referral information around type of care and number of visits approved, as well as information on the provider and location preferences they previously indicated.
  - How do the concepts presented address or not address Veterans’ expectations around referrals?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We expect that the concept presented (new referrals housed within Pending appointments) will not necessarily align with Veterans’ overall expectations around referrals.
- **Past referrals**
  - Where do Veterans expect to find information about past referrals?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We are not sure where Veterans expect to find information about past referrals, though we hypothesize they might expect them somewhere in either Appointments or medical records on MHV.
  - What information are Veterans generally looking for in past referrals?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize Veterans will be looking for general information around type of care, number of visits approved, and referring VA facility - possibly to obtain another referral of the same kind.
  - What, if anything, would Veterans use past referrals for?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We know Veterans need to be able to access referrals as part of their records, but are unsure of how they would use them.

#### Scheduling Flow
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to start the scheduling process via a text (or email) notification and Appointments list task card prompt?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that Veterans will find it easy to start the scheduling process via text or email notification, as the steps follow a similar process as other VA reminders and prompts.
- How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to schedule their community care appointments using the new CC scheduling flow?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We expect Veterans to be able to easily find a provider and schedule an appointment.
  - **Referral page:** Do Veterans understand the information included on the Referral page and what it means for their scheduling options?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We expect Veterans to understand the information included on their referral page but may not know what this information means for scheduling options until arriving on the provider list. 
  - **Sort and filter:** How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to tailor their provider list via the filter/sort options?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that Veterans will find it easy to use the sort/filter options, though they may not always notice the filter possibility without prompting.
  - **Review page:** Do Veterans understand the Review page information as it relates to their scheduling choices, and how to edit those choices?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that Veterans will understand the information on the Review page and know how to edit their choices.
- Do Veterans expect to find information in this tool for providers that DO NOT offer online scheduling (in order to schedule by phone)?
  - HYPOTHESIS:We hypothesize that, even if they cannot select a date and time for the provider, Veterans expect to find information on all eligible providers they can choose from, regardless of if they need to schedule via phone.  
- What, if any, scheduling needs or preferences do Veterans have that are not currently addressed in the CC scheduling flow?
    - HYPOTHESIS: We anticipate that Veterans will expect more filtering options and additional provider information.

## Methodology

This research will be conducted as a moderated study using Zoom. After some initial questions, we will have participants go through a prototype (prototype 1) for the scheduling flow. The moderator will then show the participant another set of screens (prototype 2) and ask questions about them.

### Location
The study will be conducted online via Zoom.
