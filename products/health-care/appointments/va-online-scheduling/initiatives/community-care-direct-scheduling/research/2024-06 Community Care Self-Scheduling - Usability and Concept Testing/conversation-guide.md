## Intro - 5 minutes
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is here taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

- Today we're going to talk about receiving a referral for community care and self-scheduling an appointment. 

- Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes for AT users).** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers and we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to, and whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you'd like to stop the session or don't want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _If yes: Admit observers._
     - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov._ 
     - _Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth_
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be interactive, and some will not. And none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and may share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback.** We won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we’ll remove your face and name from any videos that we share. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
- _If yes:_ **Ok, once I start recording, I am going to once more confirm that you are okay with me recording this session.**
_*Start recording.*_
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm up questions - 3 minutes 
- Before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions:

- Have you used the Appointments tool on VA.gov to schedule and manage your health appointments before?

- What device are you using to join this session today?

- I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the url? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you.

_If the participant is using a screen reader:_
  - Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

_If the participant is using screen magnification:_
  - Are you using a screen magnification tool today? If so, what type? (For example, Zoom.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- Great. Thank you.

## Referral questions - 10 minutes
- We have a few different activities we’ll complete during this session. To start, I’ll ask you a few questions about receiving authorization from VA to receive care from another VA provider for specialty care or a community care provider.

- First off, have you received care from a community care provider before? (You don’t need to talk about what it was for.)
  - _If yes:_ Could you talk me through how you got that appointment scheduled?

  - _If no:_ No, problem. Have you ever received care from a VA provider that you needed VA's authorization for?
    - _If yes:_ How did you schedule that appointment?

  - _If no to all:_ If you wanted to receive care from a community care provider in the future, could you tell me how you would go about requesting to receive care from them?

- What documentation would you expect to receive from your VA provider to receive care by another provider?

- And, what information would you expect to be included in those documents?

- Where would you expect to be able to find those documents from VA if they required you to self-schedule an appointment?

- Where would you expect to find those documents from past requests?
   
-------

## Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

- Ok, thank you! So now I'll have you try a prototype for scheduling an appointment online with a community care providers - based on a community care request you recently made. 

- In the prototype, some things you’ll be able to select, while other things you won’t. None of your information is included, and this won’t affect your account or benefits in any way.

- Do you have any questions about that before we get started?

- Ok, I’m sending you the prototype link in the [chat/email]. 

_Send [Prototype link](LINK)_

- You can go ahead and select that link. And let me know when you have that open. 


```
   [If needed: Instructions for opening chat]

   - Ok. Now go ahead and tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap (or select) the screen a menu will appear at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) “Chat."
```


- Ok, now I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototype. Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today?
   - _If no:_ No problem. In that case, would you be able to describe to me what you are doing as you go through the prototype?
     - _(If still no, for non-screen reader users): Moderator can choose to share their own screen._ I'd like to try something else. I'll share my screen and control the prototype, but you can tell me what you would do next and I'll do that. How does that sound? _Skip to start of email._ 

- _If yes:_ Great. Now, if there’s any apps, web pages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now.


```
  [If needed: Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes]

   - So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.
   - Tap (or select) the screen anywhere.
   - And, as you tap the screen a menu will open at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you can’t find “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options.
   - And, when you find the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.
   - Then, tap (or select) "Screen."
   - Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast.”
   - Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen."
```

- Now, imagine you just received this text message from VA. 

- Go ahead and review it.

- Is there anything that's confusing about this information?

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in a text message like this?

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.

---

_**Participant is at mock sign in page:**_

- At this point you would sign in to va.gov, but go ahead and choose any option, since this is just a prototype representing sign in.


---

_**Participant is at Appointment list:**_

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Where were you expecting to end up?

  - _If needed:_
    - What did you expect to be on this page?
    - Is anything here confusing?

- What are the most important factors to you when choosing a provider, let's say to find a new primary care provider for routine care? 
  - (Provide examples if needed, but try not to (possibly leading): for example, their reputation, their distance to your home)

- And, what about if you're choosing a provider for specialty care? For example, you’re searching for an orthopedic specialist that can do total knee replacements. What would be the most important factors?

- Ok, thank you. Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next.

---

_**Participant is on provider page:**_ 
- Tell me about this page.

- _If preferred provider wasn't mentioned:_ What's your understanding of the box at the top of the page?
  
- And without doing anything, I'm curious -- from here, how would you continue through finding a provider if I wasn't guiding you?

- Ok thanks, and what would you do if you wanted to search for providers with specific criteria or availability?

- Go ahead and walk me through that.
  
  - _If needed:_
    - Did you notice any way to choose information about the provider?
    - Did you notice the link that says filter? Go ahead and click on that.

_**Participant is on filter page:**_ 

- Tell me about this page.
  - _If needed:_ Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?

[SHOW ONLY ONLINE SCHEDULING FILTER]

- _If online scheduling option was not mentioned:_ And what about the second kind of filter there, what does that mean to you?
 
- _If not yet mentioned:_ If the provider you were looking for did NOT have online scheduling, would you still expect to find information on that provider here? 
    - _If yes:_ What information would you expect?
    - _If not:_ Could you tell me more about that?
 
- And if the provider you wanted to schedule with didn't offer online scheduling, would that change your provider decision?

[GENERAL]

- And what about the rest of the filters here? Is there anything confusing about those?
  
- Is there anything missing you’d expect to find on this page?

- Ok, without doing anything yet, what would you do next on this page?

---

_**Participant is on 2nd provider page:**_
- Tell me about this page now.
  
- What's your understanding of the provider list now that you selected those filter choices?
  - _If needed:_ How has the page changed?
  - _If needed:_ How do you know that those choices were applied?

- And how does this match up to what you expected to find on this page?

## Task #2: Referral concept test - 5 minutes

- Thank you! I just have one more thing for you to review.
  
- Now I’ll have you go back to your list of appointments by selecting ____. _(guide them back if needed)_


_**Participant is on appointment list page (no task card):**_

- Earlier we talked about where you would expect to find your referrals. I’d like to get your feedback on an early concept for where those referrals might be located.  

- You mentioned _______. **_(RECAP where the participant expected to find referrals from earlier questions)_**. At this point, let's say you remembered that you also requested another referral, in addition to the one you just scheduled for. From here, where would you go to find that referral?

- And where would you go to review your older referrals?

- Ok, thank you. Now, I’ll have you navigate to your Pending appointments. 

---

_**Participant is on Pending page:**_

- Talk to me about this page and what’s included here.

- How is this similar to or different from what you expected to find?

## Post-Task Interview - 1-2 minutes
- Ok, thank you! That concludes that activity and is everything we need to go through today. Do you have any other questions for me or comments about what we’ve reviewed today?

- Do you have any questions for me or anything else you’d like to share?

## Thank you and Closing - 1 minute
- Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on this feature and make sure it really works for Veterans.

- Thanks! And lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans who might be interested in participating in future research studies as well.

- Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Exit strategies

### Sample exit strategies
We recommend you plan a graceful exit strategy that you will feel comfortable using during a session. Your goal is to simply wrap up the session without any further incident or escalation. It is important not to blame the participant, since it could increase any distress or trauma they are experiencing. If you are exiting for a reason on your side, it’s best not to share any personal details, as it may create additional stress for all. Examples of exit strategies that have worked include:

- **Out of questions:** "We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback."

- **Blame technology:** "I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time."

- **Backup Moderator:** This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
