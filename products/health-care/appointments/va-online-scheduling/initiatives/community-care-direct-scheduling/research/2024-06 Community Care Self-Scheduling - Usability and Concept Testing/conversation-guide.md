## Intro - 5 minutes
- Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is here taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

- Today we're going to talk about receiving a referral for community care and self-scheduling an appointment. 

- Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes for AT users).** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers and we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to, and whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you'd like to stop the session or don't want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Just let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _If yes: Admit observers._
     - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov._ 
     - _Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth_
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be interactive, and some will not. And none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- **We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and may share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback.** We won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we’ll remove your face and name from any videos that we share. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
- _If yes:_ **Ok, once I start recording, I am going to once more confirm that you are okay with me recording this session.**
_*Start recording.*_
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm up questions - 3 minutes 
- Before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions:

- Have you used the Appointments tool on VA.gov to schedule and manage your health appointments before?

- What device are you using to join this session today?

- I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the url? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you.

- _If the participant is using a screen reader:_
  - Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- _If the participant is using screen magnification:_
  - Are you using a screen magnification tool today? If so, what type? (For example, Zoom.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?

- Great. Thank you.

---
## Referral questions - 10 minutes
- We have a few different activities we’ll complete during this session. To start, I’ll ask you a few questions about getting authorization for a specialist appointment or community care.

- First off, have you received care from a community care provider before? You don’t need to talk about what it was for.
  - _If yes:_ Could you talk me through how you got that appointment scheduled?

  - _If no:_ No, problem. Have you ever received care from a VA specialist that you needed authorization for?
    - _If yes:_ How did you get that appointment set up?

  - _If no to all:_ If you needed to see a community care provider, how would you get approval for that appointment? (use specialty care if they don’t know)

- And what would you call these types of requests/authorizations? (OR How would you refer to the process of getting this type of appointment set up? / How would you refer to the thing you get from your provider that allows you to schedule this type of appointment?)

- If these (authorizations/approvals/referrals - whatever the participant calls referrals) were kept in a digital format somewhere for you,
  - Where would you expect to find new items you could schedule an appointment for?
    - And what information would you expect to be included?
  - Where would you expect to find older items?
    - And what information would you expect to be included?



- Ok, thanks. And if you could complete the scheduling process yourself online for a community care appointment, how would you expect to do that?
  - If needed: What would you expect that process to be like? Where would you go to do that?

## Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

- Ok, thank you! So now I'll have you try a prototype for filing a travel reimbursement claim where you or a caregiver drove your own vehicle, from your home address, directly to your medical appointment, and then back home. 

- In the prototype, some things you’ll be able to select, while other things you won’t. None of your information is included, and this won’t affect your account or benefits in any way.

- Do you have any questions about that before we get started?

- Ok, I’m sending you the prototype link in the [chat/email]. 

_Send [Prototype link](LINK)_

- You can go ahead and select that link. And let me know when you have that open. 


```
   [If needed: Instructions for opening chat]

   - Ok. Now go ahead and tap (or select) the screen anywhere. And, as you tap (or select) the screen a menu will appear at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) “Chat."
```


- Ok, now I’d like to be able to see your screen so I can see how you’re using the prototype. Are you comfortable sharing your screen with me today?
   - _If no:_ No problem. In that case, would you be able to describe to me what you are doing as you go through the prototype?
     - _(If still no, for non-screen reader users): Moderator can choose to share their own screen._ I'd like to try something else. I'll share my screen and control the prototype, but you can tell me what you would do next and I'll do that. How does that sound? _Skip to start of email._ 

- _If yes:_ Great. Now, if there’s any apps, web pages or notifications on your device that you’d like to close or turn off before I’m able to see your screen, I’ll give you a moment to do that now.


```
  [If needed: Screen Sharing Instructions - 2 Minutes]

   - So, now I’ll talk you through how to share your screen.
   - Tap (or select) the screen anywhere.
   - And, as you tap the screen a menu will open at the bottom of your screen.
   - In that menu, tap (or select) "Share." If you can’t find “Share” in that menu, you may need to tap the menu and drag it to the left to uncover more options.
   - And, when you find the “Share” option, go ahead and select it.
   - Then, tap (or select) "Screen."
   - Then, tap the words, “Start Broadcast.”
   - Now, tap (or select) anywhere on the paragraph at the top of the screen that starts with "Everything on your screen."
```

## Exit strategies

### Sample exit strategies
We recommend you plan a graceful exit strategy that you will feel comfortable using during a session. Your goal is to simply wrap up the session without any further incident or escalation. It is important not to blame the participant, since it could increase any distress or trauma they are experiencing. If you are exiting for a reason on your side, it’s best not to share any personal details, as it may create additional stress for all. Examples of exit strategies that have worked include:

- **Out of questions:** "We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback."

- **Blame technology:** "I am so sorry, but I just learned that the [website/prototype/thing I wanted to test with you today] is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time."

- **Backup Moderator:** This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session [backup moderator name] will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
