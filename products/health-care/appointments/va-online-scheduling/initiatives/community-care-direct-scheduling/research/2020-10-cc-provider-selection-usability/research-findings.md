key_findings:
  - "All participants wanted the list of providers to be more personalized. The top request was to be able to schedule with providers they have seen in the past, or a specific provider they had researched/heard about"
  - "For both cases, appointment availability was top of mind. Most participants wanted to know how soon they could see the provider, or if the provider was available on specific dates"
  - "Participants liked knowing a provider's distance, but some wanted to see the provider list in alphabetical order so they could find someone who they already knew - either an existing provider, or one they had researched"
  - "Most participants said they would spend time researching providers before reaching this step, googling review sites to get a sense of the provider's reputation"
recommendations:
  - "Consider researching a provider-first approach to the VAOS workflow that would support two paths for Veterans scheduling appointments; those who are returning to a provider, and those who want to find someone new"
  - "Let Veterans choose to make appointments based on those they have scheduled in the past, using the same provider and type of care"
  - "Validate that schedulers would be able to speed up the process of finding care if they had three provider options"
  - "Consider moving the calendar to later in the request process, or removing it entirely for community care appointment requests"

- Participants liked knowing a provider’s distance, but **some wanted to see the provider list in alphabetical order so they could find someone who they already knew - either an existing provider, or one they had researched.**
- **Most participants said they would spend time researching providers before reaching this step,** googling review sites to get a sense of the provider’s reputation.
