# EPS-VAOS (CC Direct Scheduling) Meeting Agenda 04-09-2024

## Authorized Referrals 

- Can VAOS team get a sample set of data from a complex and simple authorized referral (from Michael)?
- Who can the VAOS team get in touch with to start the integration with CCRA to retrieve authorized referral information?
- Does CCRA also have the authorized referral letters that we can access? (Or are those in a a different system?)

## CC Scheduling Access Standards

- Who can the VAOS team get in touch with to understand access standards (e.g., what's in Console Toolbox or other system) for scheduling with a CC provider? For example, calculating drive time. Is there a system in place? Do we need to replicate those rules on our own?
     - What other business rules or restrictions do we need to know about when enabling Veterans to self-schedule with CC providers?

## EPS & WellHive

- Where is VAOS writing the scheduled appointments back to? Into EPS? Or into EPS & WellHive? 
- Does EPS or WellHive need any other information about a booked appointment besides Veteran ID/ICN, CC provider name or NPI, day and time or appointment?
- Does VAOS need to collect and send any other information about the appointment or Veteran to either system? 

## Assumptions / Decisions 

- VAOS will likely integrate directly with PPMS to search and return CC providers in VAOS since that integration already exists.

## VHA / IVC Requirements

- Does the CC self-scheduling flow need to capture the Veterans preferred appointment date before scheduling begins, like VA Direct Scheduling?
