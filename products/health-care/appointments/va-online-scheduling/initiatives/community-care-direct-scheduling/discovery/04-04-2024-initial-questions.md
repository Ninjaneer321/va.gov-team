# ESP VAOS (or CC Direct Scheduling) Process Questions 

Date: April 3, 2024

- Where do we envision the CC Direct Scheduling experience *starting* for the Veteran? 
     - Option 1: Surfacing an approved referral where a Veteran can start scheduling from? If so, what system will provide that approved referral from? And, what information will be included? E.g., provider(s), care type, number of appointments, etc. 
     - Option 2: Or, would this process need to start with requesting a CC referral online? And, if so, how do we envision that Veterans would do that on VA.gov?   
- More broadly: 
     - What information exists in a CC referral? And, can you walk us through how a request, consult and referral relate to each other? 
     - Whatâ€™s the existing process and eligibility checks that VA staff complete today in order to approve a CC referral? Will that process be changing to support CC Direct Scheduling? 
- Could you walk us through (maybe by way of a demo) the steps that MSAs go through from receiving an approved CC referral to scheduling an appointment in the staff-facing EPS tool?  
- Has the DTC Integration Platform (DIP) already been integrated with EPS? 
- Do we envision removing the Request a CC Appointment tool in VAOS when we launch the CC Direct Scheduling pilot? Or, would those continue to coexist? 
- Does WellHive have any Veteran or consumer-facing provider scheduling directories (i.e., government or private sector) that offer a great user experience that we can reference when designing to fit within VAOS?
