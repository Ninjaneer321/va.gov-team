# Medication Wording 

#### Overview

## Outcome Summary

An OIG/Congressional request came in to add content helping Veterans understand how to review their medications ahead of an appointment to various points where Veterans encounter their appointments. The objective is to remind Veterans to be ready to talk about any medication, supplement, vitamins, etc that they have been prescribed or are taking from any provider, VA clinic, or local store. This initiative aims to improve communication and support veterans in managing their medication effectively.

## Problem

The problem were addressing is the need to improve medication-related communication with veterans across various channels. The challenge lies in ensuring that veterans are adequately informed and prepared to discuss their medications during their appointments.

The affected parties include:

- Veterans: They may face difficulties in remembering or accurately communicating their medications during appointments, which can impact the quality of their healthcare.
- Healthcare Providers: Inadequate information about a patient's medications can lead to potential errors in diagnosis, treatment, or medication management.
- Administrative Staff: They may encounter issues related to scheduling, reminders, and updating patient information across multiple platforms.

The evidence of this problem is evident from the congressional request, which indicates a need to add medication-related content to appointment notifications and detail pages across various channels.

This initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals by improving the quality of care for veterans and ensuring that their healthcare providers have accurate and comprehensive information about their medications.
