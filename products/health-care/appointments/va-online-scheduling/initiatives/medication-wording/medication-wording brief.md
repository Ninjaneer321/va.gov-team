## Problem
The problem were addressing is the need to improve medication-related communication with veterans across various channels. The challenge lies in ensuring that veterans are adequately informed and prepared to discuss their medications during their appointments.

The affected parties include:

Veterans: They may face difficulties in remembering or accurately communicating their medications during appointments, which can impact the quality of their healthcare.
Healthcare Providers: Inadequate information about a patient's medications can lead to potential errors in diagnosis, treatment, or medication management.
Administrative Staff: They may encounter issues related to scheduling, reminders, and updating patient information across multiple platforms.
The evidence of this problem is evident from the request you received, indicating a need to add medication-related content to appointment notifications and detail pages across various channels.

This initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals by improving the quality of care for veterans and ensuring that their healthcare providers have accurate and comprehensive information about their medications.
