# Medication Wording 
#### Overview

<details>
 
 *There is roughly a 1:many relationship between products and initiatives, or our attempts to improve a product/achieve Veteran outcomes. The same goes for product outlines and initiative briefs. This template can be used as product documentation for the Collaboration Cycle, especially when iterating an existing product. In addition, the Brief is an important communication tool within a team and between the team and Crew Chief/PO/other teams.*

## Outcome Summary
We had an OIG/Congressional request come in to add some medication-related content to appointment notifications and detail pages for all appointment types on all channels. The objective is to remind Veterans to be ready to talk about any medication, supplement, vitamins, etc that they have been prescribed or are taking from any provider, VA clinic, or local store.

- My VA Health portals

## Problem
The problem were addressing is the need to improve medication-related communication with veterans across various channels. The challenge lies in ensuring that veterans are adequately informed and prepared to discuss their medications during their appointments.

The affected parties include:

Veterans: They may face difficulties in remembering or accurately communicating their medications during appointments, which can impact the quality of their healthcare.
Healthcare Providers: Inadequate information about a patient's medications can lead to potential errors in diagnosis, treatment, or medication management.
Administrative Staff: They may encounter issues related to scheduling, reminders, and updating patient information across multiple platforms.
The evidence of this problem is evident from the request you received, indicating a need to add medication-related content to appointment notifications and detail pages across various channels.

This initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals by improving the quality of care for veterans and ensuring that their healthcare providers have accurate and comprehensive information about their medications.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it):
