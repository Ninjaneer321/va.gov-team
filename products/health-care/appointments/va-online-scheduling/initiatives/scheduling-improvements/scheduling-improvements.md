### Feasibility meeting notes  

<details>
<summary>February 15, 2024</summary>

- **Irrelevant locations**: Kay asked, will the list of relevant locations include CC? Yes, if they are eligible. List can be based on drive time to nearest VA from address on file. We should explore what personalization might look like 
- **Surfacing Availability:** We might be able to see more available options in the future such as phone or video appointments. - Oracle Health Scheduling: Non-negotiable: PID. Kay asked how can we get more care types added and then when they are added how do we handle the Veteran navigating a really long list of care types? We should explore chat options for scheduling
- **Direct scheduling for Community Care:** How can we make referrals part of the scheduling process. We will need to work with IVC to understand what is already being done for CC scheduling.
- **Prioritization:** #1 OH #2 Irrelevant locations and or CC. #3 Availability

### CES Metting notes
<details>
<summary>February 22, 2024</summary>

In regards to our CES call today about Community Care appointments in Oracle Health, per Anthony Pilozzi, they are sending appointments recorded ini HSRM back to Cerner (aka Oracle Health). If we can distinguish Community Care appointments from VA appointments in Oracle Health we could just filter out those appointments so they aren't displayed to the Veteran.bility
