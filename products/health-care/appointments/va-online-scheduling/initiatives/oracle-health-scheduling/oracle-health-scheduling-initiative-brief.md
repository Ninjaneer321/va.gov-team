# Initiative Brief - Oracle Health Scheduling

## Overview

The Appointments tool on VA.gov will need to support online scheduling for Oracle Health. The goal is to sunset the current My VA Health portal and have users use the MHV on VA.gov tool to schedule and manage their appointments.
 
---

## Outcome Summary

A user can view their appointments (upcoming, pending, canceled or past), book an appointment and submit request an appointment at an Oracle Health site.

## Measuring Success

- Success will be measured by the increased number of veterans using VAOS instead of MHV
- Will look at these specific measurements:
  - Number of unique users of VAOS
  - Number of pageviews of appointment list page
  - No increase in average response time of appointment list page
  - Decrease in the number of errors when fetching appointment data (desired)

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The experience may vary based on the data we have for the appointment type
  - If user is unable to find any value in VAOS, they may lose trust in the application and are less likely to return
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - We will have to balance between showing the right amount of information in the appointment list 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Must work with our engineers to see what available data we can use to enhance the appointment details 
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
