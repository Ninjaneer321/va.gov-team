# Initiative Brief - Oracle Health Scheduling

## Overview

The Appointments tool on VA.gov will need to support online scheduling for Oracle Health. The goal is to sunset the current My VA Health portal and have users use the MHV on VA.gov tool to schedule and manage their appointments.
 
---

## Outcome Summary

A user can view their appointments (upcoming, pending, canceled or past), book an appointment and submit request an appointment at an Oracle Health site. 


**Related/Associated product(s)**
- Dependent on [VPG service launch](.md) rollout 

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
  - We would need to support the sites that have the Oracle Health system. The VA.gov Appointments tool does online shceduling for Vista system and HSRM for Community Care requests. This addition would be benefecial for Veterans who are registered at a Oracle Health site and would have the ability to use the new MHV on VA.gov application.  
  
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - Trying to unify the online scheduling for a Veteran. Some Veterans use the legacy MHV portal to manage their appointments at Vista sites and others may use legacy My VA Health tool for their Oracle Health appointments. The proposed changes will give the user to schedule an appointment at either site (Vista/Oracle Health) as long as they meet the eligibility requirements. 
    
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - Meet user expectations of available online transactions
  - Support Oracle Health system

## Desired Outcomes

     -  
- MVP for direct schedule for an appointment:
     - 
- Community Care request is not supported at this time for Oracle Health site.

## Measuring Success

- Success will be measured by the increased number of veterans using VAOS instead of MHV
- Will look at these specific measurements:
  - Number of unique users of VAOS
  - Number of pageviews of appointment list page
  - No increase in average response time of appointment list page
  - Decrease in the number of errors when fetching appointment data (desired)

  - We will have one Appointments tool on VA.gov for a better user experience for the Veteran
    
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Must work with our engineers to see how to integrate a new service (VPG) into the current application
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
