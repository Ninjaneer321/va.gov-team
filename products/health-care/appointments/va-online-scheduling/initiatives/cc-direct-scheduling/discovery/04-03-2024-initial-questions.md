# Initial questions for meeting on Wednesday, April 3, 2024

## Initial quesitons to understand integration 
- What’s the process and eligibility checks that VA staff currently complete to get a CC referral approved? (We think there are 2 or 3 rounds of eligibility checks + authorization for care, as well as getting the confirming referral acceptance confirmation from the CC provider.)
- Where do you envision the CC Direct Scheduling experience starting for the Veteran? 
     - Surfacing an existing approved referral and start scheduling from there? (If so, what system will provide the referral information and tell us that a Veteran can schedule an appointment?)
     - Or, would this process start with requesting a CC referral online? And, if so, how? For example, is the request a CC appointment in VAOS today kicking off the referral process in any way? (If so, what system will provide the referral information and tell us that a Veteran can schedule an appointment?)  
- Could you walk us (maybe by way of demo) through the steps that MSAs go through to schedule an appointment with a CC provider using WellHive so we can better understand how the referral process connects to scheduling an appointment? 
- What feedback have MSAs had about using WellHive to schedule CC appointments for Veterans? 
     - Specifically, have there been any pain points that they foresee Veterans running into that we need to address in the CC Direct Scheduling workflow? E.g., searching by their address, understanding NPI, using the calendar, can’t book an appointment because someone else already booked that time slot, etc.  
- Do we envision removing the Request a CC Appointment feature when we launch the CC Direct Scheduling pilot? Or, would those continue to coexist? 
- [Engineering] Should Veterans using CC Direct Scheduling only be able to schedule an appointment from a filtered list of CC providers within a certain radius that we retrieve from WellHive? Or, does the CC Direct Scheduling/VAOS application need to do that filtering on our end to show specific providers based on specific criteria? If so, what is that criteria? 
- Currently, what notification mechanisms are in place to let Veterans know an appointment has been canceled, if a provider or MSA cancels an appointment from WellHive?
- Does WellHive have any Veteran or consumer-facing provider directories (i.e., government or private sector) that offer a great user experience that we can reference when designing to fit within VA.gov?
