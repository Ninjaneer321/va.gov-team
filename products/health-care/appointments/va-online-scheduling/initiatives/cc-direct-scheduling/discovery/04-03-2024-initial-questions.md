# Initial questions for meeting on Wednesday, April 3, 2024

## Initial quesitons to understand integration 
- What feedback have MSAs had about using WellHive to schedule CC appointments for Veterans? Specifically, have there been any pain points that they foresee Veterans running into that we need to address in VAOS? E.g., searching by their address, understanding NPI, using the calendar, canâ€™t book a time slot because of the refresh rate, etc.  
- Confirm: Where do you envision the CC VAOS experience starting for the Veteran? Scheduling an appointment from an existing referral? (If so, what system will tell us that a Veteran can schedule an appointment?) Or, requesting a CC referral online first, then scheduling once approved? 
- Could you walk us (maybe by way of demo) through the steps that MSAs go through to schedule an appointment with a CC provider using WellHive so we can better understand how the referral process connects to scheduling an appointment? 
- Do you see the online CC request form going away? If so, how do you envision that step being replaced?  
- Confirm: Should Veterans in VAOS only be able to schedule an appointment from a filtered list of CC providers within a certain radius that we retrieve from WellHive? Or, does VAOS need to do that filtering of providers that we get in return from WellHive?
- Currently, what notification mechanisms are in place to let Veterans know an appointment has been canceled, if a provider cancels the appointment from WellHive?
- Does WellHive have any Veteran or consumer-facing provider directories (i.e., government or private sector) that offer a great user experience that we can reference when designing to fit within VA.gov?
