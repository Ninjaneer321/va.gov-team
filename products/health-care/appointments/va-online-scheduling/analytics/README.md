## Behavior analytics (shows what users are doing or feeling)

**Sources:** Google Analytics, Loki  


ðŸ“ˆ Increase the percentage of successful VA direct schedule appointments.


ðŸ“ˆ Increase the percentage of Veterans who successfully schedule Community Care appointments.


ðŸ“ˆ Increase satisfaction across all flows and in the list.


ðŸ“‰ Decrease the percentage of sessions that encounter, or end in any error state.


ðŸ“‰ Decrease time taken to schedule or request any appointment successfully.



## Qualitative analytics (shows why they're doing or feeling it)

**Sources:** Continuous research with Veterans, Medallia Feedback, VSignals, Office Of Connected Care (TBD), Research equity tracker.
Capture task success rate from end-to-end usability tests twice a year on production (or staging if thatâ€™s not possible). 


### Veterans understand how to navigate the appointments tool.


### Veterans can find all the information they need about their appointments by using the tool.

- Medallia feedback: data issues decrease
- User research: no new data requests come in, all data is clear


### Veterans have all the tools they need to manage their appointments.

Feature requests in Medallia feedback and usability studies should decrease as we add new features.


### Veterans understand, and can easily answer, all questions in scheduling flow.

No current way to track this fully, only to some degree during usabilty tests when we update the feature.


### Increase percentage of underrepresented Veterans who schedule appointments through VAOS.

We add all of our studies to the [Aggregate Equity Checker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FptjVArKot0wb2X8efpNtTAl3Rd1qroaEQmWtJ-bDxM/edit#gid=1035614575) (Google Doc) - Demographics of participants in our Veteran studies. We review this when recruiting and update our recruitment criteria to include those we haven't spoken to.
