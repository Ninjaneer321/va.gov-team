# Research Plan for General UAT, Appointments team, 01/2025 


Background
----------

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The appointments team has redesigned appointment details pages for all appointment types. This includes Upcoming, past, canceled and requests.  

Also see [Product's initiative brief.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/appointment-details-redesign/appointment-details-redesign-initiative-brief.md)


### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase ðŸ“ˆ

* Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

Decrease ðŸ“‰


* Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

* MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

* MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
* MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

* Maintaining my emotional health
* Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring


* MTM: Taking care of my health
* MTM: Managing my declining health
  
## Research Goals	
1. Evaluate how effectively Veterans navigate the appointments tool.
2. Validate the usability of actions and tasks in the appointments tool.
3. Evaluate how Veterans understand the information provided to them.

### Outcome
This research will provide insights into how effectively Veterans can navigate the appointments tool, complete key tasks, and understand the information presented to them. These findings will inform design refinements, ensuring the tool is accessible, intuitive, and meets user expectations. The learnings will be used to prioritize improvements, validate design decisions, and guide the development of a more user-centered, efficient, and inclusive experience for Veterans.

### Research questions

**Navigation - Evaluate how effectively Veterans navigate the appointments tool**
1.  How effectively can users, including those with screen readers (or voice control?), navigate through the app to locate and review appointment lists?
2. Can Veterans navigate to and from sections, such as the AVS or other tools using the secondary navigation or back links?
3. Does the navigation experience meet their expectations?

**Action/Task - Validate the usability of actions and tasks in the appointments tool**
1. Are Veterans able to complete tasks, such as scheduling appointments and requests, reviewing appointment details, canceling appointments, joining video visits, and adding appointments to their calendar, without confusion or error?
2. Do users experience any challenges when completing these tasks?

**Comprehension - Evaluate how Veterans understand the information provided to them.**
1. Do Veterans understand instructions for preparing for their visit?
2. Do Veterans understand the meaning of "Recent Locations"?
3. Is error messaging clear and helpful, enabling Veterans to recover from issues and proceed with their tasks? Confusing?


### Hypothesis
1. Hypothesis for navigation:
Veterans, including those using assistive technologies, will be able to navigate the app to locate and review their appointment lists efficiently without encountering barriers or confusion. Veterans will find the secondary navigation or back links intuitive and will successfully use them to navigate between sections.
2. Hypothesis for completing tasks:
Veterans will be able to complete key tasks (e.g., scheduling, reviewing, canceling, joining video visits, and adding appointments to their calendar) with minimal confusion or errors.
3. Hypothesis for comprehension:
Veterans will understand instructions for preparing for their visits. Veterans will correctly interpret the meaning of "Recent Locations" as places they have visited or scheduled appointments at. 



## Methodology	
User acceptance testing (UAT) 

### Location
Remote, moderated, on Zoom. 

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials â€“ including this plan â€“  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
**Please do not include email addresses in this section.** We previously required email addresses. VA's GitHub policy ([see announcement](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/discussions/13)) has changed. VA.gov email addresses cannot be in public repositories.

**Please list the names of people in each role.** In the Slack study channel, send an email and primary phone number for the moderator. Send emails only for the notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker.

- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers: List the names of people observing the sessions. This includes VA stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, and any other people who might find this research relevant to their work. Spread observers across sessions. There should be no more than 5 to 6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side.
