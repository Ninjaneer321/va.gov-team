# P8 Notetaker Notes

**Notetaker:** Peter Russo

## 1: Upcoming In-Person Appointment

You know you have an appointment scheduled with Dr. Ralph Scott and want to know more information about it. How would you do that from here?

Sometimes it’s hard to find things when you login. Usually I have to click on everything until I find it.

It says I have an in-person appointment with optometry. That’s good because sometimes I don't know who I'm talking to or where I’m going. It’s just a checkup.

> Issues with data loading.

If you can cancel, should you be able to confirm? Sometimes I get a text message that lets me do that. If I’m in there maybe you can say confirm, next to the print.

> Click cardiology with Dr Trager. This one doesn’t say Video - oh actually it does, in big bold print.

(Notetaker: I missed a bit here.)

> Reviews “How to join” instructions

The first paragraph is a little confusing. I thought they were just instructions for iPad or iPhone. I started to look further down for Android/computer advice. I didn’t think this applied to me because I’m not using an iPad.

F: Prompts to find the “join appointment” link.

F: Prompts to go back to the first appointment.

I didn’t see a phone number on another appointment I viewed. If I was having a problem joining an appointment I’d want that there. This phone number probably calls Dr. Scott or the blue team, though I doubt it goes directly to him.

Details I shared, review your personal health care contacts. It says prepare for your visit, but maybe since this is optometry, it’s my primary care doctor.

> Clicks link

Oh, it's My information. Okay.

> Reads page.

Oh, that’s good to know that you can do that. When you log in for video appts you have to put in your name and address so if you’re on a video call they know where to send 911 if you’re having an episode on your video. It’d be nice if they had something like that right in there. You could just push home address, and if this showed my home address as a point of contact it would already be in the system.

There should be an edit button. This is really just letting me look at what’s on file. It’s not letting me do anything. It says to call us, but that should be available in MyVA also. If there’s not an edit button here, then maybe where it says emergency contact then it should take me to that screen in My VA and let me do that. Because if I just edit it here, it might just be for this appointment, not my entire profile. If it was a link to take you to your record you could update it overall.

F: Prompts to find sleep medicine appt

I don’t see a way to go back to my appointment. How would I do that from here? So I'll hit the back button on my phone rather than on the screen. I’m not sure if it’s going to exit me or take me back to my appointment.

F: Prompts to click VA in the header.

## 3: Upcoming closed video appointment

You have a video appointment scheduled with Allison Carter next month. You want more information on the appointment, how would you do that from here?

> Reviews appointment page

I don’t see the link so I must be here too early. Will it show up at some point? Would it say something though because I'm outside the 30 minutes? Should it say come back or something? Right now it seems like it might not just appear - if I just sat here would it show up. Maybe it should say come back close to your appointment.

Oh, and it does have the phone number on this one too even though it’s a vid appt. I don’t remember seeing that on the first one we tried. But it’s here now if I need help.

## 5: ATLAS

You have an audiology scheduled for 2 pm on Wednesday the 14th and want to find out how to get to the appointment. How would you do that from here?

It says I have a vid appointment at an atlas location. I don’t know what atlas is or how to get to that. If I go further down it says an address and I can click for directions. That doesn’t make sense. It’s a video appointment, why should I go to an address? It should have a  link for the atlas location, not a building location.

F: Explains atlas

Oh, if they don’t have computer access. So if I don't have computer access, how am I seeing this?

Oh, it says use this code to find the computer provided at the site. But if I don’t have a computer, do I get this code mailed to me? That’s just what’s going through my head right now. I don’t know where to get the code if I don't have the computer.

Oh, and I have a blank box again. It should say print but it’s missing.

F: If you had any questions and you needed to ask someone how would you do that. It says you can contact scheduling with this phone number. Or I can find my health facilities number by calling that number.

> Reads through need help

Wouldn’t joining the video be the same as technical issues? I feel like I have too many people to call to get help. Because if I can't connect, that's a technical issue in my head. I don’t know which number to call. And every number I've called at VA I’m on hold for at least a half an hour.

> F: What phone are you on

It’s a Samsung Galaxy only a year old. Android. Samsung galaxy.
