# Hypotheses and Tasks to test

We'll use these when developing the research plan. Our main goal is to test the OH integration. 


## Oracle Health Integration

### Hypotheses 

Veterans will want to choose a specific provider for most types of care.
- Do their needs change between Primary care and specialty?
- Do their needs change between established care and new care?

Veterans will want to choose a provider by whoever has the soonest availability

### Scenarios

1. A Veteran wants to schedule an appointment for primary care with their established provider.

2. A Veteran wants to schedule an appointment for specialty care (like audiology) and doesn't have an established provider.
- Is the information provided helpful? What would be more useful?
- (Might be answered in the cc study) What sorting/filtering options would be helpful?

3. A Veteran scheduling an appointment for specialty care (like weight management) at an OH facility selects the "any provider" option.

4. A Veteran scheduling an appointment for specialty care (like eye care) at an OH facility selects "I need a different provider"


## Scheduling Improvements

Note - all are TBD

### Hypotheses

When searching for a new location, Veterans will expect to see all locations near them, not just where they are registered.

Veterans will want to choose a location where they've recently scheduled an appointment.

Veterans want to be a shortcut to schedule appointments similar to those they've had in the past. 

Scheduling appointments similar to those they've had in the past will help Veterans schedule more quickly. 

Veterans need reminders that the scheduling tool is not for emergencies.
