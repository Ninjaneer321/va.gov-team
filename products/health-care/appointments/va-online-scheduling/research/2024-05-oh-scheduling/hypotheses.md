# Hypotheses and Tasks to test

We'll use these when developing the research plan. Our main goal is to test the OH integration. 


3. **Tailored and timely urgent medical need alerts will improve the responsiveness and appropriateness of care for Veterans.**
   - When the reason for the appointment includes severe or alarming signs and symptoms
   - When the user selects "I need immediate care"  

4. **Improvements to the Patient Indicated Date (PID) functionality will be positively received by users.**

5. **Notifications are viewed as helpful**## As a Veteran, I can schedule an appointment at an Oracle Health facility.

### Scenario to test

A Veteran schedules an appointment without selecting a provider or a clinic.

### Hypothesis

Veterans will not expect to choose a clinic or provider when choosing a time slot.

## As a Veteran, I can easily schedule at locations I've recently attended.

### Scenario to test

A Veteran chooses from a list of their recent locations when scheduling an appointment.

### Hypotheses

- Choosing from locations where they've recently scheduled an appointment will make it faster and easier to schedule.
– The Veterans will appreciate and find value in the default "Sort by Recent locations"

## As scheduling staff, I know what date a Veteran preferred to schedule their appointment

### Scenario to test

A Veteran chooses their preferred date from an improved date picker.

### Hypothesis

Veterans will be able to select a preferred date faster and more easily than in the current flow.

## As a Veteran, I can quickly schedule from previous appointments

### Scenario to test

When scheduling, a Veteran is offered the option skip directly to choosing a time by scheduling into previously attended appointments.

### Hypotheses

– Veterans will want a shortcut to schedule appointments similar to those they've had in the past. 
- Veterans will have a distinct preference to scheduling using the past provider or clinic flow compared to the "type of care" route.
- Scheduling appointments similar to those they've had in the past will help Veterans schedule more quickly. 

## As a Veteran, I need helpful reminders that the scheduling tool is not for emergencies in appropriate places in the process so that it is not an annoyance. 

### Scenarios to test

A Veteran encounters the urgent need warning: 
- When the reason for appointment includes sever or alarming signs and symptoms
- When they select TOC" I need immediate care" 

### Hypotheses

- Veterans will find these warnings necessary
- Veterans will find these warnings helpful
- Veterans will find that the alert is timely and appropriate

## As a Veteran, I want to be alerted when appointments events happen so I know exactly what I need to do next

### Scenario to test

- A Veteran receives a new notification

- A Veteran reviews their list of notifications including:
    - They have received a new referral for community care
    - Staff has canceled their appointment
    - Others TBD

### Hypothesis

- Veterans will be able to find their notifications without prompting
- Veterans will understand how to review their notifications
- Veterans will find their notifications helpful

## Not testing

### As a Veteran, I can choose my provider when scheduling at an OH facility

#### Hypotheses 

Veterans will want to choose a specific provider for most types of care.
- Do their needs change between Primary care and specialty?
- Do their needs change between established care and new care?

Veterans will want to choose a provider by whoever has the soonest availability.

#### Scenarios to test

1. A Veteran wants to schedule an appointment for primary care with their established provider.

2. A Veteran wants to schedule an appointment for specialty care (like audiology) and doesn't have an established provider.
- Is the information provided helpful? What would be more useful?
- (Might be answered in the cc study) What sorting/filtering options would be helpful?

3. A Veteran scheduling an appointment for specialty care (like weight management) at an OH facility selects the "any provider" option.

4. A Veteran scheduling an appointment for specialty care (like eye care) at an OH facility selects "I need a different provider"
