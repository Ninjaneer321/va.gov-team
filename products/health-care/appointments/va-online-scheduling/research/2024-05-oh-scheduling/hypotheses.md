## Oracle Health Integration

### Hypotheses 

Veterans will expect to choose a specific provider for most types of care when scheduling.

Veterans will choose a provider by whoever has the soonest availability.

Veterans will be confused when selecting a clinic for some locations and providers for the other.

### Tasks

- Select a provider
- Select a time

## Scheduling Improvements

Veterans want to be a shortcut to schedule appointments similar to those they've had in the past. This will help them schedule appointments more quickly.
