## Research Goals

Evaluate a scheduling flow for booking an appointment at an Oracle Health facility, including selecting a provider during scheduling.

Test concepts for improving the scheduling flow, including:
- Providing an option to quickly schedule from previous appointments.
- Showing locations where the Veteran has scheduled recently first in the "choose a location" list.
- Better timing for displaying a message that the tool is not intended for urgent care.
- Test a concept for sharing important messages and tasks with Veterans.

Outcome:
This research will provide insights into whether the new features — such as scheduling from recent appointments, sorting by recent locations, and helpful alerts and reminders — make the process faster, easier, and more valuable for Veterans.

After this research is complete, we will:
- Improve the user experience for Oracle Health scheduling based on feedback.
- Choose which scheduling improvements are most valuable for the dev team to implement.
- Provide teams working on appointment notifications with the results of the study that show how Veterans responded to the notification workflow.

## Research Questions

**Oracle Health scheduling:**
1. What information do Veterans want when deciding between providers?
2. Is it clear that these are providers they've seen before?
3. What are their expectations around requesting an appointment with a different provider?

**Immediate care alerts:**
1. Is it clear to Veterans that the tool is not for urgent medical needs?
2. Do Veterans find the warnings about urgent medical needs necessary, helpful, and timely, or frustrating and unnecessary?
3. Is having the "I need immediate care" option helpful?

**Quickly schedule based on previous appointments:**
1. Does scheduling from previous appointments make the scheduling process faster and easier for Veterans?
2. Does scheduling from previous appointments add other value for Veterans?

**Recent locations:**
1. Is it clear that the list is sorted by locations they've visited recently?
2. Does the "Sort by recent locations" feature make scheduling easier for Veterans?
3. Does the "Sort by recent locations" add value?

**Notifications:**
1. Do Veterans notice the notification bell when it becomes active?
2. Are Veterans able to easily navigate to their notifications?
3. For each type of notification, is the content clear or confusing?
4. For each type of notification, is the CTA clear or confusing?
5. What do they expect the next step to be after clicking the CTA?
6. Do they distinguish between tasks that need their attention vs. their activity?

## Methodology 

For this usability study, we used the moderated usability testing method. This approach involved live, one-on-one sessions through Zoom where a facilitator guided participants through a series of tasks using a prototype of the scheduling flow. The facilitator observed participants' interactions, collected their feedback, and probed for deeper insights into their experiences.

This test included 2 versions of the appointments list:

• Mobile
• Desktop

**Location:** Zoom

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**Hypothesis 1:** As a Veteran, I can choose my provider when scheduling at an OH facility.
- Veterans will want to choose a specific provider for most types of care.
  - TRUE: Several veterans expressed they would prefer to see who they are familiar with, otherwise would like specific information about the providers to make an informed decision. (Furthermore, 5 Participants expressed a desire to know if they have seen a provider before, as they do not always remember names but recognize the importance of continuity in care.)
- Veterans' privider preferences change between primary care and specialty care?
  - Mixed: This was very situaltion depedent. Veterans expressed the desire for a "no preference" option for speciality care or in an immediate health care need in order to see the first available. 
- Veterans' privider preferences change between established care and new care?
  - TRUE: Veterans mentioned the desire for choosing a privider based on the following: (5 participants indicated a clear need for more detailed information about each provider, including credentials, specialties, and experience.)
- Veterans will want to choose a provider based on who has the soonest availability.
  - TRUE: 3 participants prioritize booking the first available appointment over specific provider preferences.

**Hypothesis 2:** As a Veteran, I can easily schedule at locations I've recently attended.
- Choosing from locations where they've recently scheduled an appointment will make it faster and easier to schedule.
    - INCONCLUSIVE: Without using the Veterans' real data, it is difficult to test this hypothesis. 
- Veterans will appreciate and find value in the default "Sort by Recent Locations."
  - FALSE: There was a stronger preference to see what is colsest to them.  

**Hypothesis 3:** As a Veteran, I can quickly schedule from previous appointments.

- Veterans will want a shortcut to schedule appointments similar to those they've had in the past.
  - TRUE: Veterans appreciated how this feature streamlined the appointment making process and provided details on who they saw.
- Veterans will have a distinct preference for scheduling using the past provider or clinic flow compared to the "type of care" route.
  - TRUE: When asked to schedule an appointment, they would first check to see if they could schedule from a past appointent listed. 
- Scheduling appointments similar to those they've had in the past will help Veterans schedule more quickly.
  - TRUE: See above


**Hypothesis 4:** As a Veteran, I need helpful reminders that the scheduling tool is not for emergencies in appropriate places in the process so that it is not an annoyance.

- Veterans will find these warnings necessary.
  - TRUE Several participants mentioned the importance of the alert for stopping to consider if they needed immediate care. 
- Veterans will find these warnings helpful.
  - TRUE Participants generally found the warnings helpful. 
- Veterans will find that the alert is timely and appropriate.
  - MIXED: While several participants found the alert timely and necessary, some expressed irritation or found it redundant. 

**Hypothesis 5:** As a Veteran, I want to be alerted when appointment events happen so I know exactly what I need to do next.
- Veterans will be able to find their notifications without prompting.
    - FALSE: Veterans needed heavy prompting
- Veterans will understand how to review their notifications.
    - TRUE: Veterans general response to the red bell was to click on it. 
- Veterans will find their notifications helpful.
  - TRUE: Some veterans mentioned the reminders for the actionable items being helpful.

## Key Findings

### Provider Selection

1. 5 Participants expressed a desire to know if they have seen a provider before, as they do not always remember names but recognize the importance of continuity in care. "It might be nice to know if I'd ever seen the people I'm looking at. Maybe I remember I saw a woman before, but don't know if it was Sarah or Emily" [P14]
2. 6 participants assumed the providers listed were all of the available providers at the clinic. "The way that I read this now is, it's just who's ever in the clinic." [P5]
3. 5 participants indicated a need for more detailed information about each provider, including credentials, specialties, and experience."I personally, ( would like to see) years of experience. You know, when I go to a surgeon I want to know that they're I'm not their 1st 1st operation." [P8]
4. 8 participants were unsure whether the displayed providers are those they have seen in the past, those available at the clinic, or those accepting new patients."These might be people, doctors, nutritionists who I've seen before - or maybe I've never seen them before, and do I like the name Sarah or Emily better?"[P12]
5. There was a wide range in how the word "request" was interpreted.

### Immediate care alerts

1.  All participants understood the scheduling tool is not meant for emergency care however, when given the scenario that they have had a fever for 3 days and were not getting better, it was less clear if they would be able to get an appointment immediately using this tool. "I would also go, probably to start scheduling to see what I can find if I can find an immediate option." [P1]
2.  Some participants expressed frustraition due to an overuse of the alerts [P4, P5, P7, P8].
