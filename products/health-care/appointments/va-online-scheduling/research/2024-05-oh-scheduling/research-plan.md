### OCTO Priorities 

The research on the new scheduling flow aligns most closely with Objective 1 of OCTO-DE Priorities 2024: "Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits." Specifically, it supports Key Result 1: "CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points."

By creating a unified scheduling portal that enhances usability and accessibility for Veterans, the research aims to improve their satisfaction with the digital experience of scheduling appointments. This directly contributes to the goal of increasing CSAT for VA web products.

### Veteran Journey
Starting up, taking care of myself and aging. 

### Research Goals

1. **Evaluate Usability**:
   - Understand how easily users can navigate the unified scheduling portal.
   - Identify any barriers to accessibility for users with disabilities.

2. **Assess User Satisfaction**:
   - Measure users' satisfaction with the new scheduling flow.
   - Determine if the unified portal reduces confusion and frustration compared to the previous separate systems.

3. **Identify Areas for Improvement**:
   - Gather user feedback on specific pain points or challenges within the scheduling process.
   - Collect suggestions for enhancements to further streamline and improve the user experience.

### Outcome

This research will provide insights into the effectiveness of the unified scheduling flow and general improvements in terms of usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. The findings will guide the refinement of the design to ensure it meets the needs of Veterans. 

### Research Questions

**Goal 1: Evaluate Usability**
- **How easily can users complete the appointment booking process using the unified portal, considering they can only select providers they have seen before?**
- **What accessibility barriers do users with disabilities encounter when using the portal?**
Ensure compliance with accessibility standards and improve usability. (While we are not testing with screen reader users, we plan to test with individuals with cognitive disabilities.)

**Goal 2: Assess User Satisfaction**
- **How do users rate their overall satisfaction with the new scheduling flow compared to the previous systems, given the constraint on provider selection?**
- **What specific aspects of the unified portal do users find most and least satisfying, considering the provider selection limitation?**

**Goal 3: Identify Areas for Improvement**
- **What pain points or challenges do users experience during the scheduling process, especially regarding the limitation on selecting new providers?**
- **What suggestions do users have for enhancing the scheduling portal within the current constraints?**

### Hypotheses

#### Oracle Health Integration

1. **Veterans will easily be able to schedule an appointment with a provider they have seen in the past 12 months.**

#### General Scheduling Improvements

1. **Veterans will have distinct preferences when using the “express lane” flow compared to the Type of care route.**


2. **Veterans will prefer to choose locations where they have recently scheduled appointments. They will appreciate and find value in the default "Sort by Recent locations"**


3. **Tailored and timely urgent medical need alerts will improve the responsiveness and appropriateness of care for Veterans.**
   - Specifically, when Mental Health TOC (Type of Care) is selected from either the TOC page or the express lane, and when the reason for the appointment includes severe or alarming signs and symptoms, particularly if the indicated date is today. 

4. **Improvements to the Patient Indicated Date (PID) functionality will be positively received by users.**

5. **Notifications are viewed as helpful**

## Methodology

### Overview

For this usability study, we will employ a **moderated usability testing** method. This approach involves live, one-on-one sessions where a facilitator guides participants through a series of tasks using a prototype of the unified scheduling flow. The facilitator will observe participants' interactions, collect their feedback, and probe for deeper insights into their experiences.

### Why Moderated Usability Testing?

Moderated usability testing is appropriate for the goals of this research and the maturity of the design for several reasons:

1. **Direct Interaction**: It allows for real-time interaction between the facilitator and participants, enabling immediate clarification and deeper probing into specific user behaviors and feedback.
2. **Detailed Observations**: The facilitator can observe non-verbal cues and behaviors that might indicate confusion or frustration, which are crucial for understanding the nuances of usability issues.
3. **Flexibility**: The facilitator can adjust the session flow based on participants' needs, exploring unexpected issues or delving deeper into particularly interesting areas.
4. **Quality Feedback**: Participants can provide immediate, contextual feedback while interacting with the prototype, offering insights that might be missed in unmoderated sessions.

### Study Design

 **Participant Recruitment**:
   - A diverse group of Veterans will be recruited, including those with various levels of digital proficiency and different types of care needs.
   - We will ensure representation of users with cognitive disabilities to assess accessibility barriers, although we are not focusing on screen reader users at this stage.

 **Session Structure**:
   - Each session will last approximately 60 minutes.
   - The session will begin with a brief introduction and consent process.
   - Participants will be asked to complete a series of tasks related to booking and managing appointments using the prototype.
   - Throughout the session, participants will be encouraged to think aloud, sharing their thoughts, expectations, and any difficulties they encounter.

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
