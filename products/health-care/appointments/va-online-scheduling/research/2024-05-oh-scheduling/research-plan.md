### OCTO Priorities 

The research on the new scheduling flow aligns most closely with Objective 1 of OCTO-DE Priorities 2024: "Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits." Specifically, it supports Key Result 1: "CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points."

By creating a unified scheduling portal that enhances usability and accessibility for Veterans, the research aims to improve their satisfaction with the digital experience of scheduling appointments. This directly contributes to the goal of increasing CSAT for VA web products.

### Veteran Journey
Starting up, taking care of myself and aging. 

### Research Goals

1. **Evaluate Usability**:
   - Understand how easily users can navigate the unified scheduling portal.
   - Identify any barriers to accessibility for users with disabilities.

2. **Assess User Satisfaction**:
   - Measure users' satisfaction with the new scheduling flow.
   - Determine if the unified portal reduces confusion and frustration compared to the previous separate systems.

3. **Identify Areas for Improvement**:
   - Gather user feedback on specific pain points or challenges within the scheduling process.
   - Collect suggestions for enhancements to further streamline and improve the user experience.

### Outcome

This research will provide critical insights into the effectiveness of the unified scheduling flow in terms of usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. The findings will guide the refinement of the design to ensure it meets the needs of Veterans. By addressing any identified issues and incorporating user feedback, we will be able to enhance functionality and user experience.

### Hypotheses

#### Oracle Health Integration

1. **Veterans will prefer to choose a specific provider for most types of care.**

2. **Veterans' preferences for providers will change based on the type of care (Primary vs. Specialty) and whether they have an established provider.**

3. **Veterans will prioritize scheduling with providers who have the soonest availability.**

#### Scheduling Improvements

1. **Veterans will want to see all nearby locations when searching for a new appointment, not just where they are registered.**

2. **Veterans will prefer to choose locations where they have recently scheduled appointments.**

3. **Veterans will want shortcuts to quickly schedule similar appointments to those they've had before.**

4. **Scheduling similar appointments to past ones will help Veterans schedule more quickly.**

5. **Veterans need reminders that the scheduling tool is not for emergencies.**

## Methodology

### Overview

For this usability study, we will employ a **moderated usability testing** method. This approach involves live, one-on-one sessions where a facilitator guides participants through a series of tasks using a prototype of the unified scheduling flow. The facilitator will observe participants' interactions, collect their feedback, and probe for deeper insights into their experiences.

### Why Moderated Usability Testing?

Moderated usability testing is appropriate for the goals of this research and the maturity of the design for several reasons:

1. **Direct Interaction**: It allows for real-time interaction between the facilitator and participants, enabling immediate clarification and deeper probing into specific user behaviors and feedback.
2. **Detailed Observations**: The facilitator can observe non-verbal cues and behaviors that might indicate confusion or frustration, which are crucial for understanding the nuances of usability issues.
3. **Flexibility**: The facilitator can adjust the session flow based on participants' needs, exploring unexpected issues or delving deeper into particularly interesting areas.
4. **Quality Feedback**: Participants can provide immediate, contextual feedback while interacting with the prototype, offering insights that might be missed in unmoderated sessions.

### Study Design

 **Participant Recruitment**:
   - A diverse group of Veterans will be recruited, including those with various levels of digital proficiency and different types of care needs.
   - We will ensure representation of users with cognitive disabilities to assess accessibility barriers, although we are not focusing on screen reader users at this stage.

 **Session Structure**:
   - Each session will last approximately 60 minutes.
   - The session will begin with a brief introduction and consent process.
   - Participants will be asked to complete a series of tasks related to booking and managing appointments using the prototype.
   - Throughout the session, participants will be encouraged to think aloud, sharing their thoughts, expectations, and any difficulties they encounter.

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
