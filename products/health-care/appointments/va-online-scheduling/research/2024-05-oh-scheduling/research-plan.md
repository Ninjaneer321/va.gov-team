# Research Plan for Appointments Oracle Health integration and scheduling improvements

## Background
VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.  Unified scheduling portal for both Vista and Oracle Health Facilities.The single interface streamlines the appointment booking process. Users can easily find and book appointments without switching between platforms.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase ðŸ“ˆ

-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an after visit summary, a print functionality on the appointment list page, and ease of navigation with updated breadcrums.

Decrease ðŸ“‰

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it.

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

-   MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

-   MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
-   MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

-   Maintaining my emotional health
-   Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

-   MTM: Taking care of my health
-   MTM: Managing my declining health


## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so donâ€™t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Methodology	
For this usability study, we will be using the **moderated usability testing** method. This approach involves live, one-on-one sessions thorough Zoom where a facilitator guides participants through a series of tasks using a prototype of the scheduling flow. The facilitator will observe participants' interactions, collect their feedback, and probe for deeper insights into their experiences.

## Recruitment	

Perigean will:
- recruit 16 total participants for this study.
- schedule a brief kickoff call to run through the recruitment criteria before recruiting.

### Recruitment Criteria

#### Total Number and Type of Participants
- **Total Participants:** 10-12
- 50% Mobile 50% Desktop
- **Type of Participants:** Veterans

#### Primary Criteria (Must-Haves)
Participants must meet the following criteria to effectively participate in the study:
1. ** 2-3 Veterans have Used the My VA Health Portal in the past 12 months.**

**Screener Questions:**
1. In the past 12 months or upcoming 12 months, did you or do you have appointments at any of the following facilities? (Yes/No)

Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington
Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center in Walla Walla, Washington
VA Central Ohio Healthcare System in Columbus, Ohio
Roseburg VA Health Care System in Roseburg, Oregon
VA Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center and Clinics in White City, Oregon

2. If yes, to Q. 1: Have you used the My VA Health Portal to review your Health appointments? (Yes/No)
   - **Qualifying Response:** Yes
   

   - **Qualifying Response:** Yes

#### Secondary Criteria (Nice-to-Haves)
**Secondary criteria:**

- At least 4 participants who attend sessions on a mobile device.
- At least 4 participants with a cognitive disabilty
- At least 1 LGBTQ+ Veteran
- At least 1 Native Veteran
- At least 1 who lives in a rural area

**Screener Questions:**
1. Do you identify as having a cognitive disability? (Yes/No)
   - **Qualifying Response:** Yes (looking for 2 participants)
2. Do you identify as being part of an underserved community (e.g., LGBTQ+, rural area, minority group)? (Yes/No)
   - **Qualifying Response:** Yes (looking for 2 participants)

By targeting these criteria, we ensure that our participant pool is both relevant to the study objectives and inclusive of diverse user experiences.





## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
