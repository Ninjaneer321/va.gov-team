# Research Plan for Appointments Oracle Health integration and scheduling improvements

## Background
VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments. 
### User Problem Statement
A very small percentage of Veteran appointments with VA Medical Centers are scheduled online. Other avenues for scheduling appointments like phone, secure messaging, reminder letters, and return to clinic orders can lead to clerical errors, miscommunications, and a heavier burden for schedulers. These issues cause delays in scheduling care and are frustrating for Veterans.

### OCTO Priorities 

By creating a unified scheduling portal that enhances usability and accessibility for Veterans, the research aims to improve their satisfaction with the digital experience of scheduling appointments.

### Veteran Journey
Starting up, taking care of myself and aging.

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Methodology	
For this usability study, we will be using the **moderated usability testing** method. This approach involves live, one-on-one sessions thorough Zoom where a facilitator guides participants through a series of tasks using a prototype of the scheduling flow. The facilitator will observe participants' interactions, collect their feedback, and probe for deeper insights into their experiences.

### Location
Zoom
### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
We will use Perigean to recruit participants. Our intended audience for this research includes Veterans who utilize Oracle Health VA facilities and have experience using the scheduling portal. 

### Recruitment Criteria

#### Total Number and Type of Participants
- **Total Participants:** 10-12
- 50% Mobile 50% Desktop
- **Type of Participants:** Veterans

#### Primary Criteria (Must-Haves)
Participants must meet the following criteria to effectively participate in the study:
1. **Veterans who have scheduled an appointment at an Oracle Health Facility .**

**Screener Questions:**
1. Have you used the My VA Health Portal to review your Health appointments? (Yes/No)
   - **Qualifying Response:** Yes
2. Do you have upcoming appointments at any of the following facilities? (Yes/No)

Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Washington
Jonathan M. Wainwright Memorial VA Medical Center in Walla Walla, Washington
VA Central Ohio Healthcare System in Columbus, Ohio
Roseburg VA Health Care System in Roseburg, Oregon
VA Southern Oregon Rehabilitation Center and Clinics in White City, Oregon

   - **Qualifying Response:** Yes

#### Secondary Criteria (Nice-to-Haves)
Participants who meet the primary criteria and also fit one or more of the following secondary criteria will strengthen our study results:
1. **Veterans with cognitive disabilities.**
2. **Veterans from underserved communities.**

**Screener Questions:**
1. Do you identify as having a cognitive disability? (Yes/No)
   - **Qualifying Response:** Yes (looking for 2 participants)
2. Do you identify as being part of an underserved community (e.g., LGBTQ+, rural area, minority group)? (Yes/No)
   - **Qualifying Response:** Yes (looking for 2 participants)

By targeting these criteria, we ensure that our participant pool is both relevant to the study objectives and inclusive of diverse user experiences.





## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
