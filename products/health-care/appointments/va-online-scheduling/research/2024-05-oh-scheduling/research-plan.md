### OCTO Priorities 

The research on the new scheduling flow aligns most closely with Objective 1 of OCTO-DE Priorities 2024: "Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits." Specifically, it supports Key Result 1: "CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points."

By creating a unified scheduling portal that enhances usability and accessibility for Veterans, the research aims to improve their satisfaction with the digital experience of scheduling appointments. This directly contributes to the goal of increasing CSAT for VA web products.

### Veteran Journey
Starting up, taking care of myself and aging. 

### Research Goals

1. **Evaluate Usability**:
   - Understand how easily users can navigate the unified scheduling portal.
   - Identify any barriers to accessibility for users with disabilities.

2. **Assess User Satisfaction**:
   - Measure users' satisfaction with the new scheduling flow.
   - Determine if the unified portal reduces confusion and frustration compared to the previous separate systems.

3. **Identify Areas for Improvement**:
   - Gather user feedback on specific pain points or challenges within the scheduling process.
   - Collect suggestions for enhancements to further streamline and improve the user experience.

### Outcome

This research will provide critical insights into the effectiveness of the unified scheduling flow in terms of usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. The findings will guide the refinement of the design to ensure it meets the needs of Veterans. By addressing any identified issues and incorporating user feedback, we will be able to enhance functionality and user experience.

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Methodology

### Overview

For this usability study, we will employ a **moderated usability testing** method. This approach involves live, one-on-one sessions where a facilitator guides participants through a series of tasks using a prototype of the unified scheduling flow. The facilitator will observe participants' interactions, collect their feedback, and probe for deeper insights into their experiences.

### Why Moderated Usability Testing?

Moderated usability testing is appropriate for the goals of this research and the maturity of the design for several reasons:

1. **Direct Interaction**: It allows for real-time interaction between the facilitator and participants, enabling immediate clarification and deeper probing into specific user behaviors and feedback.
2. **Detailed Observations**: The facilitator can observe non-verbal cues and behaviors that might indicate confusion or frustration, which are crucial for understanding the nuances of usability issues.
3. **Flexibility**: The facilitator can adjust the session flow based on participants' needs, exploring unexpected issues or delving deeper into particularly interesting areas.
4. **Quality Feedback**: Participants can provide immediate, contextual feedback while interacting with the prototype, offering insights that might be missed in unmoderated sessions.

### Study Design

 **Participant Recruitment**:
   - A diverse group of Veterans will be recruited, including those with various levels of digital proficiency and different types of care needs.
   - We will ensure representation of users with cognitive disabilities to assess accessibility barriers, although we are not focusing on screen reader users at this stage.

 **Session Structure**:
   - Each session will last approximately 60 minutes.
   - The session will begin with a brief introduction and consent process.
   - Participants will be asked to complete a series of tasks related to booking and managing appointments using the prototype.
   - Throughout the session, participants will be encouraged to think aloud, sharing their thoughts, expectations, and any difficulties they encounter.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
