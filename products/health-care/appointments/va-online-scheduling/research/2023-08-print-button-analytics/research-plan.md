# Print Button Analytics Research Plan - For VAOS, Appointments FE, 09/2023

## Background
VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

On 08/02/2023 the VAOS team released a feature for users to print their appointments list. This added a print button the the appointment lists using a new tertiary style. To assess the usability of the style and whether it's meeting a need, we will gather user behavior data and feedback from Medallia for one month after the release.

## Research Goals	
Track whether the new print feature is being used and meeting user needs.

### Outcome
We'll use this data to: 
- Assess if users are clicking the print button.
- Provide platform with data around usage of tertiary buttons.

### Research questions
- Are users clicking the print button?
- Are users leaving comments about the need for a print button?
    - How has that changed over time?
    - Is the feedback generally positive or negative?

### Hypothesis
- Comments about the lack of print feature will go down in Medallia.
- Usage of the print feature will rise, then level off and stay at a certain level.

## Methodology	
We will track: 
- Print feature usage in Google Analytics for one month after the feature is released.
- Print feature Medallia feedback from the two months before and after the feature is released.

## Timeline
The print button was released to prod on 08/02/2023. We'll track usage for one month after that.
