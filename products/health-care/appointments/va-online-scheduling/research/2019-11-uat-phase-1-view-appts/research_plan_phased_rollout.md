# Research Plan for VAOS Phased Rollout UAT


## Goals
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?
This is for the relaunch of VAOS on VA.gov. 

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 
The legacy mobile online scheduling application currently lives in VA's mobile store, mobile.va.gov. The front end of this application has been rebuilt on VA.gov. Key components of the application will be going live in November 2019 - view and cancel appointments, request community care appointments, request VA appointments, and self-schedule appointments. 

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 
- Are users getting through the flow? 
- Is the data showing up where it is supposed to show up? 

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
Veterans are able to view their upcoming appointments & appointment requests in a way that is logical and intuitive to them.

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 
UAT in production

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
We need to validate with real users using real data. 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*
Zoom 

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 
User flow and data flows 

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)
Zoom 

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)

First phase: 25 participants - 
- MUST be Veterans who have UPCOMING HEALTH appointments at VA (and thus have VA health). 
- MUST be Veterans who have a MHV premium account, OR an authenticated / identity-proofed ID.me account. They should have their account details handy for the session, as they will be required to sign in. 
Prior to the sessions, Veterans must log into VA.gov with their ID.me or MHV Premium accounts. 
- Veterans who have logged into VA.gov before the session with their accounts. Please tell participants to go to VA.gov and sign in with their MHV Premium or ID.me accounts prior to the session. If they have never logged into VA.gov before, VA.gov will require them to enter an email address to authenticate. We will need THAT email prior to the session. 


Second phase: 25 participants 
- Veterans who are enrolled in VA healthcare.
- Ideally, some Veterans who know that they are eligible for community care. 
- MUST be Veterans who have a MHV premium account, OR an authenticated ID.me account. 
- Veterans who have logged into VA.gov before the session with their accounts (they may need to do this beforehand). Please tell participants to go to VA.gov and sign in with their MHV Premium or ID.me accounts prior to the session. If they have never logged into VA.gov before, VA.gov will require them to enter an email address to authenticate. We will need THAT email prior to the session. 
- Veterans want to submit / request appointments. 
- Ideally, veterans should have used online scheduling before, or have been seen at a VA healthcare facility within the last 2 years.



2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 
Perigean 

## When? 
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 


2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 

IN phases - phase 1 is ready 11/14/19
Scheduling Phase 2 for the first week of December 

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 

15-30 minutes each.

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.




5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 

## Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker**

- Project point of contact: Lauren 
- Participant(s) for pilot test: n/a
- Note-takers: Mark? Jeff Balboni, Kam, etc.  
- Observers:
