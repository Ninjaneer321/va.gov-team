# About this Research Study
- **Study Name:** Appointment List Usability Screenreader Study
- **Study Dates:** (can be month study was held or specific)
- **Study Research Lead:** Peter Russo, Ciera Maddox
- **A11y Collaborators:** Josh Kim, Sara Smith, Sarah Koomson
- **Ticket Links:** [EPIC and/or CAIA research assistance request ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/55380)

# Accessibility Tools Utilized
`VoiceOver, iOS` `JAWs` `Talkback`

## Coverage

**Original study request:**

> (Primary) 12 participants that regularly use a screenreader

> (Secondary) A mix of advanced and beginner screenreader users.

- This research fulfilled 75% (9/12) of its original request. 
- Only 4 out of 12 participants were able to complete the session with their screen reader.
  - 2 advanced JAWS users
  - 1 begineer JAWS user
  - 1 advanced VoiceOver user

Given the limited amount of types of screen readers, any conclusive behavioral patterns cannot be determined locally in this study. 
We can, however, draw inferences, plan for future research considerations, and document caught accessibility issues.
