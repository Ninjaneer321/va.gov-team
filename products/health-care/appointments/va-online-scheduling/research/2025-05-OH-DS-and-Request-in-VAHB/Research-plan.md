	# Research Plan for [UAE Team, OH direct appointments scheduling and requesting in VAHB app, TBD]

## Background üèóÔ∏è
	
Currently, Veterans can only view their appointments on the VA Health and Benefits (VAHB) app. In contrast, the Appointments tool on VA.gov enables logged-in Veterans to schedule and manage their appointments. The UAE team aims to enhance the VAHB app by introducing the ability to schedule appointments, beginning with facilities that use Oracle Health (OH). This research supports an initiative to expand appointment-related functionality within the VAHB app, empowering Veterans to more easily schedule, request, and cancel appointments directly from their mobile devices.

### OCTO-DE Priorities

`Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

`Objective 2: OCTO‚Äôs platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

> - **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.


### Veteran Journey
	
- `Starting Up`
- `Taking Care of Myself`
- `Reinventing Myself`
- `Putting Down Roots`
- `Retiring`
- `Aging`


## Research Goals ü•Ö	

### Goals

`1.` **We want to evaluate how effectively and efficiently Veterans can schedule, request, and cancel with facilities that use Oracle Health within the VAHB app.**

`2.` **We want to identify pain points, usability issues, and unmet expectations for scheduling, requesting, and canceling with facilities that use Oracle Health within the VAHB app.**

`3.` **We want to understand Veterans' mental model and expectations related scheduling appointment.**
  
### Outcome

---

**This research will uncover what works well, where Veterans encounter friction, and how they mentally approach scheduling appointments. These insights will guide the team in making informed, user-centered design decisions that enhance the appointment experiencein both the VAHB app and the VA.gov web platform.** 

---

### Research questions

`Goal 1: We want to evaluate how effectively and efficiently Veterans can schedule, request, and cancel with facilities that use Oracle Health within the VAHB app.`
1. Can Veterans successfully schedule, request, and cancel appointments with Oracle Health facilities using the VAHB app?
2. How much time, how many taps/steps, and how many errors or reversals does it take Veterans to finish each task?
3. Do Veterans feel confident that their appointment actions (scheduling, requesting, canceling) were completed successfully, why and why not?

`Goal 2: We want to identify pain points, usability issues, and unmet expectations for scheduling, requesting, and canceling with facilities that use Oracle Health within the VAHB app.`
1. At which screens, fields, or decision points do Veterans encounter confusion, delays, or errors while scheduling, requesting, or canceling?
2. Where does the current flow, content, or feedback fall short of what Veterans expect when completing these tasks?
3. Which aspects of the experience create frustration, anxiety, or distrust, and why?

`Goal 3: We want to understand Veterans' mental model and expectations related scheduling appointment.`
1. How do Veterans decide to make an appointment when presented with available providers and scheduling options (online, request, and call)?
2. What details (e.g., provider name, last appointment date) do Veterans expect to see at each step to feel informed and in control?
3. How do Veterans think the overall appointment scheduling process ‚Äúshould‚Äù work, and if previous experiences shape their expectations and how?


### Hypotheses

---

1. At least 90 % of participants will successfully schedule, request, and cancel an appointment on their first attempt without facilitator assistance.
2. All participants will complete each task quickly; a few may back-track or abandon the scheduling flow before finishing.
3. At least 85 % of participants will rate their confidence in task completion as 4 or 5 on a 5-point scale.
4. The highest friction will occur on facilities selection and providers selection screens, due to personal needs and preferences.
5. Some participants will expect more content around features and functionalities that won't be available, such as type of care and providers they can't schedule with.
6. Most participants will prefer to schedule with a provider on the app now, instead of requesting and calling.
7. Participants will expect to see providers and their availabilities at the same time to help them choose who and when to schedule their appointments.

## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è
	
- Semi-structured interviews: Ask participants questions before starting the tasks, and ask follow up questions during and after tasks to understand their decision-making, and thought processes.
- Usability testing: Assign participants clear, representative tasks and observe their interactions with the tool ‚Äî measuring success rates, error patterns, and feedback ‚Äî to evaluate overall usability and identify areas for improvement.

## Recruitment üéØ	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 

> [!NOTE] 
> - Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
> - Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
> - Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

> [!NOTE]
> - **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
> - Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> [!TIP]
> - The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
> - Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
> - Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
