Research plan for VAOS appointments list usabilty test
=============

Background
----------

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The VA Online Scheduling and MyHealtheVet teams worked together to identify gaps between scheduling features in the two products. They completed an analysis [to identify gaps](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/HealthApartment/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B24A0A2A8-279E-42D1-B0E4-3C1C8EF5D5F5%7D&file=MHV%2BVAOS%20Gap%20analysis%20recommendations.docx&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.MAIN.SEARCH&ct=1656340079030&action=default&mobileredirect=true) (VA Network) between the two products. Then, the VAOS team [tested a design concept](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2022-01-mhv-and-vaos-appts-list-discovery/research-findings.md) that would meet the needs identified in the gap analysis.

The VAOS team also wants to evaluate potential changes to the appointment details page content and navigation.

Building on those activities, this research will evaluate:

-   The usability of the redesigned appointment list
-   A redesign concept for the appointment list detail pages

Also see [Product's initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/appointment-list/product-outline-appointment-list-2022.md).

### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase 📈

-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

Decrease 📉

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

-   MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

-   MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs

-   MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

-   Maintaining my emotional health

-   Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

-   MTM: Taking care of my health

-   MTM: Managing my declining health

Research goals
--------------

1.  Evaluate usability and value of the appointment list redesign.

2.  Test a concept for changes to the appointments details page.

### Outcome

We will use the findings to:

-   Finalize designs and update the appointments list. 
  
-   Decide on next steps for redesigning the details pages.

Evaluate usability and value of the appointment list redesign.

### Hypotheses

The appointments list will:
-   Provide clear, valuable information
-   Be easy to navigate

The details pages will:
-   Provide clear, valuable information.
-   Be easy to navigate.

### Research Questions

**1. Evaluate usability and value of the appointment list redesign.**

* Can appointments be found by:
    * Date/Time?
    * Modality?
    * VA vs CC?
  
* Do the type of care and provider name make sense in the list?

* Does “Pending” and “Past” language make sense?
    * Are Pending and Past appointments easy to navigate to?
  
* Are the details pages easy to navigate to?

* Can participants easily understand the meaning of modality in the appointment list - do they understand where they need to be?
  
* Do Veterans need a physical print “button”?

* What would Veterans do next after viewing their appts in the list?

**2. Test a concept for changes to the appointments details page.**

* Is the information on the details pages:
  * Easy to understand?
  * Easy to scan?
  
* Does the back button on the details page make sense?


Method
------

We'll run a moderated usability test on the appointments list redesign.

This test will include 2 versions of the appointments list:
-   Mobile
-   Desktop

### Location

Remote, over Zoom.
