## Research Plan: Tele-Urgent Care Veteran Study

## Background

The PTEMS Tele-Urgent Care experience is focused on the Veteran experience of getting access to care, specifically remotely. Can Veterans get non-emergency care from home, and do they know their options when it comes to telemedicine? 

## **High Level Objectives**

This effort supports these Office of Connected Care’s Goals: 

1. Increase the usage of Tele-Urgent care, reducing ED visits

2. Decrease the wait times for Veterans seeking Tele-Urgent Care services

3. Improve Veteran awareness and clarity of access to Tele-Urgent Care services

## **Research Goals**

The goal of this study is to understand the Veteran’s end to end experience of receiving urgent care remotely and discover unmet Veteran needs that might inform Tele-Urgent Care and related CRM implementations.  \

1. Develop a thorough understanding of the Veteran’s end-to-end experience of accessing immediate care at the VA. \

2. Discover what user needs might be unmet by the current implementation plan for  \
the CRM solution.
3. What new opportunities might we uncover to improve the Veteran  \
experience of Tele-Urgent Care? 

## Hypotheses

Uncovering opportunities to optimize the Veteran’s experience of Tele-Urgent Care will inform the development of an integrated, modern VAHC, and an optimized workflow will improve the overall Veteran Tele-Urgent care experience, reduce wait times, reduce call abandons, and reduce emergency department visits. 

We hypothesize that Veterans who utilize Tele-Urgent Care will reduce their need to visit the Emergency Room, and will increase the quality and efficiency of care they receive at the VA.

## Research questions

* What do Veterans need/want when seeking care that is defined as not emergent, but urgent and fits the recommended follow up interval of 0-2 or 2-8 hours for   diagnosis and treatment?

* Do Veterans have any awareness of such offerings currently and can Veterans easily distinguish between types of care?

* Do Veterans understand the technology needs for virtual visits?

* Is the technology and the communication of requirements accessible to Veterans and/or their caregivers? 

* Do Veterans feel secure in virtual visit environments?

* What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing for a Tele-Urgent visit?

## Method

Remote, contextual inquiry and observation will be used to gain a broader understanding of their experience and attitudes towards tele-medicine.  We will ask Veterans to share their screen and demonstrate how they might find tele-medicine / tele-urgent care from the VA.


## Participants and recruitment

We will utilize the Perigean contract recruiting. We'd like to schedule 10 participants to reach our goal of observing 5 participants.

Participant Criteria:
* Must have:
    * Have accessed Veteran healthcare before
    * All genders
    * Age 65+
    * Rural
    * Veterans & Caregivers or Family members
    * Enrolled in VA healthcare
    * At least 1/2 of participants have met with a medical provider via video or phone at the VA
        * Qualifying questions: have you used telehealth at the VA in the last year
            * If yes, qualify 3
            * If no, disqualify
        * Have you used telehealth (at any provider VA or otherwise) within the last year?
            * If yes, qualify 3
    * Access to a Laptop or desktop computer, and/or a mobile smart phone
    * At least one participant with cognitive disability
    * At least one participant _u_s_ing assistive technology, such as_
        * Screen reader (mobile and desktop, beginner and advanced)
        * Keyboard
        * Magnification
        * Hearing aids
        * Voice recognition
    * Be able to screen share via Zoom. Please confirm with them that they have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share.

* Good to have: 
    * At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 65
    * Two participants with different accessibility needs
    * At least one participant with mobility restrictions
