# Appointment Details Page Unmoderated Card Sort - Research Plan

## Background
As we incorporate more appointment-related information (i.e., pre and post care encounter) onto the appointment detail page, we continue to encounter questions around how the page is structured, what information on it is most important for Veterans, and how to incorporate multiple tasks that Veterans must (or can) complete for an appointment as those tasks become available. 

While the addition of the capability to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim acted as the catalyst for this research, this study aims to answer larger questions around the overall appointment detail page organization that will inform future interactions of the detail page in both the Appointments, Check-in, and, potentially, VAHB mobile applications.

### OCTO Priorities
The mileage-only travel reimbursement feature in Appointments on VA.gov aligns with the following OCTO-DE Priorities:
- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.

### Veteran Journey
This research corresponds to the following points of the Veteran journey:
- Taking care of myself

## Research Goals

### Outcome
This study will give us insight into how Veterans expect their information on the appointment details page to be organized, based on how they categorize different types of information and what they find most important. This will help us better organize the detail page to fit Veterans’ needs, while ensuring scalability when we add new appointment-related tasks, updates, or other appointment information.  

### Research Questions
- **How do Veterans group and define the pieces of information on their appointment detail page for Upcoming appointments?**
- **How do Veterans group and define the pieces of information on their appointment detail page for Past appointments?** 
- **What information do Veterans find most important when visiting appointment detail pages for Upcoming appointments?**
- **What information do Veterans find most important when visiting appointment detail pages for Past appointments?**
- **Is there any information missing from the appointment detail page that Veterans expect to find there?**

### Hypotheses
- How do Veterans group and define the pieces of information on their appointment detail page for Upcoming appointments?
  - HYPOTHESIS: For upcoming appointments, we expect Veterans to group information by categories such as “things to do,” and “information about their appointment” and “updates/alerts about changes related to their appointment.”
- How do Veterans group and define the pieces of information on their appointment detail page for Past appointments?
  - HYPOTHESIS: For past appointments, we expect Veterans to group information by categories such as “things to do,” “information about their appointment,” and “things they’ve completed.”
- What information do Veterans find most important when visiting appointment detail pages for Upcoming appointments?
  - HYPOTHESIS: For upcoming appointments, we expect Veterans to find “information about their appointment,” “things to do,” and “updates/alerts about changes related to their appointment” to be most important.
- What information do Veterans find most important when visiting appointment detail pages for Past appointments?
  - HYPOTHESIS: For past appointments, we expect Veterans to find “things to do” and “things they’ve completed” to be most important.
- Is there any information missing from the appointment detail page that Veterans expect to find there?
  - HYPOTHESIS: We expect Veterans will present 1-3 pieces of new information that they’d expect to find on the page, such as duration of appointment.

## Method
This research will be conducted as an unmoderated card sort study using Optimal Workshop.

### Location
The tests will be conducted online at the participant’s leisure.
