## Most to least mentioned categories

### Finding #1: Certain categories emerged as more common than others, with appointment information, scheduling, canceling/rescheduling, and post-appointment information and actions included most often. 

The top 5 most mentioned categories for past appointments were 20 Appointment (info), 14 Post appointment information and actions, 12.5 Travel reimbursement, 9.5 Payments / financial information, 4 Scheduling/setting up an appointment

#### Upcoming appointments
1. Appointment info (13)
2. Scheduling/making an appointment (13)
3. Canceling / rescheduling (8)
4. Before appointment (8)
5. Checking in (7)
6. Your information / health history (6)
7. Confirm information / review contact information (5)
8. During/day-of appointment (5)
9. Modify/manage appointment (4)
10. Location/reason (3)
11. Clinic information (3)

#### Past appointments
1. Appointment info (20)
2. Post appointment information and actions (14)
3. Travel reimbursement (12.5)
4. Payments / financial information (9.5)
5. Scheduling / setting up an appointment (4)
6. Critical information (2)
7. Provider details (2)

### Recommendation:
Use these categories as guidelines for how information could be organized on the page to better fit Veterans’ expectations and existing mental model, prioritizing categories that appeared most often.

For example, prioritize the categories such as Appointment info and Scheduling, followed by pre-appointment tasks for Upcoming appointments (Cancel/Reschedule, Checking in, and Confirming information) and post appointment information and tasks for Past appointments (Travel reimbursement and payments).


## Breakdown of category organization

### Finding #2: Participants created categories that separated tasks/statuses from static Appointment information. For upcoming appointments, 8 participants created a dedicated section focused mostly on pre-appointment info and actions. For past appointments, 14 participants created a category for post-appointment info and actions. 

#### Upcoming: 
- 8 participants created a Before appointment category with pre-appointment tasks.

#### Past: 
- Participants created three different sections for actions that come after the appointment. Most popular was Post-appointment information and actions, often overlapping with travel reimbursement and payments/financial information.

#### Recommendations
- Continue to use a separate section for travel reimbursement, and consider combining travel reimbursement with other payment-related items 
and/or consider including these actions within a post-appointment category (post appointment information or actions often overlap with travel reimbursement and payments items).
- Information/tasks to include:
  - File for travel reimbursement
  - You filed your travel reimbursement claim for this appointment,
  - Review the travel reimbursement claim you filed
  - Pay your copay

- Whether as a separate section or within notifications, consider creating a different section/treatment of these tasks and info that apply to post and pre-appointment tasks and categories. Explore if a notifications pattern can help surface these noticeably without taking over the page
  - Before appointment/ pre-appointment actions and info:
    - Answer health-related questions
    - You answered health-related questions
    - Review your address and contact information
    - You reviewed your address and contact information
    - Check in now
    - You checked in
  - Post-appointment actions and info:
    - Review or complete a clinical order
    - Review your after-visit summary
    - Possibly you completed your video appointment
    - File for travel reimbursement
    - You filed your travel reimbursement claim for this appointment
    - Review the travel reimbursement claim you filed
    - Pay your copay

- Incorporate information like checking in and confirming information into a larger category(ies) for pre/post-appointments actions and/or notifications:
  - Check in now
  - You checked in
  - Review your address and contact information
  - You reviewed your address and contact information
  - You answered health-related questions
  - Answer health-related questions

### Finding #3: For both upcoming and past, participants created clearly defined Appointments sections.

#### Upcoming: 
- **Appointments / Scheduling Findings:** Out of 24 participants, most participants created either an Appointments / appointment details section (13) or a Scheduling / making an appointment section (13). With the exception of Scheduling actions and statuses, both included similar information types. For both Upcoming and Past card sorts, participants identified an Appointment (info) category with similar cards (and rated this category as #1 or #2 importance).

#### Past: 
- **Appointment info Finding:** Out of the 20 participants who had an Appointment info category, most included the same 8 types of information: Time of appointment (18 participants), Provider name (18), Type of care (17), Location of appointment (17), Print appointment information (17), Modality (16), Clinic phone number (16), Your reason for wanting this appointment (16).
  - Some participants also included: Review your after visit summary (6), You completed your video appointment (5), Review or complete a clinical order (4).
  - For both Upcoming and Past card sorts, participants identified an Appointment (info) category with similar cards (and rated this category as #1 or #2 importance).

#### Recommendations
- For both past and upcoming, create a dedicated Appointments section/area that includes appointment information in a clearly called-out component or section (such as the appointment detail card) that is separate from other information on the page.
  - Include the following information:
    - Modality,
    - provider name,
    - time of appointment,
    - your reason for wanting this appointment,
    - Location,
    - type of care,
    - clinic phone number
- Either include the schedule action link as part of the appointments section or separate out on its own.
- Either include the print button as part of that section or pull out of that section on it's own - because mentioned on many pages.

### Finding #4: 8 Participants created canceling/rescheduling categories, and canceling/rescheduling tasks were often separate from other tasks/information

#### Upcoming:
- Canceling/rescheduling: 8 participants created Canceling/rescheduling groups in which they put Cancel and schedule actions and information together, often along with appointment change information

#### Recommendations 
- Continue to use a dedicated cancel/reschedule/make changes section

<img width="283" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-18 at 3 11 47 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8278783-172f-4af3-b63b-3407b4f5f966" />


### Finding #5: A small number of participants created categories such as provider details, clinic information, location/reason, modify / manage appointment

#### Upcoming
- Modifying/managing appointments: 4 participants included a category for modifying/managing appointments. However, there were not clear trends for the information included within the categories.
- Location/reason: 3 participants included a category for location/reason. However, there were not clear trends for the information included within the categories and this information was mentioned more often elsewhere.
- Clinic information: 3 participants included Clinic information categories.

#### Past
- 3 participants included a category for clinic information. However, this information was mentioned more often elsewhere.
- 2 participants included a category for critical information. However, this information was mentioned more often elsewhere.
- 2 participants included a category for provider details. However, this information was mentioned more often elsewhere.


### Recommendations

- Include smaller categories, such as clinic information, critical information, modifying/managing appointments, and provider details, these in bigger categories (likely the Appointments section) - consider using as sub-categories
  - Modify / manage appointment: Disperse this information throughout other categories where it was mentioned by participants more often.
  - Location/reason and Clinic information: Keep the information from these categories within Appointments info - or as a subsection of appointments info
  - Clinic information, Critical information, Provider details:  keep the information from these categories within Appointments info - or as a subsection of appointments info

## Category importance ratings

### Finding #6: 5 out of 24 participants numbered their categories to identify which they considered most or least important for upcoming appointments, while 6 out of 27 participants numbered their categories for past appointments. 

- However, the findings from this small participant pool align with the trend that the appointment information section is most important to Veterans.

#### Upcoming:
- Veterans listed Appointment information and scheduling (preliminary steps) as most important
- Veterans listed other actions completed by the Veteran as less important (confirming information, notifications, cancel scheduled appointment)

#### Past:
- Veterans listed Appointment information and information they marked as “most vital” (example?) as most important
- Veterans listed actions by the Veteran such as travel pay or financial-related items (co-pay) as less important

### Recommendations:
Because this aligns with other findings, continue to follow recommendations that prioritize Appointment information (and scheduling, for Upcoming appointments), while exploring how other tasks could be noticeable but possibly housed elsewhere or in the notification pattern, so as to not take up too much space on the page.

------
## Missing items

### Finding #7: 3 participants said there was information missing from the Upcoming appointments cards, and 6 participants thought there was information missing from the Past appointments cards.

- For upcoming appointments, 3 participants mentioned items they expected to find in the list that were missing: 1) is parking available 2) Taking medication/over the counter medication/taking additional supplements 3) ‘Your appointment was modified’...I didn’t not see in the list but that would be useful
- For past appointments, 6 participants mentioned items they expected to find in the list that were missing: 1) a list of prior visit results 2) being able to make a clinical appt for a specialty clinic, instead of calling, 3) information on care/aftercare/follow up 4) referrals for specialty care, follow up appointments (or # in series if appt was a follow up) 5) prescriptions 6) date of appointment

### Recommendations:
- Determine if any of the submitted items could be added to the Appointment details page.
- Refer back to previous research and Veteran feedback to review what items have been mentioned as missing in the past and if they align with these findings.
