**About this research** 
* We showed two updated desktop prototypes: individually or batch refilling prescriptions.
* We spoke to five Veterans who had refilled prescriptions in the past year; three have done so through MyHealtheVet.
* Our five remote participants were quite diverse: they served in the Army, National Guard, Marines and Navy, and were deployed in Vietnam, Kuwait, and OEF. One is a woman.

**What worked well**
* All participants commented on the site’s simplicity and/or clarity. People said it was intuitive like Amazon; users often identify Amazon as a site that does things like this well, so that’s a great compliment.
* Almost every participant completed every task without assistance. Some zoomed through the tasks so quickly we had to ask them to slow down to talk about parts of the site.
* Individual check-out was prefered to batch check-out; users thought it was very clear when prescription refills were completed.

**Challenges we saw**
* The two levels of navigation can be confusing for people, and sometimes they missed the top level that contained shipping information.
* Users wanted to see more instructions about the medicine use: should it be taken with food, stored a certain way, etc – the sort of things that they’d see as stickers on a pill bottle.
* Some wording was confusing, such as “not available” prescriptions including both those whose refill isn’t yet allowed by insurance and those which are out of refills.
* Some confirmation banners were large enough that they hid the content below, and users didn’t realize what page they were on for a moment.

**Next steps for the team**
* Focus on language we use around prescriptions.
* Work on top navigation, and which items should be at which level, considering future additions to the site.
* Look into including additional data: specific medication use & storage instructions, medicine brand names in addition to chemical names, and how much supply is included in refills.
* Work on the order of information on the medicine detail page; Rx # is less important than instructions, and warnings could look more like warnings.
* Investigate ways to select which portions of prescription history can be printed, such as currently active medicines or those from the past year.
* Visual design updates: make buttons and links stand out more, make confirmation banners a bit smaller to show content underneath. Check text sizes used on page styles; one page seemed smaller to users.

**Research logistics**
* Remote testing with Marvelapp prototypes and GoToMeeting screen-sharing was mostly smooth despite some participants needing some troubleshooting with the techology.
* We've begun a recruiting drive to make future research easier; that includes spreading an interest form on social media and starting outreach to student Veteran groups, Veteran service organizations, etc. If you know Vets that might like to participate in research, send them this form: http://goo.gl/forms/crjuMIC5xD0Cme8f1
