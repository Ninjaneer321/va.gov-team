Version one of the general error & outage procedures:

Acknowledge & Communicate that there is an error or outage present
-- Should be handled by the Data Analyst & PM team first as they typically have eyes on this. However Devs should be receiving notifications that an error or outage is present (when an alert captures it) and can start preparing to address it.

Informing Product owners that there is a problem (i.e. Tell Patrick, Adrian, and Kristen, etc...)
-- PMs can inform the stakeholders that there is an issue.

Review the errors (if any) and VA.gov monitors to determine if the root cause is on the form or sitewide
-- Data analyst is the first one on the scene here; Check logs to determine a root cause if possible (DD, Sentry, etc.). But as the investigation furthers past the dev op tools in place, Dev team will be pulled in shortly there after these sources have been exhausted. Maybe bring in UX folks to ask if there were content changes made in the recent days that could have impacted anything on site.

Mini Check Ins through out the first 4-6 hours of response
-- Analyst can Set up a call during the investigation with Dev / Analyst / PMs
-- Devs (when possible) to communicate a root cause when identified with the broader team. Or update the team that a cause is still unidentified within the first hours of the triage process. PMs can forward the updates as they come in.

Tell Stakeholders (HEC, CG team)
-- PMs can inform the stakeholders that there is an issue, or communicate that the scope of the issue extends outside of the code base we have access to with color commentary given by Devs when needed.

Talk to Platform
-- If needed, we can communicate with the platform team of necessary changes or reverts in the code base or that there needs to be other engineers from their side present to triage the problem.

Start postmortem and document timeline as you go
-- This is everyone contributing to the timeline doc specifically as they continue to do their part in the overall procedure. The start of the doc is something PMs can manage but the wrap up / takeaway side is by Devs & Analyst.
