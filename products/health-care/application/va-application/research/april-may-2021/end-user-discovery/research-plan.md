# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Discovery phase of Health Care application 10-10EZ, End users, April-May 2021

## Background

This research is to be conducted on the Health Care Application (10-10EZ) by the Caregivers team.

Live: (https://www.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction)
Staging: (https://staging.va.gov/health-care/apply/application/introduction)

The purpose of this discovery phase of research is to gain a broad understanding of why people start the VA Health Care Application form, but do not complete it. As the first form to become digitized on VA.gov, we want to better understand the impact digitization has had on end users (behavioral changes, new/different challenges, what’s easier/ more difficult), and explore ways to improve qualified application submission rates.

The data gathered through the Health Care application’s [Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HDGBx-whUrSArDLf8OP_-65lCMPi36h0ihHPA3XqmIk/edit#slide=id.p1) will serve as our foundation for creating this research plan. We would like to better understand from a human factors perspective what are the blockers, why they are occuring, and begin to understand what ways these can be mitigated to improve the qualified submission rate of the Health Care application.

Using the results from this discovery phase of research, further research will be conducted on specific sections of the application form.



## Goals

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Better understand why some Veterans choose to not apply for healthcare benefits.
- Better understand why Veterans start the application, but don’t complete it.
- Gain human understanding behind the sections that the analytics show high drop-off rates.
- Better understand context, environmental factors, and user behaviors, and feelings about the Health Care application.
- Run a general check of the application’s usability and the users’ understanding of the content and why they must provide the information that it asks for.



### Research questions

The research questions we want to address are: 

- What experiences (personal, social, and medical) bring the user to fill out the application?
  - What other places did the user consider/ turn to for healthcare (outside of the VA)?
- How well does the introduction prepare users to understand what they need in order to apply?
- Within the application form, what section(s) stop users from completing the form?
- Does the task analysis reflect similar drop-off points as the analytics?
- Why do financial sections have the highest drop-off rate?
  - Does the user understand why financial information must be provided?
- What outside factors does the current form overlook? 

Our hypothesis:

- Veterans don’t complete the form because they found a different source of health care (outside of the VA).
- Veterans don’t complete the form because they are unclear as to what information to provide in specific sections (mainly sections related to finances).
- Veterans don’t complete the form because they don’t have information readily available (mainly sections related to finances).
- Veterans don’t complete the form because they feel uncomfortable disclosing certain information.
- Online forms innately create different obstacles/less flexibility than paper/in-person experiences.



## Methodology 

### Task analysis + contextual interview
A task analysis with Veterans or Veteran POAs will be conducted remotely with Zoom. Remote observers and note-takers will be in attendance.
- Each Veteran task analysis will include a short contextual interview before and after to allow for open-ended discussion about specific sections and to gather further context.




## Participants and Recruitment
