## Background üèóÔ∏è

<details>
<summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>

### What problem is your product trying to solve?

The 10-10EZ form allows Veterans to apply for VA health care. This research aims to address potential friction points and optimize the user experience by exploring an alternative form pattern. The core problem is to ensure the application process is as clear, efficient, and user-friendly as possible, reducing abandonment rates and improving Veteran satisfaction.

### Where is your product situated on VA.gov?

This product is situated within the authenticated and unauthenticated pathways of VA.gov, specifically under **Health Care > Apply for health care**.

### What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool?

The 10-10EZ form is an existing and critical tool for Veterans. This research explores a significant iteration on its user interface pattern, moving from a traditional sequential flow to a task list/choose-your-own-adventure approach. Veterans will likely have some familiarity with the concept of filling out forms online, but this specific pattern may be new to them in the context of VA.gov.

## Research Goals ü•Ö

This study aims to evaluate two potential form patterns‚Äî**"Orange" task list** and **"Green" traditional flow**‚Äîfor the 10-10EZ health care application.

### Specific Goals:

- **Gauge Veteran Interest:** Understand Veterans' initial reactions and potential interest in both patterns.
- **Evaluate Navigation & Perceived Intuitiveness:** Determine how Veterans perceive ease of locating and initiating form sections.
- **Identify High-Level Points of Confusion:** Spot any early usability issues in the form structure and navigation.
- **Assess Initial Preference:** Identify which pattern Veterans prefer and why.
- **Gather Initial Qualitative Feedback:** Collect qualitative insights on both patterns' structure and clarity.

### Outcome
`How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?`

> _Note: This study will not cover full form completion, detailed field usability, or accessibility testing._

## Research Questions

1. What are Veterans' initial impressions of the Orange vs. Green form navigation?
2. How do they attempt to navigate and locate information in each pattern?
3. Which pattern feels easier or more intuitive‚Äîand why?
4. What high-level points of confusion arise during interaction?
5. Which pattern do Veterans prefer and what are the reasons?
6. What are their overall impressions and satisfaction levels with both designs?

> _Note: Accessibility and detailed usability questions will be addressed in future studies._

### Hypotheses (TBD)   

`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don‚Äôt skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

## Methodology 

**Type:** Unmoderated within-subjects study  
**Platform:** Optimal Workshop  
**Design:** Counterbalanced (each participant sees both prototypes, in varied order)

### Cohort Assignment:
- **Cohort 1:** Orange (Task List) first, then Green (Traditional Flow)
- **Cohort 2:** Green first, then Orange

Participants will be shown limited-functionality Figma prototypes and asked to perform exploratory navigation tasks, not full data entry. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected.

### Why this method?
- Allows direct pattern comparison.
- Reduces order bias via counterbalancing.
- Optimal Workshop is well-suited for this type of interaction and feedback capture.

### Location
This study will be remote and unmoderated, using Optimal Workshop.   

- [X] **Remote**
- [ ] **In-person**

## Recruitment üéØ   

### Recruitment approach (REVIEW)
Our intended audience is Veterans. We are looking at sample of the general population, who have not filled out the 10-10EZ in the last 6 months, so that we avoid too much familiarity with the health enrollment form structure.   

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:   
- Ideal completed sessions: 15 - 20
- Total participants: 20 - 26
- All participants will be Veterans   

**Target:** 20‚Äì25 Veterans (10‚Äì13 per cohort)  
**Tool:** Perigean  
**Device requirement:** Desktop/laptop only

### Primary Criteria (required):
- Must be a **Veteran**
- Comfortable with **online forms and websites**
- Must use **desktop or laptop**
- No online 10-10EZ completion in the **last 6 months**

### Secondary Criteria (mix desired):
- Diverse **age groups** (e.g., 25‚Äì34, 35‚Äì54, 55+)
- Mix of **genders**
- Mix of **tech comfort levels**
- Users with/without current **VA benefits**

> _Note: Accessibility testing is out of scope for this study but planned for future rounds._

## Timeline  üóìÔ∏è (TBD)   

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[Enter dates and times MM/DD HH:MM]**
- **Pilot Session** 
- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- We estimate each participant will need XX minutes to complete both of the flows.

### Availability
As these sessions are unmoderated, Veterans can complete them on their own time. We would like the final session to be completed by XX/XX/XXXX when the study closes.
