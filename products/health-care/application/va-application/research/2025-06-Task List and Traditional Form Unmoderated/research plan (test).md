## Background 

<details>
<summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>

### What problem is your product trying to solve?

The 10-10EZ form allows Veterans to apply for VA health care. This research aims to address potential friction points and optimize the user experience by exploring an alternative form pattern. The core problem is to ensure the application process is as clear, efficient, and user-friendly as possible, reducing abandonment rates and improving Veteran satisfaction.

### Where is your product situated on VA.gov?

This product is situated within the authenticated and unauthenticated pathways of VA.gov, specifically under **Health Care > Apply for health care**.

### What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool?

The 10-10EZ form is an existing and critical tool for Veterans. This research explores a significant iteration on its user interface pattern, moving from a traditional sequential flow to a task list/choose-your-own-adventure approach. Veterans will likely have some familiarity with the concept of filling out forms online, but this specific pattern may be new to them in the context of VA.gov.

## OCTO-DE Priorities

<details>
<summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support?</summary>

### Objective 1:
**VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.**

- **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
- **Key Result 2:** Reduce total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, toward a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.

### Objective 2:
**Veterans and their families can apply for, track, and manage their benefits and services in one centralized place.**

- **Key Result 1:** Digital experiences allow Veterans to complete their transactions and get their questions answered without needing to contact VA.

### Objective 3:
**Veterans and their families can easily find the information they need to make informed decisions about their benefits and services.**

- **Key Result 1:** Provide consistent, clear, and trustworthy information on VA.gov.

## Research Goals 

This study aims to evaluate two potential form patterns—**"Orange" task list** and **"Green" traditional flow**—for the 10-10EZ health care application.

### Specific Goals:

- **Gauge Veteran Interest:** Understand Veterans' initial reactions and potential interest in both patterns.
- **Evaluate Navigation & Perceived Intuitiveness:** Determine how Veterans perceive ease of locating and initiating form sections.
- **Identify High-Level Points of Confusion:** Spot any early usability issues in the form structure and navigation.
- **Assess Initial Preference:** Identify which pattern Veterans prefer and why.
- **Gather Initial Qualitative Feedback:** Collect qualitative insights on both patterns' structure and clarity.

> _Note: This study will not cover full form completion, detailed field usability, or accessibility testing._

## Research Questions

1. What are Veterans' initial impressions of the Orange vs. Green form navigation?
2. How do they attempt to navigate and locate information in each pattern?
3. Which pattern feels easier or more intuitive—and why?
4. What high-level points of confusion arise during interaction?
5. Which pattern do Veterans prefer and what are the reasons?
6. What are their overall impressions and satisfaction levels with both designs?

> _Note: Accessibility and detailed usability questions will be addressed in future studies._

## Methodology 

**Type:** Unmoderated within-subjects study  
**Platform:** Optimal Workshop  
**Design:** Counterbalanced (each participant sees both prototypes, in varied order)

### Cohort Assignment:
- **Cohort 1:** Orange (Task List) first, then Green (Traditional Flow)
- **Cohort 2:** Green first, then Orange

Participants will be shown limited-functionality Figma prototypes and asked to perform exploratory navigation tasks, not full data entry. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected.

### Why this method?
- Allows direct pattern comparison.
- Reduces order bias via counterbalancing.
- Optimal Workshop is well-suited for this type of interaction and feedback capture.

## Participants and Recruitment 

**Target:** 20–25 Veterans (10–13 per cohort)  
**Tool:** Perigean  
**Device requirement:** Desktop/laptop only

### Primary Criteria (required):
- Must be a **Veteran**
- Comfortable with **online forms and websites**
- Must use **desktop or laptop**
- No online 10-10EZ completion in the **last 6 months**

### Secondary Criteria (mix desired):
- Diverse **age groups** (e.g., 25–34, 35–54, 55+)
- Mix of **genders**
- Mix of **tech comfort levels**
- Users with/without current **VA benefits**

> _Note: Accessibility testing is out of scope for this study but planned for future rounds._

## Timeline 

- **Prototype finalization:** TBD
- **Study launch:** TBD
- **Data collection complete:** TBD
- **Synthesis complete:** TBD
- **Stakeholder readout:** TBD

## Team & Roles

- **Lead UX Researcher:** TBD  
- **Designer:** TBD  
- **Recruitment support:** Perigean  
- **Stakeholders:** TBD

---

## Success Metrics (TBD)

_Examples to consider:_

- Clear directional preference between patterns
- >X% of participants successfully complete initial navigation
- >Y% find at least one version intuitive and easy to use

---

## Risks & Mitigations  (TBD)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Limited fidelity may confuse users | Explain prototype limitations clearly |
| Sample too small for confidence | Aim for diverse representation across segments |

---

## Data Analysis Plan (TBD)

- Export and analyze **clickstream data** from Optimal Workshop
- **Thematic coding** of qualitative feedback (e.g., in Dovetail or similar tool)
- Compare navigation effectiveness and preference across cohorts

## Prototype Links (TBD)

- [Orange Prototype – Task List](#)
- [Green Prototype – Traditional Flow](#)
