## Research Goals
This study aimed to evaluate two potential form patterns — a task list pattern, the "Orange" prototype,  and a traditional flow, the "Green" prototype. These were tested on the 10-10EZ health care application to determine if there is potential to improve the form flow with a non-linear navigation. This research will help us determine if there is an opportunity to further investigate and  work on the task list experimental pattern.

This research supports Veterans in the "Getting Out," "Starting Up" (Attending to health needs - Moment that Matters), and "Taking Care of Myself" stages of their journey.



**Guiding Questions:**  

This study aims to evaluate two potential form patterns—"Orange" task list and "Green" traditional flow—for the 10-10EZ health care application to determine if there is potential to improve the form flow with a non-linear navigation.

**Specific Goals:**
- Gauge Veteran Interest: Understand Veterans' initial reactions to in both patterns, in a counter-balanced study, where each cohort will interact with both prototypes.
- Evaluate Navigation & Perceived Intuitiveness: Determine how Veterans perceive ease of locating and initiating form sections in both prototypes.
- Identify High-Level Points of Confusion: Spot any early usability issues in the task list structure and navigation.
- Assess Initial Preference: Identify which pattern Veterans prefer and why.
- Gather Initial Qualitative Feedback: Collect qualitative insights on both patterns' structure and clarity, with the focus on the non-linear pattern compared to the existing form.
 


## Research Questions
- What are Veterans' initial impressions of the Orange vs. Green form navigation?
- How do they attempt to navigate and locate information in each pattern?
- Which pattern feels easier or more intuitive—and why?
- What high-level points of confusion, if any, arise during interaction with the Orange and Green flows?
- After experiencing both flows, which pattern do Veterans prefer for navigating a healthcare application and what are the reasons?
- What are their overall impressions and satisfaction levels with both designs?

  

## Methodology 

**Type:** Unmoderated within-subjects study

**Platform:** Optimal Workshop using Figma prototypes

**Design:** Counterbalanced (each participant sees both prototypes, setup as 2 studies in Optimal Workshop switching the first placement order)

**Cohort Assignment:**
- Cohort 1: Orange (Task List) first, then Green (Traditional Flow)
- Cohort 2: Green first, then Orange

Participants were shown limited-functionality Figma prototypes and asked to perform exploratory navigation tasks, not full data entry. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected by both open-ended and closed-ended ranking questions. 



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

**Hypothesis Statement:** The non-linear task flow assists Veterans in completing the 10-10EZ.

- **"Maybe True"**:
- While the traditional flow was preferred by some participants, the task list showed promise for flexible navigation, especially for longer forms.
- Supporting evidence: Some participants appreciated the ability to skip around in the Orange prototype. Users may prefer to complete easier sections first and return to more complex ones later if additional information is needed.
  - 19 out of 43 participants reported the task-list prototype as their preference. (44.1%)
  - 17 out of 43 participants reported the traditional prototype as their preference. (39.5%)
  - 7 out of 43 had no preference (16.3%)





## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

> [!TIP] 
> Write findings as stand-alone insights that are easy to scan. For example:  
> - "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health.'"  
> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."  

[Example Key Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)

**1.** The task list (orange) prototype was slighlty more preferred by participants in the post-task question and ease-of-use rating

**2.** The traditional flow (green) prototype was preferred for its linear flow and easy of use.

**3.** 

**4.** Finding four

**5.** Finding five

**6.** Finding six

**7.** Finding seven

## Further research needed

**Accessibility testing with assistive technology users**
 - A Figma prototype was used which created restictions on being able to conduct sessions with an accessibiity focus. Will conduct testing with participants in this group in future studies where a coded prototype or staging environment can be leveraged.

**Interactivity of task list experience**
- The clickmaps showed that participants frequently clicked on the status label to try and navigate and the task list quick link in the blue navigation bar was also frequently used.

**Form user flows and disability rating impact**
- This test did not account for the Veteran segments that would result in a participant completing the entire form (including household financial information section) or the short form (disability rating over 50%).
