### Convo Guide / Task Instructions & Post-Questions

**Introductory Text for Participants (Common to both cohorts):**

"Thank you for participating in this study. We are exploring different ways to improve the online application process for VA health care on VA.gov. Today, we'd like you to imagine you are a Veteran applying for health care benefits using a new design concept. There are no right or wrong answers, and we are not testing your abilities. We are testing the designs.

This study will involve interacting with **two different prototype versions** of the health care application and answering a few questions after each, and then some comparison questions at the end. It should take approximately [30-40 minutes] to complete.

Ready to begin? Please click 'Continue' to start."

**Scenario (Common to both cohorts for both tasks):**

"Imagine you are a Veteran who recently separated from military service and you want to apply for VA health care benefits. You've heard that applying online is the easiest way.

Your goal for this task is to explore this application prototype and try to navigate to and identify where you would enter your **personal information**, **military service details**, and **insurance information**. You don't need to actually fill out the forms, just navigate to those sections and get a feel for the structure.

**Task Instructions for Cohort 1 - Task 1 (Orange Pattern):**

"You will now explore the **Orange** prototype. This is a new approach to the application. Please click on the link below to open the prototype. Once it loads, please begin to navigate and understand where you would enter your information.

**Prototype Link (Orange - Task List):** [PROTOTYPE LINK]

When you have finished exploring this prototype and feel you understand its navigation for the specified sections, please return to this survey.

**Post-Task Questions for Cohort 1 - After Task 1 (Orange Pattern):**

1.  What was your initial impression of the **Orange** prototype's navigation and layout?
2.  How easy or difficult was it to find the sections for personal information, military service details, and insurance information in the **Orange** prototype? (Scale: 1-Very Difficult to 7-Very Easy)
3.  What did you like most about the **Orange** prototype's navigation?
4.  What did you find most confusing or challenging about the **Orange** prototype's navigation?
5.  If you had to describe the **Orange** prototype to a friend, what would you say?

**Task Instructions for Cohort 1 - Task 2 (Green Pattern):**

Now, you will explore a different approach to the application, the **Green** prototype, which is more similar to the existing VA.gov application flow. Please click on the link below to open this prototype. Once it loads, please navigate and try to understand where you would enter your information.

**Prototype Link (Green - Traditional Flow):** 

When you have finished exploring this prototype and feel you understand its navigation for the specified sections, please return to this survey.

**Final Comparative Post-Task Questions (Common to both cohorts, asked after *both* prototypes have been experienced):**

1.  Now that you've experienced both the **Orange** (task list) prototype and the **Green** (traditional flow) prototype, which approach do you think would be easier or more intuitive for a Veteran to use when applying for VA health care?
    * The **Orange** (task list) prototype
    * The **Green** (traditional flow) prototype
    * No preference / They are equally good/bad
2.  Please explain why you chose that option. What specific aspects did you like or dislike about each design pattern?
3.  Based on your experience with both prototypes, if you were applying for VA health care today, which style of form would you prefer to complete?
    * The **Orange** (task list) style
    * The **Green** (traditional flow) style
    * No preference
4.  Why would you prefer that style?
5.  Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience with these two health care application prototypes?
