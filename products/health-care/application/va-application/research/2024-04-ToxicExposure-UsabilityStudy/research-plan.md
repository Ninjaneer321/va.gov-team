# Research Plan for [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, April 2024] - Toxic Exposure Questions Usability Study

## Background
- Questions regarding toxic exposure were added to the online 10-10EZ form following the PACT act. This research will test the implementation of those questions within the online form.
- These questions provide a place on the 10-10EZ health care application for Veterans to identify whether they have experienced exposure to toxic materials during their active duty. This can help Veterans who may not qualify for VA health care or those that have a low Priority Group (7 or 8) get into a Priority Group 6 and receive additional care.
- The 10-10EZ Health care application can be completed both unauthenticated and authenticated. Some information can be prefilled for authenticated users but these new toxic exposure questions are not prefilled.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.


### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
- From starting up to aging, these questions fit into the Veteran journey.

Are there moments that matter? 
- The moments that matter are when Veterans are selecting the health care coverage according to their needs - whether that is supplemental coverage as things change in their lives or service connected or non-service connected needs.


## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 



### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
- This research will help evaluate the content clarity and Veteran impressions around the newly added questions in the military service section for toxic exposure. Thus guiding what might need further clarification or edits and providing data on what is working well.

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Methodology	
We will be conducting 1 hour remote usability testing where we will ask the participants to complete the 10-10EZ form given the option of doing so authenticated with their own login or unauthenticated. 


### Location
Remote, moderated via Zoom.

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.  

For moderated usability tests: 
- [Link to conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/2024-04-ToxicExposure-UsabilityStudy/conversation-guide.md)
- [Will be testing in staging and/or production]
- [Figma source of truth desigsn](https://www.figma.com/file/UljiHam46o5DItC5iDgmPd/10-10EZ?type=design&node-id=0-7191&mode=design&t=LvwA2lRcEckp8H13-0)

## Recruitment	


### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research are Veterans and we will be utilizing Perigean to recruit participants.
  

### Recruitment criteria
**Veterans: 9 Requested / 6 Completed**

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]


**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
* Maximum Sessions per day: 2
