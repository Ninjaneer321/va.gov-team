# Research Plan for [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, April 2024] - Toxic Exposure Questions Usability Study

## Background
- Questions regarding toxic exposure were added to the online 10-10EZ form following the PACT act. This research will test the implementation of those questions within the online form.
- These questions provide a place on the 10-10EZ health care application for Veterans to identify whether they have experienced exposure to toxic materials during their active duty. This can help Veterans who may not qualify for VA health care or those that have a low Priority Group (7 or 8) get into a Priority Group 6 and receive additional care.
- The 10-10EZ Health care application can be completed both unauthenticated and authenticated. Some information can be prefilled for authenticated users but these new toxic exposure questions are not prefilled.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

2024 Priorities:


### Veteran Journey
This research fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) as several stages including:
- Starting up
- Taking care of my self
- Retiring
- Aging

- The **moments that matter** are when Veterans are selecting the health care coverage according to their needs - whether that is supplemental coverage as things change in their lives or service connected or non-service connected needs.


## Research Goals	

- **Goal 1: Discover areas where the content may not be clear or need additional explanation.**

- **Goal 2: Discover areas where their service history requires too much mental lift / recall on the Veterans behalf to answer.**

- **Goal 3: Discover unknown usability or accessibility issues**


### Outcome
- This research will help evaluate the content clarity and Veteran impressions around the newly added questions in the military service section for toxic exposure. Thus guiding what might need further clarification or edits and providing data on what is working well.

### Research questions
**Goal 1: Discover areas where the content may not be clear or need additional explanation.**
- Do Veterans mention the dates missing or that they would be helpful?
- is it preferred to have this question as optional, can skip or to be given an explicit I don't know option
- 


### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Methodology	
We will be conducting 1 hour remote usability testing where we will ask the participants to complete the 10-10EZ form given the option of doing so authenticated with their own login or unauthenticated. 


### Location
Remote, moderated via Zoom.

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research are Veterans and we will be utilizing Perigean to recruit participants.
  

### Recruitment criteria
- **Veterans: 9 Requested / 6 Completed**

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

- Are you currently enrolled in VA health care? [answer should be no to qualify.]

[Screener question]
- 1 completed session with a screen reader user


**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- Mixture of other demographics; no more than 2 per category
  

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.
