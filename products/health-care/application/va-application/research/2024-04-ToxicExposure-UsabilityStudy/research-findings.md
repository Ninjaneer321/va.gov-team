## Research Goals
_First, set the context of this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey. Explain what a Veteran might do before and after using this tool. What moments does this tool live in? Are there moments that matter to keep in mind? What are Veteran’s familiarity with tools like this? (do they use tools like this, or is this something new)._
_[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)_

_Then, describe your goals for this research_

- Goal 1: Discover areas where the content may not be clear or need additional explanation
- Goal 2: Discover areas where their service history requires too much mental lift / recall on the Veterans behalf to answer
- Goal 3: Discover unknown usability or accessibility issues



## Research Questions

**Goal 1: Discover areas where the content may not be clear or need additional explanation**
- Are there any questions where the Veteran says additional info would be helpful?
- Do Veterans mention the dates missing or that they would be helpful?
- Is it preferred that questions are optional, can be skipped, or to be given an explicit "I don't know" option?
- Is something more than content needed to help Veterans answer these service questions? (A link or a map for example)

**Goal 2: Discover areas where their service history requires too much mental lift / recall on the Veteran's behalf to answer**
- Do Veterans feel they should be providing this information or is this information they feel the VA should already have?
- What types of information do Veterans expect the VA to have access to?
- Do Veterans want the option to upload digital documents or proof of their exposures?
- How difficult or easy will it be for Veterans to recall or look up specific service dates and/or find supporting documentation to upload?

**Goal 3: Discover unknown usability or accessibility issues**
- Are there any accessibility issues with the bulleted list format of some questions? We're curious specifically for the extensive list on the Gulf War locations page.
- Do on-field error messages often occur? If so, are Veterans struggling with the messaging to get errors resolved?


## Methodology 

We conducted about hour-long **moderated remote usability sessions** from April 1-5, 2024. 
- 10-10EZ Form in Production on VA.gov
- Unauthenticated or authenticated via the partipants account and ability

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#methodology)_


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

#### We assume... some might have issues recalling the places/dates they served with how the questions are worded.
- Likeyly True


#### We assume... Veterans expectations around the toxic expsoure questions is that the VA should already have their service history information.
- Maybe True

#### We assume... some Veterans might want additional explanatory visuals such as maps or links to help them with quicker recall of these service location questions.
- Likey False


## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._
