## Research Goals
These questions provide a place on the 10-10EZ health care application for Veterans to identify whether they have experienced exposure to toxic materials during their active duty. This can help Veterans who may not qualify for VA health care or those that have a low Priority Group (7 or 8) get into a Priority Group 6 and receive additional care.

The moments that matter within the Veteran Journey are when Veterans are selecting the health care coverage according to their needs - whether that is supplemental coverage as things change in their lives or service connected or non-service connected needs.

- Goal 1: Discover areas where the **content may not be clear or need additional explanation**
- Goal 2: Discover areas where their **service history requires too much mental lift / recall** on the Veterans behalf to answer
- Goal 3: Discover **unknown usability or accessibility issues**



## Research Questions

**Goal 1: Discover areas where the content may not be clear or need additional explanation**
- Are there any questions where the Veteran says additional info would be helpful?
- Do Veterans mention the dates missing or that they would be helpful?
- Is it preferred that questions are optional, can be skipped, or to be given an explicit "I don't know" option?
- Is something more than content needed to help Veterans answer these service questions? (A link or a map for example)

**Goal 2: Discover areas where their service history requires too much mental lift / recall on the Veteran's behalf to answer**
- Do Veterans feel they should be providing this information or is this information they feel the VA should already have?
- What types of information do Veterans expect the VA to have access to?
- Do Veterans want the option to upload digital documents or proof of their exposures?
- How difficult or easy will it be for Veterans to recall or look up specific service dates and/or find supporting documentation to upload?

**Goal 3: Discover unknown usability or accessibility issues**
- Are there any accessibility issues with the bulleted list format of some questions? We're curious specifically for the extensive list on the Gulf War locations page.
- Do on-field error messages often occur? If so, are Veterans struggling with the messaging to get errors resolved?


## Methodology 

We conducted about hour-long **moderated remote usability sessions** from April 1-5, 2024. 
- 10-10EZ Form in Production on VA.gov
- Unauthenticated or authenticated via the partipants account and ability


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

#### We assume... some might have issues recalling the places/dates they served with how the questions are worded.
- Somewhat true.


#### We assume... Veterans expectations around the toxic expsoure questions is that the VA should already have their service history information.
- Somewhat true.

#### We assume... some Veterans might want additional explanatory visuals such as maps or links to help them with quicker recall of these service location questions.
- Likely false.


## Key Findings

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)_

1. <b>Most Veterans have been or believe they have been exposed to toxic materials in the military, but they don't know if it qualifies as "toxic exposure."</b>
- 7 out of 7 Veterans expressed confusion about whether certain types of potential toxic exposure count or are what VA would define and classify as "toxic exposure."
- 6 out of 7 said they would want more information or explanation on something within the toxic exposure questions.

Key quotes:
 > P3: "I don't know how you would classify that something was toxic or not. In the military you're always running into something that's toxic."
> P9: "I probably would've specified asbestos if I had more information of where it applied to, like in general facilities where you stayed or anything asbestos-related. [It would be more clear if] maybe they gave examples of where it might be."
