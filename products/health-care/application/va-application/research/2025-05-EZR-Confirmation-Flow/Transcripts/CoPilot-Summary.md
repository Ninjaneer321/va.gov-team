# Confirmation Flow Research Summary

## P1
- The participant found the VA.gov update flow very familiar and straightforward, noting that both the design (color, font) and process matched their past experiences with the site.
- Pre-filled information made the process quick and effortless; the user emphasized that, as long as the information is correct, they could proceed rapidly through the steps.
- Elements like the option to save progress were appreciated, especially in situations where the process might be interrupted.
- The participant expected intuitive and standard options (e.g., “single,” “divorced”) when changing personal status information, and anticipated that changes would be saved automatically.
- No sections were found confusing; the user rated the task as "very easy" (1 out of 5 on a difficulty scale).
The participant mentioned that, while they personally found the flow easy, many other veterans struggle with the initial account creation rather than the actual update process.
- For their own use case (no taxable income), the participant would expect to leave fields blank or enter zeros, and noted that the system should accept this.
- The process was described as much easier and more convenient than older methods (e.g., calling or leaving voicemails).
- The only suggestion or concern raised was about font size on mobile devices, where smaller text can be harder to read.

Overall, the feedback is that the confirmation/update flow is clear, familiar, and easy to use, especially for returning users with pre-filled data. The main suggestion for improvement is to consider better font sizing for mobile users.

## P2
**General Flow and Familiarity**
- The participant found the process familiar and straightforward, with most steps being easy to understand and complete.
- The flow generally matched expectations for updating personal and financial information.

**Navigation and UI Feedback**
- Clear ability to update personal information was appreciated.
- Saving progress and finishing the form later was valued.
- Screen progression indicators ("1 of 3", "2 of 3") should update intuitively after hitting "continue."
- The presence of a "back" button was helpful.
- "Home phone" field felt outdated but understandable.

**Marital Status and Dependents**
- When changing marital status, the participant expected to be prompted for relevant follow-up information (e.g., date of divorce or death), as this affects benefits.
- Logical, context-sensitive follow-up questions were expected.
- The limit of “up to 6” dependents stood out but was not an issue for this user.
- Clearer handling was suggested for cases where a dependent is deceased or no longer qualifies.

**Form Logic and Data Pre-Population**
- The participant wanted to review currently stored information before being asked if there are changes to income or deductions.
- Found it inefficient to re-enter unchanged information; suggested a “No Change” option or pre-population of fields with last year’s data.
- Auto-filling previous information if unchanged was seen as highly desirable.

**Timeouts and Saving Progress**
- The option to save and finish the form later was valued, especially for sections requiring more time (like financial details).
- A visible countdown timer or warning was suggested if the session is set to time out, especially for short inactivity windows.

**Clarity and Information**
- Brief explanations for form sections (such as why certain information is asked) were appreciated.
- For some fields (e.g., “enrolled in school”), the participant wanted more context or explanation about what qualifies.

**Overall Impression**
- The process was clear and largely intuitive.
- Main suggestions centered on reducing redundant data entry, improving step transitions, and making timeouts transparent.
- No parts of the flow were confusing; feedback was practical and focused on streamlining the user experience.

**Summary of Suggestions:**
- Make step progression (“1 of 3”, etc.) update more intuitively.
- Allow users to review current data before being asked about changes.
- Provide a “No Change” or auto-fill option for unchanged data.
- Clarify requirements for fields like “enrolled in school” and handling of dependents.
- Display a timer or warning before session timeout.
- Continue supporting the ability to save and finish later.
