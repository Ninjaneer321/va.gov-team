# Confirmation Flow Research Summary

## P1
- The participant found the VA.gov update flow very familiar and straightforward, noting that both the design (color, font) and process matched their past experiences with the site.
- Pre-filled information made the process quick and effortless; the user emphasized that, as long as the information is correct, they could proceed rapidly through the steps.
- Elements like the option to save progress were appreciated, especially in situations where the process might be interrupted.
- The participant expected intuitive and standard options (e.g., “single,” “divorced”) when changing personal status information, and anticipated that changes would be saved automatically.
- No sections were found confusing; the user rated the task as "very easy" (1 out of 5 on a difficulty scale).
The participant mentioned that, while they personally found the flow easy, many other veterans struggle with the initial account creation rather than the actual update process.
- For their own use case (no taxable income), the participant would expect to leave fields blank or enter zeros, and noted that the system should accept this.
- The process was described as much easier and more convenient than older methods (e.g., calling or leaving voicemails).
- The only suggestion or concern raised was about font size on mobile devices, where smaller text can be harder to read.

Overall, the feedback is that the confirmation/update flow is clear, familiar, and easy to use, especially for returning users with pre-filled data. The main suggestion for improvement is to consider better font sizing for mobile users.
