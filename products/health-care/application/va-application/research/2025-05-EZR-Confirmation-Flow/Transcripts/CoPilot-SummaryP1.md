# Usability Study & Prototype Validation Summary

## Participant Background
- 100% permanently disabled veteran, familiar with VA.gov, recently used the site for messaging about an ER visit.
- Has experience updating personal information on VA.gov.

---

## Prototype Validation & Usability Themes

### Prototype Familiarity and Visual Design
- Participant found the prototype visually familiar and consistent with previous VA.gov experiences.
- Color, font, and overall look and feel matched user expectations, contributing to a sense of trust.

**Possible Product Updates:**  
- Continue using established VA.gov design patterns for consistency.
- Ensure changes do not disrupt returning users’ expectations of look and feel.

---

### Flow and Task Completion (Option Green)
- Flow was described as straightforward, quick, and “effortless,” especially with pre-filled information.
- The ability to save progress was noted as valuable.
- Participant confidently navigated sections for marital status, dependents, and financial information, making logical assumptions about expected interactions (e.g., expecting options like “single,” “divorced”).
- Would enter “0” for taxable income if it applied, and appreciated the simplicity of not needing to update irrelevant fields.

**Possible Product Updates:**  
- Retain and emphasize pre-filled information and save-progress features.
- Clarify instructions or labels for fields that may not apply to all users, especially in scenarios where "no change" is common.
- Ensure option lists (e.g., marital status) match user expectations and mental models.

---

### Scenario Flexibility and Realism
- Scenario (married, with a dependent) did not match the participant’s real-life situation, but they adapted to the role-play.
- Participant indicated the process would be even faster if their actual information was used.

**Possible Product Updates:**  
- When possible, personalize form flows and scenarios based on actual user data to reduce irrelevant steps and increase speed.
- Add clear explanation or context when using test or role-play data in user-facing scenarios.

---

### Overall Difficulty and Satisfaction
- Participant rated the process as “1” (very easy) on a 1-5 scale.
- No parts of the process were confusing; participant enjoyed the streamlined, modern experience compared to past VA processes.
- Positive feedback on being able to complete updates without needing to contact VA by phone.

**Possible Product Updates:**  
- Promote and further refine ease-of-use improvements, ensuring the update process remains fast and intuitive.
- Continue to test with users of different digital skill levels to maintain broad accessibility.

## Out-of-Context Insights

- **Account Creation as a Barrier:** Participant said many veterans struggle with account creation/authentication, but once inside VA.gov, the experience is easy. This suggests onboarding and sign-in are potential friction points.
- **Mobile Usability:** The participant’s experience highlights the ongoing need for optimizing all flows for mobile, not just desktop.
- **Font Size and Accessibility:** Font size, especially on mobile, was noted as a concern, indicating a need for continued attention to accessibility standards.
