# Feb 12, 2024 | 10-10 team<>Product Lead - Bi-weekly touchbase


- Notes
     - **Patrick**
          - Update on VES
               - No update
               - Waiting for confirmation from VES on receiving a flag/indicator to trigger a manual workflow - April 1st?
          - Reached out to see if this is statutory thing, or if we can push out to April
          - People are starting to talk about how expanded eligibility starts March 5th
               - Dots did not connect between policy & implementation groups until a few weeks ago
          - Main concern is expansion of eligibility is the first time there is a very clear path to apply for health care without getting a disability rating
               - Usually the process is to file, get rating, apply to VHA, get PG, get care
               - This expansion allows Veterans to skip compensation and just get care
               - If not available online, then the announcement goes out but they can’t apply
               - Not a good look to store and not actually go anywhere yet, but it is the only best option to at least make it available online
               - Could guide Veterans to file paper forms if they want to indicate TERA
     - **Kristen**
          - Eventually will be in VISTA in Environmental factors
               - Does it impact TES reminder, etc
               - Meeting with Toxic group on Friday
     - **Patrick**
          - We may be able to send a True/false flag in April
               - Deliver April (actual date TBD)
               - Send flag that TERA question is Yes or No
               - Figure out a way to get the data to the processor (JSON, PDF, etc)
               - Possibly follow up via HEC call to Veteran if data cant go to VES
          - HEC/VES
               - Needs to figure out how to make this a digital option
               - HEC needs to put pressure on VES
                    - If they want Delivery 3/5
               - Let’s check in on Wednesday morning to see where we are on this
                    - Determine what to discuss with 
          - Decision made to deliver this in March
               - White House directed - decided we are doing this in March
          - 60-day limitation
               - Don’t spend too much time on this
               - A week/couple weeks is the thought here
               - Definitely do not want to make this a longer solution
     - **Hieu**
          - Presented screen number impacts to the Veteran for EZR and EZ
     - **Patrick**
          - Submitting the application
               - Store only 
               - Then submit with TERA data when VES is ready
                    - Need to determine how we can do this
          - March 5th 
               - If VES does not have a plan, we will not release as we do not/can not want to hold data indefinitely
               - We do not want to store the data for more than a couple weeks
               - If someone comes out with a plan to get data to VES in a shorter timeframe, we will not be ready by 3/5 and will communicate that
           - Future state expectation - Prefill
               - Prefill from 526ez
               - There is appetite for making this more seamless between VBA and VHA

               
- **Next Steps**:
     - Keep working on VA.Gov DB solution. The chances of a 60+ day hold in a VA.Gov DB seem slim to none so we don't need to worry about that at this point.
     - Stay agile and await further instructions on implementation (VA.Gov DB, VES TERA flag, launch date, etc.)
     - Follow up with VES team on
          - A) Figuring out how to get data from VA.Gov DB to VES,
          - B) Sending over TERA/No TERA Flag,
          - C) Sending over Tera/No TERA Flag and TERA question data
     - Come up with workflow that directs Veteran to filling our EZ PDF (as discussed above)
     - Continue investigating ways to push/pull data to/from VBA (this is part of the longer term solution)
     - Come up with HEC Agenda (we'll know more about what they know tomorrow)
