# Feb 12, 2024 | 10-10 team<>Product Lead - Bi-weekly touchbase


- Notes
     - Patrick
          - Update on VES
               - No update
               - Waiting for confirmation from VES on receiving a flag/indicator to trigger a manual workflow - April 1st?
          - Reached out to see if this is statutory thing, or if we can push out to April
          - People are starting to talk about how expanded eligibility starts March 5th
               - Use TERA on EZ
               - Not available until summer
               - Everyone looked at each other
          - Dots did not connect between policy people and implementation people until a few weeks ago
               - Unfortunately BAU for how VA works
          - Main concern is expansion of eligibility is the first time there is a very clear path to apply for health care without getting a disability rating
               - Usually file, get rating, apply to VHA, get PG, get care
               - This expansion allows Veterans to skip compensation and just get care
               - If not available, then the announcement goes out but they can’t apply
               - Not a good look to store and not actually go anywhere yet, but it is the only best option to at least make it available online
               - Could guide Veterans to file paper forms if they want to indicate TERA
     - Kristen
          - Eventually will be in VISTA in Environmental factors
               - Does it impact TES reminder, etc
               - Meeting with Toxic group on Friday
     - Patrick
          - HEC - True/false flag in April
               - Deliver April ??
               - Send flag
               - Figure out a way to get the data to the processor
               - Possibly follow up via call if data cant go
          - Need to figure out how to make this a digital option
          - Put pressure on VES
               - Delivery 3/5
          - 60-day limitation
               - Don’t spend too much time on this
               - A week/couple weeks is the thought here
               - Definitely do not want to make this a longer solution
          - Go-forward plan
               - Store in VA.gov db
               - Build Yes/No
                    - Consider plan on sending data to VES for manual processing
          - HEC
               - Let’s check in on Wednesday morning to see where we are on this
               - Determine what to discuss with 
          - Decision made to deliver this in March
               - White House directed - decided we are doing this in March
     - Hieu presented screen number impacts to the Veteran for EZR and EZ
     - Patrick
          - Expectation 
               - Prefill from 526?
               - There is appetite for making this more seamless between VBA and VHA
          - Submitting the application
               - Store only 
               - Then submit with TERA data
          - March 5th 
               - If VES does not have a plan, we will not release
               - We do not want to store the data for more than a couple weeks
               - If someone comes out with a plan to get data to VES in a shorter timeframe, we will not be ready and will communicate that.
