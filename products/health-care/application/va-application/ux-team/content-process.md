# [WIP - DRAFT] Content Process

- EXPERIMENT WIP - CG update steps listed below 



### Content Tickets
Open a content ticket if this is part of the Collab Cycle or not

LINK HERE - CAIA intake request
NEW - Created end of April, Content 


## Figma file setup:
1. Create the “Content Sections” for what needs reviewed and make sure to have the native content components created elsewhere outside of where content will be making edits
	- Label and change the color of these sections in Figma so it is clear that is the content working area
2. For each screen/page place a note component to add helpful name and context
3. For each screen/frame that needs to be reviewed place content status component(s) next to EACH screen/frame needing content collaboration
4. Add detailed notes or items to focus on that was changed or is for review and any potentially helpful background context to the notes.
- This can also be used to track the latest status updates of why a screen is still in Pending.


### Content Status Component
10-10 EZ & EZR FormContent > MISC > Content Status

**Variants to use:**
- When ready for Content to review - RED
- When ready for Development - GREEN
- When pending - in process/SME questions/etc- YELLOW
- General notes: BLUE

### Additional Notes Component
Use the Notes component in VADS Web Annotation Kit 
- To label each screen / page name of the flow for review
- Callout any other changing elements like URLs/fields added or removed/specific changes



## Process experiment: 

1. Designer setup FIGMA page with all components and notes to start content collab 
2. Designer/PM open CAIA ticket 
3. Designer walk through the request and the screens in Figma at a weekly Friday content sync meeting 
4. Content can adjust in content section Figma screens directly or post temporary questions in Figma comments
5. As content updates are reviewed and decided to incorporate, designer make sure to update in source of truth section of Figma page
6. Capture any future state comments or content in the content status component note variant
7. Can change color of note or content components to call out SME questions and answers (chat as team on future direction)
8. When in Pending used details section to add reasoning why
9. Change to ready to development as pages are approved
10. Tag engineer in FE ticket once designs/content are approved
