# Template - UX Documentation

---

Goal: create a "template" but more of a menu to select and remove from per project. The "template" portion to copy over is setup at the bottom of this document.


----

## How-to reference
- For every initiative / project, PM will create a folder to house relevant documentation. Create a "UX" folder and readme.md file
- Add the key documention elements to the readme file



## Key documentation elements
- Background summary
- Current state
- Recent artifacts + deliverables
- Timeline + UX decisions
- Tickets
- Key findings + next steps


----

### Background summary
- Where to cover the **problem statement** and the product intiative brief details and/or links.
- Once the project is compelted, add the **solution description** as well.
- Add links to any helpful high-level project information, initiative briefs, github folders or roadmaps. 

### Current state
- A high level summary of what phase the project is in - discovery, design, content, development, research, etc. Once release, add relase date or incremental schedule (can be found/copied from epic or initiative brief documentation)
