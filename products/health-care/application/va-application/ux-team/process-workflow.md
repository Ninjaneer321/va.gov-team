# Design Decisions and Workflow

## Ticket Process

### Ticket Creation
- Ticket creation is not exclusive to PMs - Anyone on the team can create a ticket!
- A ticket should include:
  - Background: Why we are doing this work and any important context
  - Benefit to the Veteran: To continually base our work around user-centered outcomes
  - Resource links: Anything the assignee might need to reference in order to complete the ticket
  - Tasks: A checklist of action items that must be completed before closing the ticket
  - Acceptance criteria: The definition of done for the ticket. This criteria must be met before closing the ticket.

## Team / PM / PO decisions
## Collab and/or CAIA review 
## Stakeholder / SME accuracy checks
## Development review
## QA with content/design/research
