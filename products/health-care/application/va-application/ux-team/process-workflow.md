# Design Decisions and Workflow


<summary> ## Ticket Process </summary>
  <details>
### Ticket Creation
- Ticket creation is not exclusive to PMs - Anyone on the team can create a ticket!
- A ticket should include:
  - Background: Why we are doing this work and any important context
  - Benefit to the Veteran: To continually base our work around user-centered outcomes
  - Resource links: Anything the assignee might need to reference in order to complete the ticket
  - Tasks: A checklist of action items that must be completed before closing the ticket
  - Acceptance criteria: The definition of done for the ticket. This criteria must be met before closing the ticket.
- Refer to the team's [definition of ready](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v32urMBT9IU7BBZHuLJN3Tap4dTTxSlbxQ38dFWtpYg/edit#slide=id.g2b7676c8a1f_0_0) before starting work on a ticket

### Ticket Refinement and Pointing
- Tickets should be refined prior to being pointed
  - If you're unsure of ticket content and completeness, either have the team review it async via Slack or in biweekly backlog refinement  
- Tickets should be pointed prior to being self-assigned
  - Refer to the team's [guidelines on how to point tickets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v32urMBT9IU7BBZHuLJN3Tap4dTTxSlbxQ38dFWtpYg/edit#slide=id.g2652fddd673_0_311)
- Optional but helpful tip: Put initials next to tasks indicating who will complete them if there are multiple assignees to one ticket

### Working On and Completing a Ticket
- Check off task items in the ticket as you complete them so all team members are aware of progress
- Leave comments on tickets to convey decisions made and/or artifacts created that are relevant to the ticket
- Refer to the team's guidelines for [definition of done](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v32urMBT9IU7BBZHuLJN3Tap4dTTxSlbxQ38dFWtpYg/edit#slide=id.g2330c998e95_0_5) before closing a ticket
