## How we work 


### Processes




### Tools used


#### Figma 
Where screen designs and prototypes can be created.   
- [Link to Health Enorllment Project Room](https://www.figma.com/files/team/1278375444205744118/project/175597680/Healthcare-Benefits-Applications?fuid=1070808939264105970)

- Files separated by Product, Shared Content and Archive

**Organization**
- The pages listed at the top under the _Source of Truth_ section header should always match what is in production
- Under the _Work + Tickets_ header, include a short name and the ticket number when naming the page.

#### Mural 
Used for research synthesis, source of truth and work-in-progess user flows and other collaboration needs. 

- [1010 Room](https://app.mural.co/invitation/room/1670613238628?code=a67c337f0cd645d18b1b99d77f3743e1&sender=uadf1ed7fe7c76f0914967329)


#### Github 

**Folders**
- For each new initiative/epic, the Project Manager will create a folder in our github product folder
- Designers will add a ux folder and a readme.md file for each initiative that has a UX impact
- Keep relevant links to artifacts and tickets organized here

- Add a decion log file (or should this be on the readme file, just a new header/section?)


**Tickets**
- Add a link to all the relevant UX tickets from the UX readme.md file
- In the Figma file, create a documentation box and add links to relevant tickets there as well
