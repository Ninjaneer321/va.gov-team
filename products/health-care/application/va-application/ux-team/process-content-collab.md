## Designer Figma file setup

When an initiative needs to go through content collaboration process, the design file needs to be structured in a way to allow the content specialist to make edits directly in Figma. To prevent issues with changing variants of the main native components, create a set of content components just for this initative/ticket. 


1. Create the “Content Source of Truth” Section in Figma for the main content symbols
2. Create the frame and turn into a component each page/question needing content collaboration
3. Annotate and add notes and background to the components
5. Create a Section in Figma for each part of the form involved in the work
6. For **each** screen/frame that needs to be reviewed place content status component(s) setting to "Ready for content review"
