# Registration Only - Experiment proposal

## Problem statement
- Veterans do not have a pathway to register for VA health care online.

## Goal of this experiment
- Determine whether there is a need for a registration pathway on the online 10-10EZ

## Potential constraints & risks
- Registration for VA health care is not clearly defined
- Registration is often performed at a facility in person


## Implementation
- For Veterans with 40% or lower disability rating, the 10-10EZ will prompt them within the application asking whether they want to seek care for their service-connected disability/injury only or enroll in VA health care for full benefits. If they choose service-connected care only, we will display an on-screen message directing them to call the Health Eligibility & Enrollment center, download the PDF form and mail in or visit a facility to register for service-connected care.
     - The Veteran will have the option to go back within the application and make a different selection to proceed through the application for VA health care enrollment

## Hypothesis
- By providing the option to register, we believe ....
- EXAMPLE: At least X% of Veterans will select Registration, and when presented with the options (call, print/mail, in-person), they will exit the form (assuming to do one of those things)


## Timetable
- The experiment will run for 3 months (90 days)

### Targets
|Timeblock|# of application starts|# of selection page views|# of Registration selection|# of 'Back' button clicks|# of form exits after Registration selection|# of clicks to print 10-10EZ form|
|---------|---------------|-------------|----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Monthly Average | x | x | x | x |x | x |
| 3-month Total | x | x | x | x |x | x |

### Results
|Timeblock|# of application starts|# of selection page views|# of Registration selection|# of 'Back' button clicks|# of form exits after Registration selection|# of clicks to print 10-10EZ form|

|Month 1| x | x | x | x |x | x |
|Month 2| x | x | x | x |x | x |
|Month 3| x | x | x | x |x | x |

## Conclusion
- ...
- EXAMPLE: Based on the results, we see that X% of Veterans have shown interest in the registration pathway.  This proves/disproves our hypothesis


## Next Steps
- ...
- EXAMPLE: Now that we have determined X, we will do this thing next.
