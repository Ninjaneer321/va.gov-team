# Registration Only - Experiment proposal

## Problem statement
Veterans do not have a pathway to register for VA health care online.

## Goal of this experiment
- Determine whether there is a need for a registration pathway on the online 10-10EZ

## Potential constraints & risks
- Registration for VA health care is not clearly defined
- Registration is often performed at a facility in person


## Implementation
- For Veterans with 40% or lower disability rating, the 10-10EZ will prompt them within the application asking whether they want to seek care for their service-connected disability/injury only or enroll in VA health care for full benefits. If they choose service-connected care only, we will display an on-screen message directing them to call the Health Eligibility & Enrollment center, download the PDF form and mail in or visit a facility to register for service-connected care.
     - The Veteran will have the option to go back within the application and make a different selection to proceed through the application for VA health care enrollment

## Hypothesis


## Timetable
- The experiment will run for 3 months (90 days)


|Timeblock|# of Registration selection|# of 'Back' button clicks|# of form exits after Registration selection|
|---------|---------------|----------|---------------|
|Month 1| x | x | x |
|Month 2| x | x | x |
|Month 3| x | x | x |
| Total | x | x | x |

## Expected outcomes
- There will not be a high interest in registering for specific VA health care online.

## Next Steps
- ...
