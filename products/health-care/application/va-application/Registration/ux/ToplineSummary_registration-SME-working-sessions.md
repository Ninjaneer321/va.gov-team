## Summary

### Service Connected 

**Finding #1 - There is a process in the works to "register" Veterans in VHA when they first apply for a disabilty claim.**

- Follow up with HEC stakeholders on knoweldege of timing of this change
- How will this impact their process / systems?
- How will this impact Veteran enrollment statuses?


**Finding #2 - Marketplace Insurnce Impact**

- For Veterans with a disability rating over 50%, choosing between Registration or Enrollment impacts them depending on if they also have marketplace insurance.
- The ACA issue --- if a Veteran has a secondary Marketplace insurance they can lose benefits if they are enrolled (and not registered) in VA health care 

> Due to ACA, Registered can be seen and not impact on the marketplace. If you are Enrolled, you received a stipend due to low income, you’ll get a penalty for Enrollment”


**Finding #3 - Service Connected Under 50% need to submit financials to enroll**

- If 'REGISTERED" does the Veteran need to consent to copays still? and/or provide income info for SC meds??
  - Yes, but don’t need to do the financial disclosure piece.

> Need financial info to determine how far they want to carry their benefits

> Lots of question on how it impact other insurance and if there are additional cost. Does this affect my medicare?

**Ideal State Notes**

- Ideal state for SC - from disability rating / awards letter - link to accept copay and agreements

> Just ask if they wish to enroll (for service connected group). If they say no, ask if they want an appointment for screening. Then ask what type of appointment they want.
>  let them know, legally, if you registrated you only receive care for your service-connected claims. If you enroll, you get full health services.

> Want a Yes/No and disclosure about copays.(for under 40%)

> Did you serve more than 24 months” ; biggest hindrance for them is that the information is not in the system. DOD did not update, VBA did not update.

### Mental Health

**Finding #1 - Unaware of care available and VA definitions throw Veterans off**

- Have to meet basic eligibility criteria to register. Can be seen on humanitarian basis if not, will be given resources for community
- 
  
> They have to ask. Can call in and they will ask if they want to register or enroll

**Finding #2 - Going through Primary Care can be a pain point**

- Pain point: Have to go through primary care for everything, can't always just get seen for mental health care. Takes a long time

> Yes; can be referred directly to mental health care but still need to see a case manager (PCP)


**Finding #3 - Communication and information surfaced. Strategic marketing is important**

- Community news, social media, TV news, billboards, radio...we have to put our information out there
- More consistent communication - not just in big events like PACT Act

> Quote

**Current pain points**
- Making sure they have all materials with them; makes 30-45 minutes to complete over the phone

**Ideal State Notes**

> Listing of the provider with their specialty, provider, and even with rating. Having that knowledge of who is available and who isn’t
> Stagetic marketing; they’ll get their information from friends, family, and neighbor. If we put reading material out there, they can come in with accurate information instead of hearsay.
