    * **Patrick** - Is there a process for Veterans to direct them here (to register)?
* **Meena** - Concerned because VES has already done the work (in SQA)
* **Patrick** - Provided example of Veteran registering at time of scheduling appointment
    * Having Reg endpoint is great, but we dont think we have a product built around it
    * Putting a form on it does not seem like the right thing to do
* **Shawn** - Need to have the business involved

* NoK/EC
    * Ready and in SQA smoke testing this week! 
        * Once done, will be ready for consuming and testing
    * VA Profile using this, which would call this new service
    * Also update will be pushed to VA Profile
    * Whatever JF says to do, that is what our team can do
    * In the past, for this kind of Associated Person info has gone thru VA Profile, reading off VES and updating via VA Profile
- [ ] **Action Item**: Confirm with Josh F: Do we call VES? Or do we call VA Profile that updates VES?
