## Outcome Summary
* Allow Veterans to provide and update the answers to their Toxic Exposure Risk Assessment (TERA) on the online 10-10EZR. This will make it so that Veterans can answer questions about whether they were exposed to toxic materials and situations while in the service. It will allow Veterans who were not previously eligible for healthcare to re-submit for (and in many cases receive) care, and will give others a higher Priority Group (from PG 7 and 8 to PG 6) and receive additional care.  

## Problem
* Veterans who applied for healthcare before PACT Act 103 (March 5, 2024) do not currently have a place online to provide information relating to their toxic exposure while serving.
* Veterans who have already submitted their TERA information do not have a place online to update their answers 

## Desired User Outcomes
- Unqualified Veterans may now qualify for VA health care by providing this information
- Veterans whose disability rating and priority group is reduced due to improved health may still qualify for at least Priority Group 6 due to Toxic Exposure
