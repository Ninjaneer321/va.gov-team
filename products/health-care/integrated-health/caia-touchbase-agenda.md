# Agenda for Bi-weekly CAIA touchbases
The purpose of these meetings are to determine timelines for content work and discuss open items/ blocker related to content of the IVC forms.

## December 12, 2024
- CHAMPVA claims staging review date
- CHAMPVA multiple claims flow

  
 ### Notes
- FMP Claims:

    - No date yet
    - Are we allowing Kaiser Permanente insurance? Jamie to check that notes and follow up with CHAMPVA claim partners
    - Multiple Claims will be post MVP
    - Check on what the max amount of claims we can upload in List & Loop. Check with engineers.
    - Aliyah will clarify what is a claim (date of service), possibly on intro screen 
    - Will remove the submit "one claim at a time" from intro page of list and loop, maybe think about moving to the upload page
- CHAMPVA OHI: 
  - Will be the next one to go to staging review 
  - CAIA can do another pass at content review
- CHAMPVA App
  - Check on processing time for the form, heard from CHAMPVA that it may need to change to 6 months. CAIA will confirm
  - May have some more work coming to CAIA soon due to some post-launch data
  - Double check on release on CHAMPVA. Alyiah saw that it's open to everyone rather than 50%
