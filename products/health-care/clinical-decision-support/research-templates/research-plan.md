### Location
Currently, all clinical research for CDSC takes place remotely over MS Teams. We do not have processes in place to conduct in-person research with clinicians and VA staff. We will update this guide as things change.

- [x] **Remote**


## Research materials üìî

> [!NOTE]
> **Have your research plan reviewed by the OCTO VA HCD Lead or a CDS HCD Peer review before beginning recruitment. This doesn't mean the research plan has to be 100% finalized, but reviewed to ensure we are clear on our target participants**

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment üéØ	
*Recruitment for CDSC research is done by the researcher. Account for recruitment in your planning and preparation time. Ideally outreach begins 2-4 weeks ahead of targeted testing dates*


### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. clinicians, VHA administrative staff, coordinators, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 

`Audience:` [enter user group here]

**`1.`CDSC Research Participant Database:** The CDSC research participant database is available to CDSC HCD Practictioners. If you are not part of this group, ask the OCTO CDSC VA Lead to assist with recruitment. 

**`2.`SSS Clinician Office Hours:** SSS hosts a weekly office hours for clinicians and other VHA staff. If you have an upcoming study, consider attending office hours to share about your study and see if any folks are interested or could connect you with someone.

**`3.`Application Support and Feedback:** SSS manages initial platform and app team support for CDS. Review support and feedback queries that come in and see who submitted the feedback and if they might match your study criteria. For example, a physician who requested a new calculator or had trouble with autopopulation may be interested in reviewing new designs.

**`4.`Snowball:** Ask your prior participants if they can share your name and email or the sign-up form with their colleauges to find new participants.

**`5.`Product SME:** Ask your product SME if they have other contacts you can engage with. 

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. This is helpful if getting recruitment assistance from CDSC peers.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question. 
  Example: Have you used CDS Medical Calcualtors in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider what criteria MUST be met, versus what is nice to have.

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (clinicians, VHA administrative staff, coordinators, etc.) of participants for this study:
> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **2x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 6 ideal completed sessions, plan to email at least 12 participants)*

- `Clinicians - CPRS:` **[n]**
- `Clinicians - Oracle:` **[n]**
- `VHA admin staff:` **[n]**
- `Total:` **[n]**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **[n]**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study. For example, is it important to capture both inpatient and outpatient care settings? Or are you looking for a certain specialty or role such as a nurse practitionaer or physician?* 

- `[Place primary criteria here between hash marks when in edit mode]`
- `primary criteria`
- `primary criteria`
- **`Add more criteria as needed`**

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
*What criteria would strengthen your results? For example, getting a variety of FTE percentage (patient facing time) or providers who work float schedules. Secondary criteria could also be role types, specialty, etc depending on the priority for a given study *

## Timeline üóìÔ∏è
Consider recruitment lead time is often 2-4 weeks. 

### Outreach Email Templates
**General template, adjustments made for individual emails based on context or prior connection with participant. The outreach email must contain the line about voluntary participation and anonymity**

Hello (Name),

My name is (researcher/designer name), and we previously connected via your support request to (enter request or issue). 

I am reaching out now to see if you would be interested in participating in a design feedback session. We are currently evaluating some new designs for the (product name). I‚Äôd love to get your perspective and feedback on these new concepts. It would involve participating in a 60-minute remote session on MS Teams. The session would include a general introduction and current experience with (product name), then I would share a design prototype with you along with a few probes to get your reactions, followed by closing questions. 

**Your choice to participate is completely voluntary. We will share our learnings within the CDS Collaborative in the form of aggregated information or anonymized quotes. Your responses will remain confidential, and your anonymity protected.**

If you are interested in participating, the following days and times are available. Please respond to this email with a few 60-minute options that work for you, and I will send an invitation. If you are interested in participating, but not available for this session, please keep an eye out for future opportunities. 

All times are in **Eastern** time:

Week of September 15:

- Friday, September 19: 9:30 ‚Äì 11am
  
Week of September 22

## Team Roles  üïµÔ∏èüë©‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüî¨

> [!NOTE]
> **Please do not include email addresses in this section.** We previously required email addresses. VA's GitHub policy ([see announcement](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/discussions/13)) has changed. VA.gov email addresses cannot be in public repositories.
>
> **Please list the names of people in each role.** In the Slack study channel, send an email and primary phone number for the moderator. Also send emails for the notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker.

- `Moderator:` **[Enter full name]**	
- `Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):` **[Enter full name]**		
- `Participant recruiting & screening:`	**[Enter full name]**	
- `Project point of contact:` **[Enter full name]**

- **[Enter full name]**
- **[Enter full name]**
- **[Enter full name]**

### Notetaker and Silent Obeserver Guide
- Be a silent observer. If you have a question for the participant, ask the facilitator via a Slack DM and they'll accommodate it if appropriate.
- If you can notetake, please do! It helps researchers a lot to see what you captured. There‚Äôs a note taking template in this Mural with screenshots. If you find it easier to write your notes or use a word doc, that's fine too! If you take running notes, please be sure to make a clear reference to the screen in question or the scenario being mentioned.
- Write what you hear and see as much as possible. For some it can be easier to write in first person, as it is said, so that you don't need to paraphrase anything. Try to capture what they said without adding your own interpretation of what they meant. E.g. "I'm not sure about this checkbox" does not equal "Doesn't understand checkbox."
- Share your notes back with the facilitator via Slack if taken outside of the mural. Do not include ANY PII in this chat.
- For design testing, try to write down things that aren't said‚Äîfor instance, when someone misunderstood some copy or clicked the wrong element. It helps us figure out what needs to be revisited.
- Share a few raw impressions with the facilitator via Slack or in the notetaking document after the interview is done, if possible. It helps with synthesis!

**Protecting PII**
- It's important to protect the privacy of our VHA staff participants AND any Veterans. 
- Do not include the participants name or other identifiers -- such as a very specific title that can be easy to identify them with in your notes. Instead, use a general role description, such as "primary care provider" and "also works in informatics"
- In the event a participant needs to share their screen or a tool with an actual patient (since test patients don't always work to show how the tool functions), stop the recording before they share. DO NOT RECORD THE PARTICIPANT'S SCREEN IF THEY ARE SHOWING A REAL PATIENT.
