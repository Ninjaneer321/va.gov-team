### [OCTO-DSD Priorities](insert link here) 

<details><summary>Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed. </summary>


`Objective 1:  VA‚Äôs digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.`  

> - **Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences by 50%, towards a goal of less than 4 seconds per transaction.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of transactions received via our digital experiences are either processed correctly or we have notified the user of an error.

`Objective 2: OCTO‚Äôs platforms are the fastest, most efficient, and most secure way to deliver products at VA.`

> - **Key Result 1:** 100% of authentications to our systems and tools (both Veteran-facing and internal) occur using a secure credential.
> - **Key Result 2:** We have reduced the total error rates in our platforms by 50% compared to Q4 2024, towards a goal less than 1% per endpoint.
> - **Key Result 3:** 100% of VA employees have access to a valuable Generative AI tool to help with their work.
> - **Key Result 4:** Each of our platforms* and tools increase the number of non-OCTO built capabilities or non-OCTO users by 50%. (*excluding mobile)

`Objective 3: OCTO teammates are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact.`

> - **Key Result 1:** Team members reporting more than a reasonable amount of stress is 5 points lower for each quarter in 2025 than it was in the corresponding quarter in 2024.
> - **Key Result 2:** Every OCTO Portfolio identifies 2 or more strategic decisions per quarter that would benefit the larger OCTO team, and documents them publicly in a shared location.
> - **Key Result 3:** 75% or more team members are confident they have the knowledge needed to make effective decisions.

`Objective 4: OCTO positively influences VA's ability to deliver software products and services faster, safer, and with higher quality.`

> - **Key Result 1:** OCTO has delivered at least 10 impactful artifacts or learning activities (e.g., trainings, guides, COP meetings) focused on improving delivery practices that achieve an NPS score of 30 or higher from the target OIT delivery staff.
> - **Key Result 2:** OCTO has helped resolve/support at least 10 significant engineering issues or products outside our portfolio.
> - **Key Result 3:** Five or more non-OCTO teams have used SPRUCE to deliver high quality software.

## Recruitment üéØ	
*Recruitment for CDSC research is done by the researcher. Account for recruitment in your planning and preparation time. Ideally outreach begins 2-4 weeks ahead of targeted testing dates*


### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. clinicians, VHA administrative staff, coordinators, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 

`Audience:` [enter user group here]

**`1.`CDSC Research Participant Database:** The CDSC research participant database is available to CDSC HCD Practictioners. If you are not part of this group, ask the OCTO CDSC VA Lead to assist with recruitment. 

**`2.`SSS Clinician Office Hours:** SSS hosts a weekly office hours for clinicians and other VHA staff. If you have an upcoming study, consider attending office hours to share about your study and see if any folks are interested or could connect you with someone.

**`3.`Application Support and Feedback:** SSS manages initial platform and app team support for CDS. Review support and feedback queries that come in and see who submitted the feedback and if they might match your study criteria. For example, a physician who requested a new calculator or had trouble with autopopulation may be interested in reviewing new designs.

**`4.`Snowball:** Ask your prior participants if they can share your name and email or the sign-up form with their colleauges to find new participants.

**`5.`Product SME:** Ask your product SME if they have other contacts you can engage with. 

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. This is helpful if getting recruitment assistance from CDSC peers.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question. 
  Example: Have you used CDS Medical Calcualtors in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider what criteria MuST be met, versus what is nice to have.

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (clinicians, VHA administrative staff, coordinators, etc.) of participants for this study:
> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **2x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 6 ideal completed sessions, plan to email at least 12 participants)*

- `Clinicians - CPRS:` **[n]**
- `Clinicians - Oracle:` **[n]**
- `VHA admin staff:` **[n]**
- `Total:` **[n]**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **[n]**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study. For example, is it important to capture both inpatient and outpatient care settings? Or are you looking for a certain specialty or role such as a nurse practitionaer or physician?* 

- `[Place primary criteria here between hash marks when in edit mode]`
- `primary criteria`
- `primary criteria`
- **`Add more criteria as needed`**

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
*What criteria would strengthen your results? For example, getting a variety of FTE percentage (patient facing time) or providers who work float schedules. Secondary criteria could also be role types, specialty, etc depending on the priority for a given study *

## Timeline üóìÔ∏è
Consider recruitment lead time is often 2-4 weeks. 


### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been shared via Slack in #cds-hcd-cop or DS Office Hours for feedback. 

**A pilot session is required. Find a partipant in the HDC CoP slack channel or your product team** 

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[Enter time length]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[Enter buffer time]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[Enter NUM per day]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> Since clinicians work across the country, consider how you might accomodate early and later schedules. If you need to widen your hours or get support from another HCD peer to broaden the availability, consider this in your planning. A lot of ET clinicians are available early, 8am ET as they prepare for their day or during lunch hours. Early afternoon often catches PT participants who are at their lunch break too.
