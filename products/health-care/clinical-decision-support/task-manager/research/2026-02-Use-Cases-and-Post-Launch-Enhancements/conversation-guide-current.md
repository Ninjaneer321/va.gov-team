# Intro (5 min)

Hello. My name is **[Moderator]**. And these are my colleagues [**Notetaker/Observer**]. As you may be aware, we’re team members working on the Task Manager Application, as a part of the Clinical Decision Support Collaborative.

The discussion will primarily be between you and me, however occasionally I’ll have my colleagues jump in to gather input.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

### Expectation setting

- This entire session should take about an hour. We’ll be discussing how tasks generally fit into your role, then gather more specific feedback about how task manager creates, displays and updates tasks, before wrapping up with a few final questions. 
- The purpose of this conversation is to better understand what you're looking to accomplish needs as a user. Anything you share with us helps us understand ways to improve task manager to ensure it meets your needs.
- Do you have any questions for me, at this point?

### Consent to Record

- One more thing. Would you be comfortable if we record this session? We use recordings for note taking purposes to ensure we’ve captured your input accurately. If we need to, we can pause the recording at any time, or switch the recording to audio only if you need to to show me something that has patient info on it.
- **_If yes:_** Great. I’ll get the recording started. And once it’s going, I’ll have you confirm again just for the recording. <mark>**Start recording**</mark>
- **_Once recording starts:_** Can you confirm for me that you’re comfortable for us to record this session?



# General Discussion

### Department and Role (5 min)

### Role

Great. To begin with. I’d like to learn a little bit about what you do within VA health systems. Can you share a little bit about your department and the role you play in it?

> [!TIP]
> Listen for: **Treatment environment**
>
> - **Modality** (Telehealth, On-site, In Home)
> - **Setting** (Inpatient, Outpatient, ED)
> - **Treatment goal** (Preventative, Ambulatory, Acute, Sub-Acute, Palliative / Long term)
> - **Delivery Mechanism** (Site, Care Team, Float Pool)
>
> **Role emphasis**
>
> - **Patient care focus** (Direct care vs Operational Support)
> - **Treatment process** (diagnosis vs treatment implementation)

  

### High Level Use Cases (6 mins)

As I understand it, you’re currently using task manager to facilitate task tracking and coordination. 
What type of tasks are you managing?

> [!TIP]
> Probe:
> **Individual vs Team Use**
>
> - Are you mostly using it to manage your own tasks? Or are you using it to coordinate with other team members?
>
> **Tool Use**
>
> - Anything you’re not using task manager for task coordination? Why?
>
> **Bright spots and Gaps**
>
> - What’s working well?
> - What’s needs improvement?
> - Any things you wish you were able to do, but can’t? What are they? Why is that important?

# Task Manager Feedback

Switching gears, I wanted to discuss your experiences using task manager. If it helps, we can also have you share your screen and turn off screen recording for this portion of the session.

### Use Case Workflows - Task List (10 mins)

Let’s take a look at the task list together.
You shared a little bit about the tasks you manage. At a high level, walk me through the lifecycle of a task from creation to assignment to task completion.

> [!TIP]
> Listen for: **Task management responsibilities**
>
> - Task collaboration
> - Task oversight
> - Task transfer / handoff
>
> **Organizing Model** 
>
> - Task relationship with patients (1:1 vs 1 to many)
> - Task relationship with team member roles / workflow

<mark>[ Prompt about task lifecycle for each additional use case]</mark>

### Task creation – Task Detail (5 mins)

Thanks for that. Let’s take a closer look at creating tasks together.
Go ahead and click “add a task”.

#### Workflow

- Can you share a little bit about your overall experience with creating tasks?
- What’s working? What can be improved?

> [!TIP]
> Listen for: **Efficiency concerns / workflow preferences**

#### Task detail attributes

What about the details in this view?

- What here is useful and relevant? 
- Any fields here that you don’t need?
- Any fields that are missing?
- What patient details would you hope to see when creating tasks?

### Tracking / Monitoring Tasks – Task Grid / Task Detail (8 mins)

Ok. That’s helpful. Let’s take a closer look at tracking and monitoring tasks. Go ahead and return to the task list.

- Can you share a little bit about your overall experience with tracking and monitoring tasks?
- What are you typically tracking?
- What’s working? What can be improved?
- Are there any different ways you wish you were able to sort, filter or organize these tasks that you’re not currently able to? What would be useful?
- Any features relating to tracking / monitoring tasks that might be useful for you?

### Updates and Follow Through – Task Grid / Task Detail (5 mins)

Finally, I wanted to get a sense of what your experience is with following up on tasks.
What’s working? What can be improved?

#### Task detail attributes

What about the details in this view?

- What here is useful and relevant? 
- Any fields here that you don’t need?
- Any fields that are missing?
- What patient details would you hope to see when updating tasks?

## Use Context Validation (Optional - 5 mins)

### Tasks

Ok. Great. Before we close, I wanted to quickly recap what we’d discussed today.
What you’re looking at is an outline of where task tracking and coordination may appear in different working contexts.

It sounds like…
<mark>[ Validate task tracking use cases across working contexts and team members involved ]</mark>

- Are there any working contexts that I don’t have represented here?
- Are there any additional tasks or activities worth calling out?

> [!TIP]
> Probe:
>
> - Start of shift
> - Pre-Visit
> - During-Visit
> - Post-visit
> - Team Huddles
> - Shift-End Actions
> - Ongoing Review

### Task Involvement

Who tends to be involved in those tasks? How do they tend to participate?

> [!TIP]
> Probe:
>
> - Collaboration
> - Oversight
> - Transfer / handoff

# Wrap Up (5 mins)

- Is there anything else you’d like to share about task management or task manager today? 
- Reflecting on all that we discussed today, what feature or improvement stands to have the greatest impact to improve your workflow tracking and managing tasks?
- Before we close do you have any questions for us?
- Great! Thank you so much for all that you’ve shared with us! Direct input from team members like you helps us understand the work you’re looking to accomplish and lets us identify ways to better meet your needs. If there’s anyone you think we’d benefit from connecting with, we’d appreciate you sending them our way.
- I can follow up to provide something you can pass along to them to facilitate the introduction.

Thanks again and enjoy the rest of your day!
