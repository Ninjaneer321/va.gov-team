## Intro (5 mins)

Hello. My name is **[Moderator]**. And these are my colleagues [**Notetaker/Observer**]. As you may be aware, we’re team members working on the Task Manager Application, as a part of the Clinical Decision Support Collaborative.

The discussion will primarily be between you and me, however occasionally I’ll have my colleagues jump in to gather input.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

### Research Intent

- The purpose of the conversation is to better understand how **task management and task coordination** applies to your role within VA health systems.
- We want to hear your honest opinions. Anything you share with us will remain confidential. Insights you share helps us **improve task manager to ensure it meets your needs**.

### Expectation setting

- This entire session should take about 50 minutes. To keep us on track I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- Over the course of the hour, we’ll cover, a general discussion of how tasks fit into your role, then we’ll take a look at task manager together to gather feedback about creating and revising tasks, and monitoring tasks, before we wrap-up with a few final questions.
- Do you have any questions for me, at this point?

### Consent to Record

- One more thing. Would you be comfortable if we record this session? We use recordings for note taking purposes to ensure we’ve captured your input accurately. If we need to, we can pause the recording at any time, or switch the recording to audio only if you need to to show me something that has patient info on it.
- If yes: Great. I’ll get the recording started. And once it’s going, I’ll have you confirm again just for the recording.

- Can you confirm for me that you’re comfortable for us to record this session?
- **Start recording >>** *[Only record transcript for Section 1]*



## Department and Role (10 mins)

Great. To begin with. I’d like to learn a little bit about what you do within VA health systems. Can you share a little bit about your department and the role you play in it?

> [!TIP]
>
> Listen for: **Treatment environment**
>
> - **Modality** (Telehealth, On-site, In Home)
> - **Setting** (Inpatient, Outpatient, ED)
> - *Treatment goal** (Preventative, Ambulatory, Acute, Sub-Acute, Palliative / Long term)
> - **Delivery Mechanism** (Site, Care Team, Float Pool)
>
> **Role emphasis**
>
> - **Patient care focus** (Direct care vs Operational Support) 
> - **Treatment process** (diagnosis vs treatment implementation)



## High Level Use Cases (10 mins)

The purpose of task manager is to help team members facilitate task tracking and coordination to ensure completion and follow-through. 

- When it comes to your work, what type of tasks are you managing? 

> [!TIP]
>
> Probe: **Individual vs Team Use****
>
> - Are you mostly using it to manage your own tasks?
> - Or, are you using it to coordinate with other team members? Who typically is involved?
>
> **Tool Use**
>
> - How are you currently tracking and coordinating your tasks?
>
> **Bright spots and Gaps**
>
> - What’s working well?
> - What’s needs improvement?
> - Any things you wish you were able to do, but can’t?
>   What are they? Why is that important?



## Workflow Details (20 mins)

Great. I’d love to dig a little deeper into these workflows and talk through the lifecycle of each of these task types from creation to assignment to task completion.

### Validate Task Types

It sounds like these are the type of tasks you’re tracking…

- <mark>**[Validate any tasks mentioned previously]**</mark>
- Are there any additional tasks or activities worth calling out?

### Task Life Cycle (for each task type)

Help me understand at a high level, the lifecycle of this particular set of tasks.

- What are the steps that you’re tracking for this particular set of tasks?

> [!TIP]
>
> Probe: **Workflow**
>
> - Who typically is involved? How do they tend to participate?
> - What happens when this work is completed?
>
> **Task Monitoring and Updates**
>
> - How frequently are you tracking this item? What are you looking out for?
> - What kinds of updates are you capturing for each set of tasks?
>
> **Organizing Model**
>
> - Do you have one task representing each patient? Or multiple tasks tagged to each patient?



## Use Context Validation (Optional - 5 mins)

Ok. Great. Before we close, I wanted to quickly recap what we’d discussed today.
What you’re looking at is an outline of where task tracking and coordination workflows tend to occur for VA healthcare team members.

<mark> **[ Recap task types - map them loosely to relevant work contexts ]** </mark>

- Are there any working contexts that I don’t have represented here?
- Are there any additional tasks or activities worth calling out?
- What are you typically tracking for these tasks? Who typically is invovled?

> [!TIP]
>
> Refer to use context diagram.

> - Start / End of Shift
> - Pre / During / Post-Encounter
> - Team Huddles
> - Daily / Weekly / Monthly / Quarterly / Yearly Review



## Wrap Up (5 mins)

- Is there anything else you’d like to share about task management or task manager today? 
- Reflecting on all that we discussed today, what feature or improvement stands to have the greatest impact to improve your workflow tracking and managing tasks?
- Before we close do you have any questions for us?
- Great! Thank you so much for all that you’ve shared with us! Direct input from team members like you helps us understand the work you’re looking to accomplish and lets us identify ways to better meet your needs. If there’s anyone you think we’d benefit from connecting with, we’d appreciate you sending them our way.
- I can follow up to provide something you can pass along to them to facilitate the introduction.

Thanks again and enjoy the rest of your day!
