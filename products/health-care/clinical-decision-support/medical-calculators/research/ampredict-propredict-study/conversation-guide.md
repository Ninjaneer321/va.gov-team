# Conversation Guide for Testing Time to Complete Calculation in AMPREDICT and PROPREDICT

## Moderator logistics 📋✅
### 2-3 days before the session

`List and complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study below:`

- [ ] Email with instructions to access CDS tools has been sent along with a link to the pre-task survey
- [ ] Confirm CPRS is working
- [ ] Share session schedule for notetaker/observers


### Day of the session

> [!TIP]
> - Create a DM group in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
> - Mute your Slack notifications.
> - Send out the Notetaker and Observer Guide

### Notetaker and Silent Obeserver Guide
- Be a silent observer. If you have a question for the participant, ask the facilitator via a Slack DM and they'll accommodate it if appropriate.
- If you can notetake, please do! It helps researchers a lot to see what you captured. There’s a note taking template in this Mural with screenshots. If you find it easier to write your notes or use a word doc, that's fine too! If you take running notes, please be sure to make a clear reference to the screen in question or the scenario being mentioned.
- Write what you hear and see as much as possible. For some it can be easier to write in first person, as it is said, so that you don't need to paraphrase anything. Try to capture what they said without adding your own interpretation of what they meant. E.g. "I'm not sure about this checkbox" does not equal "Doesn't understand checkbox."
- Share your notes back with the facilitator via Slack if taken outside of the mural. Do not include ANY PII in this chat.
- For design testing, try to write down things that aren't said—for instance, when someone misunderstood some copy or clicked the wrong element. It helps us figure out what needs to be revisited.
- Share a few raw impressions with the facilitator via Slack or in the notetaking document after the interview is done, if possible. It helps with synthesis!

**Protecting PII**
- It's important to protect the privacy of our VHA staff participants AND any Veterans. 
- Do not include the participants name or other identifiers -- such as a very specific title that can be easy to identify them with in your notes. Instead, use a general role description, such as "primary care provider" and "also works in informatics"
- In the event a participant needs to share their screen or a tool with an actual patient (since test patients don't always work to show how the tool functions), stop the recording before they share. DO NOT RECORD THE PARTICIPANT'S SCREEN IF THEY ARE SHOWING A REAL PATIENT.


### Starting the session

> [!TIP]
> - In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
> - In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
> - Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
> - When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Natalie and I'm a Senior Product Designer for the CDS Medical Calculators team. Rosemary, our Principal Researcher, is here to help with note taking and observing the session. Is that OK?
> [!TIP]
> - Ask the notetaker to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

Today we're going to talk about AMPREDICT/PROPREDICT -- both the online tool and the new CDS calculator. Were you able to complete the pre-task questionnaire we sent via email recently?

[If the survey hasn't been completed, share a link in the chat and ask participant to complete before test begins.]

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 20 minutes.** I want to make sure I leave some space for your questions too, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
- **Your participation in this session is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Your responses will remain confidential and your anonymity protected. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

Before we look at the calculator, I'd like to learn a little bit about you. 

> [!TIP]
> - These are placeholder questions, but work well across a lot of situations. Adjust as you need for your study.
> - If it's a prior participant, consider skipping or modifying the intro questions or following up on something you previously learned from them.

1. Can you tell me about your current role at the VA and how long have you been at the VA?

## Timed Task 1 - 5-7 minutes

Next we’re going to look at the online AMPREDICT/PROPREDICT calculator.  

- Please navigate to: https://www.ampdecide.org/ampredict/risk-calculator OR https://prodecide.org/risk-calculator (share link in chat)
- For the session today, we want to capture the time it takes to complete a few tasks. I'll ask you to do something and then I'll want you to complete it as you normally would.
- Now, please open a patient in CPRS so you can input their data into the calculator.
- When you are ready please begin sharing your screen so the online calculator is visible.

[Screen sharing begins.]

- Next I will be timing how long it takes to complete a calculation.
- Please don't feel rushed to complete the task, just move through the workflow as you normally would. This is not a race, it's a way for us to gather benchmarking data on how long it realistically takes to complete a calculation.
- Before you start entering data, please let me know so I can start the timer.
- And please let me know when you have completed a calculation so I can stop the timer.
- Are you ready to begin? 

[Start timer upon verbal confirmation.]

[Participant moves through task flow.]

[Stop timer upon verbal confirmation.]

## Task 1 Debrief - 1 minute

Great, thank you for completing that calculation. Do you have any questions or comments before we move on to the next task?

## Timed Task 2 - 5-7 minutes

Next, we'll move on to the CDS Medical Calculators tool and perform the same calculation using a different patient in CPRS.

- Please open a new patient in CPRS.
- Next, please navigate to CDS Tools > CDS Console and click on the Medical Calculators tile on the console landing page.
- Now, navigate to AMPREDICT/PROPREDICT in the calculators list, but don't click on it just yet.
- When you are ready to begin, please let me know and I'll start the timer. Again, just move through the workflow as you normally would.
- And please let me know when you have completed a calculation so I can stop the timer.  

[Start timer upon verbal confirmation.]

[Participant moves through task flow.]

[Stop timer upon verbal confirmation.]

## Task 2 debrief - 1 minute

Great, thank you for completing that task. You can stop screen sharing now.

[Screen sharing stops.]

# Post-Task Questionnaire - 3 minutes

Next, I'll share a link in the chat to a brief post-task questionnaire. Since the tasks are fresh in your mind, do you mind completing the questionnaire while I hang on the meeting?

[Share post-task survey link in chat.]

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on these tools to better meet clinician needs.

Thanks! Lastly, would you be interested in participating in another study like this for [this product] or [another product on the CDS console]? And do you have other colleagues who you think might be interested in participating in sessions like this? Would you be willing to share a link for them to sign-up?

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
