# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Natalie and I'm a Senior Product Designer for the CDS Medical Calculators team. Rosemary, our Principal Researcher, is here to help with note taking and observing the session. Is that OK? 

Today we're going to talk about AMPREDICT/PROPREDICT -- both the online tool and the new CDS calculator. Were you able to complete the pre-task questionnaire we sent via email recently?

[If the survey hasn't been completed, share a link in the chat and ask participant to complete before test begins.]

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 20 minutes.** For the session today, we want to capture the time it takes to complete a few tasks. I'll ask you to do something and then I'll want you to complete it as you normally would. Please don't feel rushed to complete the task. This is not a race, it's a way for us to gather benchmarking data on how long it realistically takes to complete a calculation.
    
- **Your participation in this session is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Your responses will remain confidential and your anonymity will be protected. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

Before we look at the calculator, I'd like to learn a little bit about you. Can you tell me about your current role at the VA and how long have you been at the VA?

## Timed Task 1 - 5-7 minutes

This first task will involve the online AMPREDICT/PROPREDICT calculator.  

- Please open a patient in CPRS.
- Please navigate to: https://www.ampdecide.org/ampredict/risk-calculator OR https://prodecide.org/risk-calculator (share link in chat). Please don't enter any data yet.
- When you are ready, please begin sharing your screen so the online calculator is visible.

[Screen sharing begins.]

- Before you begin entering data, please let me know so I can start the timer.
- And, please let me know when you have completed a calculation so I can stop the timer.
- Are you ready to begin? If so, I'll start the timer now.

[Start timer upon verbal confirmation.]

[Participant moves through task flow.]

[Stop timer upon verbal confirmation.]

## Task 1 Debrief - 1 minute

Great, thank you for completing that calculation. Do you have any questions or comments before we move on to the next task?

## Timed Task 2 - 5-7 minutes

Next, we'll move on to the CDS Medical Calculators tool and perform the same calculation using a different patient in CPRS.

- Please open a new patient in CPRS.
- Next, please navigate to CDS Tools > CDS Console and click on the Medical Calculators tile on the console landing page.
- Now, navigate to AMPREDICT/PROPREDICT in the calculators list, but don't click on it just yet.
- When you are ready to begin, please let me know and I'll start the timer. Again, just move through the workflow as you normally would.
- And please let me know when you have completed a calculation so I can stop the timer.  

[Start timer upon verbal confirmation.]

[Participant moves through task flow.]

[Stop timer upon verbal confirmation.]

## Task 2 debrief - 1 minute

Great, thank you for completing that task. You can stop screen sharing now. Do you have any questions or comments?

[Screen sharing stops.]

# Post-Task Questionnaire - 3 minutes

Next, I'll share a link in the chat to a brief post-task questionnaire. Please complete that as the final task before we close out the meeting and let me know when you're finished.

[Share post-task survey link in chat.]

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on these tools to better meet clinician needs.

Thanks! Lastly, would you be interested in participating in another study like this for [this product] or [another product on the CDS console]? And do you have other colleagues who you think might be interested in participating in sessions like this? Would you be willing to share a link for them to sign-up?

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so it's easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
