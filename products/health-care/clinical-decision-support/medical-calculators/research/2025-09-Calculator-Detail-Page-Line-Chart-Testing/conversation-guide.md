# Conversation Guide for [initiative]

## Moderator logistics 📋✅
### 2-3 days before the session

> [!NOTE]
> Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist).

`List and complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study below:`

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
- [ ] Step 3

### Day of the session

> [!TIP]
> - Create a DM group in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
> - Mute your Slack notifications.
> - Send out the Notetaker and Observer Guide

### Notetaker and Silent Obeserver Guide
- Be a silent observer. If you have a question for the participant, ask the facilitator via a Slack DM and they'll accommodate it if appropriate.
- If you can notetake, please do! It helps researchers a lot to see what you captured. There’s a note taking template in this Mural with screenshots. If you find it easier to write your notes or use a word doc, that's fine too! If you take running notes, please be sure to make a clear reference to the screen in question or the scenario being mentioned.
- Write what you hear and see as much as possible. For some it can be easier to write in first person, as it is said, so that you don't need to paraphrase anything. Try to capture what they said without adding your own interpretation of what they meant. E.g. "I'm not sure about this checkbox" does not equal "Doesn't understand checkbox."
- Share your notes back with the facilitator via Slack if taken outside of the mural. Do not include ANY PII in this chat.
- For design testing, try to write down things that aren't said—for instance, when someone misunderstood some copy or clicked the wrong element. It helps us figure out what needs to be revisited.
- Share a few raw impressions with the facilitator via Slack or in the notetaking document after the interview is done, if possible. It helps with synthesis!

**Protecting PII**
- It's important to protect the privacy of our VHA staff participants AND any Veterans. 
- Do not include the participants name or other identifiers -- such as a very specific title that can be easy to identify them with in your notes. Instead, use a general role description, such as "primary care provider" and "also works in informatics"
- In the event a participant needs to share their screen or a tool with an actual patient (since test patients don't always work to show how the tool functions), stop the recording before they share. DO NOT RECORD THE PARTICIPANT'S SCREEN IF THEY ARE SHOWING A REAL PATIENT.


### Starting the session

> [!TIP]
> - In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
> - In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
> - Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
> - When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** & **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is/are here to help with note taking and observing the session. Is that OK?
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

Today we're going to talk about [insert topic]

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to make sure I leave some space for your questions too, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this session is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Your responses will remain confidential and your anonymity protected. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
       
- *(If applicable)* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. <mark>**Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.**</mark>
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we use a general role, like primary care physiciant or give you a participant ID, like P7. A general role or care setting helps provide a lens for the quote.
  
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand clinicians’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with clinicians. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - **Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
 
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

 <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
