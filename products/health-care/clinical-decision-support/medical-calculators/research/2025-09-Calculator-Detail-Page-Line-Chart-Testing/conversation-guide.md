# Conversation Guide for [initiative]

## Moderator logistics 📋✅
### 2-3 days before the session

`List and complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study below:`

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
- [ ] Step 3

### Day of the session

> [!TIP]
> - Create a DM group in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
> - Mute your Slack notifications.
> - Send out the Notetaker and Observer Guide

### Notetaker and Silent Obeserver Guide
- Be a silent observer. If you have a question for the participant, ask the facilitator via a Slack DM and they'll accommodate it if appropriate.
- If you can notetake, please do! It helps researchers a lot to see what you captured. There’s a note taking template in this Mural with screenshots. If you find it easier to write your notes or use a word doc, that's fine too! If you take running notes, please be sure to make a clear reference to the screen in question or the scenario being mentioned.
- Write what you hear and see as much as possible. For some it can be easier to write in first person, as it is said, so that you don't need to paraphrase anything. Try to capture what they said without adding your own interpretation of what they meant. E.g. "I'm not sure about this checkbox" does not equal "Doesn't understand checkbox."
- Share your notes back with the facilitator via Slack if taken outside of the mural. Do not include ANY PII in this chat.
- For design testing, try to write down things that aren't said—for instance, when someone misunderstood some copy or clicked the wrong element. It helps us figure out what needs to be revisited.
- Share a few raw impressions with the facilitator via Slack or in the notetaking document after the interview is done, if possible. It helps with synthesis!

**Protecting PII**
- It's important to protect the privacy of our VHA staff participants AND any Veterans. 
- Do not include the participants name or other identifiers -- such as a very specific title that can be easy to identify them with in your notes. Instead, use a general role description, such as "primary care provider" and "also works in informatics"
- In the event a participant needs to share their screen or a tool with an actual patient (since test patients don't always work to show how the tool functions), stop the recording before they share. DO NOT RECORD THE PARTICIPANT'S SCREEN IF THEY ARE SHOWING A REAL PATIENT.


### Starting the session

> [!TIP]
> - In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
> - In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
> - Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
> - When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

# Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is **[NAME]** and **[NOTETAKER NAME]** & **[NOTETAKER NAME]** is/are here to help with note taking and observing the session. Is that OK?
> [!TIP]
> - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to **give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov.** (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
> - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

Today we're going to talk about [insert topic]

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to make sure I leave some space for your questions too, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
  
- **Your participation in this session is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Your responses will remain confidential and your anonymity protected. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
       
- *(If applicable)* **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. 
  
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we use a general role, like primary care physiciant or give you a participant ID, like P7. A general role or care setting helps provide a lens for the quote.
  
   - **Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>
     
   - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

➡️ **Start recording.**

> [!TIP]
> After you start the recording, click the Show captions (CC) button to enable transcription for the recording.

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

# Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at [the prototype/etc], I'd like to learn a little bit about you. 

> [!TIP]
> - These are placeholder questions, but work well across a lot of situations. Adjust as you need for your study.
> - If it's a prior participant, consider skipping or modifying the intro questions or following up on something you previously learned from them.

1. Can you tell me about your current role at the VA and how long have you been at the VA?
2. How often have you been using [insert product]?
3. Can you breifly walk be through what your experience was like the last time you used [product or thing]?
4. What, if anything, was challenging about that experience? Why?
5. What, if anything, was straightforward about that experience? Why?

## Prototype Intro - Moderator Controls:
Next we’re going to look at a prototype of the [insert thing]. There are a few things I’d like you to keep in mind: 

- I’ll describe a scenario and then give you a set of tasks to complete using the prototype.
- This is a prototype and not the real application. [Non-coded interactive prototype: It closely matches the real application, but some things may not work as expected.] You may see placeholder information that doesn't match your own situation exactly and that's ok.
- I'm going to share my screen and you can tell me what to do, what to click, where to scroll. 
- There are questions that will ask to input information. When we get to these points, you can tell me what you would input, and then we'll move on. 
- As you're going through the prototype, please think aloud. I'd like you to say whatever comes into your mind. I'm interested in what's grabbing your attention on the screen, what questions you have, and your general thoughts as you review a page. 
- If at any point you feel uncomfortable or confused, please let me know. We are testing the designs and gathering feedback and not testing you. We’re here to support and learn from you. 
- If you have any questions as we go along, please feel free to ask me. I may not be able to answer them right away since we’re interested in how people would navigate this application without a helper around. But if you still have any questions when we’re done, I’ll try to answer them then.
- And please feel free to be as honest as possible – it won’t hurt our feelings. 

`PCP | Outpatient Scenario:`Imagine that you have a 68 year old patient who comes in for their routine semi-annual visit, and that you diagnose them with atrial fibrillation after an abnormal pulse was detected on physical exam, and a subsequent EKG confirmed AFIB. They are asymptomatic at the current time though their CHA2DS2-VASc score indicates they are at a higher risk for stroke and may need to start anticoagulation therapy. As such, you want to evaluate their HAS-BLED score to help you determine if anticoagulation therapy can be appropriate for them.

You navigate to the CDS Console, click on Medical Calculators, and select the HAS-BLED calculator which brings you to this screen.

`Emergency Department Scenario:`Imagine that you have a 68 year old patient who comes in for their routine semi-annual visit, and that you diagnose them with atrial fibrillation after an abnormal pulse was detected on physical exam, and a subsequent EKG confirmed AFIB.

# Emergency Exit 🚨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
