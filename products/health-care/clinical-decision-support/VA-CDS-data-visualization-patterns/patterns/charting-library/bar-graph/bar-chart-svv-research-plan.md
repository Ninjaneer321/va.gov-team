# Bar Chart and Single Value Visualization Research Plan


# Background:

During initial discovery with the CDSC app teams, the Data Visualization team identified Bar Chart and Single Value Visualization as patterns that could be used across apps to fulfill clinicians' need to quickly view data.


# Research Goals:



* To assess the overall usability of the Bar Chart and SVV as standalone patterns.
* To assess the usability and understandability of the Bar Chart being used alongside with the SVV.
* Identify opportunities for improvement in both patterns to inform guidance for app teams during implementation.


# Outcome:

This study will generate evidence on the usability and effectiveness of the Bar Graph and Single Value Visualization—individually, in combination, and across design variations—to determine how well these patterns support clinician comprehension and workflow, and to provide clear guidance for their implementation in CDS applications.


# Research Questions:



1. How easily can clinicians interpret and use the Bar Graph and SVV, both individually and together?
2. In what ways do these visualizations support or hinder comprehension, decision-making, and workflow?
3. How does combining the Bar Graph with the SVV affect clinicians’ ability to understand and act on the data?
4. Which design of the SVV is most effective at communicating meaning clearly and efficiently?
5. How easily can clinicians use the patterns on a small mobile sized screen?


# Methodology:

The Data Visualization team will conduct semi-structured interviews using interactive Figma prototypes of the My Work Week application enhanced with a Bar Graph and Single Value Visualization (SVV). Five users of My Work Week will participate in the study, providing feedback on the usability and effectiveness of the visualizations.


# Hypothesis:



* Clinicians will find the SVV useful in gathering quick information to plan out their work week.
* Clinicians will be able to easily interpret the information that is being presented on the Bar Charts.

# Research Materials:

# Recruitment:

Leverage assistance from the My Work Week team to make the introduction to their users. Use the MWW Support Tracking spreadsheet to contact clinicians that left feedback around bar charts. Recruit at least 5 MWW users (ideally of different levels).


# Outreach Email:

Hello _______,

My name is Ben and I’m part of a team of contractors working with the Clinical Decision Support Collaborative (CDSC) in partnership with the Veteran’s Health Administration (VHA) and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO). Together, we are working to improve clinical decision support (CDS) tools that are available within the VA to help clinicians provide best in class care for Veterans.

My colleagues from the My Work Week team have mentioned your interest in bringing back graphs to the My Work Week app. We are working on some new designs for graphs and would really appreciate your feedback on them. Would you be interested to participate in a 50 minute call to share your thoughts and feedback on some of our graph designs?

Your responses will remain confidential and your anonymity protected. If you are interested in participating, please review the schedule below and respond to this email with some options that work for your schedule. I'll follow-up with a Teams invite.

Monday, October 6th: 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM EST

Tuesday, October 7th: 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM EST

Wednesday, October 8th: 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM EST

Thursday, October 9th: 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM EST

Friday, October 10th: 10:00 AM - 5:00 PM EST

Thank you and I am looking forward to hearing back from you.
