# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Integration of VADS Components into Clinical Design System (Clinical DS) 
- **Start Date:** Aug 11, 2025
- **End Date:** _TBD_
- **Status:** In Progress

## Overview
The purpose of this PRD is to outline the detailed requirements for importing and integrating a net new VA Design System (VADS) component into the Clinical Design System (Clinical DS). This initiative aims to assess the feasibility of making VADS components compatible for CDS users and establish a repeatable process for future component integrations.

## Background


## Goals
- Assess the feasibility and compatibility of VADS components within the Clinical Design System.
- Establish a repeatable and efficient process for importing and integrating VADS components.
- Provide thorough documentation of the process, including estimation of effort, risk identification, change management, and component quality assessment.

## Out of Scope
- import a component that is currently in the Clinical Design System 
   - note: there will be an experiment 2 that addresses a Clinical DS component in use by a product team


## User Story
As the Clinical Design System, I want to import one net new VADS component so that I can assess the feasibility of making the component compatible for Clinical DS users.

#### Functional Requirements
1. Determine a suitable VADS component candidate for import
2. Import the selected VADS component into the Clinical Design System.
3. export the imported VADS component into the Clinical Design System.
4. perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT) on the imported component.
5. test the implementation with a pilot partner to ensure compatibility and functionality.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The imported component must not degrade the performance of the Clinical Design System.
- **Scalability:** The integration process should be scalable for future component imports.
- **Usability:** The imported component should be user-friendly and maintain or improve the current user experience within the Clinical Design System.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation must be provided for each step of the process, including the level of effort, risks, change management, and final assessment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

The goal is to make this a repeatable process with better estimation.
- Document the process with an estimated level of effort for each step
- Identify risks involved in each step of the process
- Document change management required with all teams involved
- Provide a synthesis of the process and final results, including the quality assessment of the integrated component

#### 5. Dependencies
- Availability of the selected VADS component for import.
- Collaboration with the VADS team for component integration and quality assurance.
