 
## Overview
Our team aims to create patterns for the authenticated experience that can be shared with USWDS and other federal agencies as an effort to support [OCTO objective](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202024.md): **Our people are empowered with the knowledge and resources they need to make sustained impact**, specifically the result of "Common processes, tools and decisions are documented and easily accessible to all staff."

## Problem Statement
How might we update existing, or create new patterns to improve clinician experiences in a way that is adaptable by USWDS and other federal agencies? 
 
## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans are able to more fully complete their VA.gov profiles
- Users providing personal data in an application that is then later used to complete additional applications

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans have a more difficult time filling out user profiles and other forms
- Users are confused about where their profile data lives and is used.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- 6 - 8 VA reusable patterns for personalized, authenticated experiences are created
- Patterns are as easy as possible to implement across products and teams
- Documentation for personalization patterns ready for integration into **both** https://design.va.gov and https://designsystem.digital.gov

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Less than 4 patterns are delivered
- Patterns are not sufficient quality to be adopted by existing VA.gov applications retroactively (e.g. code and patterns/flows do not easily replace/adapt to existing code and patterns/flow)
- Patterns are not sufficiently account for the value in (and build on) existing in-production solutions on VA.gov
- Patterns are not meet sufficient quality measures to be integrated into the USWDS

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Once fully adopted by VA teams, we expect these to be indicators of success:
- A 15% or greater theoretical reduction in VA custom code by end of project overall and/or measurable performance improvement
- 5% or greater theoretical increase in the percentage of users with completed profiles on VA.gov
- {{need a KPI to hit for increase in prefill usage}}

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
  - Lines of custom code removed from VA.gov (essentially replacing existing instances of current patterns with finalized versions)
  - Authenticated users using stored personal data to complete applications to benefits and services
  - Users providing personal data in an application that is then later used to complete additional applications
  - 4-6 patterns are created and presented to USWDS for consideration

## Assumptions
Based on existing research and priorities we have identified several potential candidate patterns. These include:
- [data grid] Help Users to parse through dense data quickly
- tbd

## Solution Approach
Our pattern prioritization matrix is based on the following factors:
- It is related to data visualization.
- It solves a specific Clinical Decision Support Collaborative (CDSC) problem.
- It is sufficiently abstract-able to be reusable across CDSC teams.
- It is sufficient quality and utility to be integrated into VADS.
- It is sufficient quality and utility to be integrated into USWDS.

Additional consideration includes:
- Dependencies on other teams.
- Dependencies on other patterns and components.
- Highest impact x feasibility

- *What are we going to build now, and why have we decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have we explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

  
### [Parse through dense data quickly with a data grid](#)
We believe this is a good pattern [add hypothesis reasoning] 

This pattern should consist of: 
- tbd
- tbd
- tbd

### Navigate as a clinician
We believe this is a good pattern [add hypothesis reasoning] 

This pattern should consist of: 
- tbd
- tbd
- tbd

### [Pattern tbd](#)
We believe this is a good pattern [add hypothesis reasoning] 

This pattern should consist of: 
- tbd
- tbd
- tbd
