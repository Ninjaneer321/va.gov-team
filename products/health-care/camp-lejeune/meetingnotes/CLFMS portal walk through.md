  - Walked through some screens of the application to process CLFMS claims.
  - This is a system that is owned and maintained by the FMS team, used
    to process all Camp Lejeune family member applications.
 - There is also a [public facing site](4/15/2024%20Introductory%20Meeting%20to%20understand%20the%20CLFMS%20system%20%28Camp%20Lejeune%20Famiy%20Member%20Portal%29.%20This%20is%20a%20system%20that%20is%20owned%20and%20maintained%20by%20the%20FMS%20team,%20used%20to%20process%20all%20camp%20leguguene%20family%20member%20applications.%20There%20is%20also%20a%20public%20facing%20site%20https://www.clfamilymembers.fsc.va.gov/App/StepApplicant)
 - There appears to be a way to upload document online, as well as get them via mail/fax
 - Premal asked for the volume of applicants that are received by this system (will send us a daily report).
 - Action item: CLFMP team will share the API spec that is being used to write the internal "portal" that the CLFMP program is using as their working system.  The OCTO IVC team will determine how feasable it is to connect VA.gov to this API to write to their portal.
- There is also an upcoming back end change to the "portal", to integrate with a system called "ECAMS" in 2025.
- Update (4/24), there is NO back end (API) integration for the CLFMP application, it is a direct database call, making integration very difficult.
- Volume for camp lejeune application is around 6500 applications received over 10 years.
