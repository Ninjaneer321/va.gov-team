# How we work [Draft]

## Basic ticket hygiene

### Issues/tasks
As you create and work on tickets make sure they are:
- [ ] Associated with an epic. [UX Epics](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1214/views/32) and [UAE Epics
- [ ] Assigned a team
- [ ] Labeled [needs-refinement](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/1214/views/20?filterQuery=label%3Aneeds-refinement) if you want to discuss and point them with the team during refinement.
- [ ] Assigned story points. You can add points to your work, or discuss during refinement for shared projects.

### Epics
Epics don't need story points. Make sure to add:
- [ ] The epic Type (note that this is different than a label or tag)
- [ ] The roadmap status

## Refinement and Planning
The team meets regularly to break down work and plan for the next sprint:
- Review high-level priorities and notes any changes.
- Review through board right to left and discusses any challenges with in-progress work or validation. Adjust sprint labels as needed to accommodate shifting priorities.
- Refine any tix with the `needs-refinement` label:
    - If you created a ticket you want the team to review add the `needs-refinement` label
    - Discuss with the team and add details or break down into smaller tickets if needed
    - Align on complexit of work and add story points
    - Move refined tickets to Ready status
    - Add assignees or note if anyone can pick up ticket
