# Expanding community care referrals list to display all referrals

## Context
We now have the ability to add all community care (CC) referrals into the referrals and requests page, and need to design for this scenario where some referrals shown might not have online scheduling. We are in the discovery phase of this process and have questions about the referal statuses (e.g. what are all the cases that would result in a referal being removed from the list??), the Veteran experience (e.g. do they get notifications about referral status changes?) and back-end processes (e.g. what is staff's process to handle referrals? Would it complicate their process if we provided a number for Veterans to call to schedule, rather than wait for staff to call them?). Below are some questions we'd like to discuss with IVC.

## Questions for IVC
- If an appointment can't be scheduled online, Veterans are told that their provider will reach out to them. However, we'd like to give them an option to take proactive steps, rather than wait passively. Are there any issues with us providing the CC provider phone number (or another number to call) if they feel that they've waited too long, or are antsy to schedule the appointment?
  - If Veterans must wait to be contacted, what actions can they take in the meantime (if any)?
- Currently, when a Veteran schedules the first appointment from the referral, that referral disappears. How are additional appointments scheduled from that referral? Does the provider call to schedule? 
-  Whatâ€™s the lifecycle of a referral? (What are all the stages or statuses a single referral goes through in the system?)
  - Does every referral have a consistent timeline it adheres to (ex: a referral has 2 weeks to exist and for appointments to be scheduled from)?
- Does VA have a timeline for when they reach out to Veterans to schedule? Does this happen within days, weeks, etc.?
  - If yes, how consistent is this timeline? Would it vary for any reason?
- Are there any actions a patient can take with an expired referral? Can they be revived in any way (on the backend/in the system or by the facility or care team)?
- When and why would a referral would be removed from the list? These are the scenarios we're aware of:
  - A: The referral was for 1 appointment and that appointment has been scheduled.
  - B: The referral was for a series of appointments and the first appointment has been scheduled. (You may have more appointments to schedule, but the referral goes away in the UI after the first is scheduled)
  - C: The referral expired without being scheduled.
- Questions about that:
  - Are there other cases we're missing? (E.g. Are referrals ever _withdrawn_?)
  - In each of the above cases, are those referrals ever visible to the user?
  - [For Kristen M:] Down the line, would it be possible to revisit the decision to hide those referrals?
- Are there any existing notification (email/text/snail mail) processes tied to referrals?
- We're interested in learning more broadly how staff handle referrals. Is that something you could walk us through? Is there a flow chart or process chart?
