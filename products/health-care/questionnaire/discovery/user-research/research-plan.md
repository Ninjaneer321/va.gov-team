# Research Plan for Healthcare Experience Team June 2020 
## Goals	
This research is for initial discovery for the Health Care Experience, Questionnaires team. 

**Background**

Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

The problem: As a Veteran, I’m unable to easily and quickly provide pre and post visit documentation in a digital and discrete format that can be shared across facilities and my care team.

**Research questions**
  - Do Veterans see forms/questionnaires as an acute problem or pain point?
  	- If yes, what are some current problems/pain points Veterans face when filling out information before visits?
  - Who do Veterans believe they are interacting with when they are filling out documents? (clinicians, docs, etc.)
  - What role do Caregivers have in relation to certain forms?
  - Which forms (if any) do Veterans see value in? What is that value? 
  - How do these forms fit into the Veteran health journey? How are they notified about the forms? When do they fill them out? (pre-visit, post-visit)
  - What do Veterans call these forms, questionnaires, etc.? 
  
**Hypothesis & assumptions**
- Hypothesis: Veterans may have assumptions about how their data is used and shared that may differ from reality (i.e. what happens to their data when they submit the clipboard, what they WANT to happen to their data.
- Hypothesis: Filling out forms is a pain point/redundant task. 
- Hypothesis: Veterans are asked to complete many different types of forms in different formats/delivery methods. 
	- Assumption: Veterans want an option to complete these forms digitally. 
- Caregivers will have a unique experience related to assisting filling out forms for Veterans.


## Method	
We will conduct remote interviews via Zoom using the Perigean contract.This method will allow us to understand various problems and bright spots Veterans and Caregivers currently face when preparing for doctor's visits. It will also help us understand which forms to prioritize as we determine the scope for our tool.

## Participants and Recruitment	
We would like to talk with 10 participants:
- At least one Caregiver
- At least 3 women
- Had an appointment at a VAMC in the last six months (Veterans who have had both in person and telehealth appointments encouraged)
- Has received primary or specialty care at a VA in the last year
- At least 3 participants between ages 24-40
- At least 1 with a Section 508 disability _(Review with Jennifer Strickland)_

45 minute sessions
