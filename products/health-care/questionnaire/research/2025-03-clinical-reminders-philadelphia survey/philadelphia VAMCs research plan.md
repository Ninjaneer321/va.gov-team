Results will inform decisions about enterprise-level questionnaire platform adoption."

# Philadelphia VAMCs research plan for staff/provider moderated interviews or surveys April 2025 

## Background   

 
The Clinical Reminder system helps clinical care staff deliver higher quality care to patients for both preventive health care and management of chronic conditions and helps ensure that timely clinical interventions are initiated. Clinical reminders as ensures that clinical care staff complete recommended screenings as validated by either a SME or a governing body like the USPSTF.  

 

## Research summary  

Philadelphia area VAMCs and CBOCs have been using the BHL questionnaire platform tool to send clinical reminders to patients before their upcoming primary care appointments. This research will use a survey to gather quantitative and qualitative data from PACT team clinical staff and pcps (primary care physicians). The goal of the survey is to assess the BHL tool’s ease of learnability and use, clinical workflow compatibility, and the interoperability between Power BI and CPRS software already in use at VAMCs.  

 

## OCTO Priorities   

- Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience 

- Improve Veterans’ healthcare outcomes with digital tools 

 

## Veteran Journey   

Taking care of myself through aging 

 

## Methodology   

- A survey link will be sent emailed to 4 cohorts for a total of 160 participants. We expect at least 50% will respond to survey. The participants will have 3 days to complete the surveys.  The cohorts will be as follows: 

   - Cohort 1: 40 Licensed practical nurses (LPNs) 
   - Cohort 2: 40 Medical support assistants /Advanced medical support assistants (MSAs/AMSAs) 
   - Cohort 3: 40 Licensed social workers (LICSWs) 
    - Cohort 4: 40 Primary care physicians (PCPs) 

 

## Research Questions  

- How easy was it to learn to use the tool?  

- How easy was the configuration/set up process for the tool?  

- How long did it take to learn to use the tool?  

- Would providers change anything about the training they received? If yes, what?  

- How easy is the tool to utilize?  

- Was data entry simplified?  

- Was notification fatigue reduced?  

- Was overall clinic reminder burden reduced?  

- Did the quality of the time providers spend with patients improve?  

- How much time do providers estimate was saved by collecting these clinical reminder responses prior to the appointment?  

- Were providers workflows affected either positively or negatively? If yes, how?  

- Do providers feel this process maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity?  

- How could the tools or experience be improved or changed?  

- Were participants aware of the “surrogate” feature before using the tool? 

- Was there an increase in Veteran positive responses with asynchronous clinical reminders versus responses that were gathered in-person? 

- On average, how often are Veterans' responses are not reviewed in a timely manner before a Veterans appointment? 

 
 

## Hypothesis   

- The tool will reduce overall clinical reminder burden for staff/providers, including data entry and notification fatigue.  

- Staff/providers will perceive asynchronous clinical reminders to be a safe way to gather this information from Veterans.  

- Staff/providers will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the BHL tool and their workflow. 

- Staff/providers will notice an increase in positive response with asynchronous clinical reminders versus response obtained during in-person. 

- At least 50% of staff/providers will not be aware of the full extent of the BHL “surrogate” feature. 

- All staff/providers will not review a Veterans' response before their appointment at least 1 time in a typical week. 

 

## Location   

Participants from Philadelphia area VAMCs and CBOCs will be emailed the survey link to their VA email.  

 

 

## Research materials   

- The MS Forms platform -TBD 

- Survey questions 

   

## Recruitment approach  

OCC will attain a list of all the Philadelphia are participant volunteers.  

 

## Length of sessions   

The survey questions will be around 20 questions not to exceed 15 minutes in time investment.  


## Recruitment criteria 

If the 50% threshold is not attained, 80 responses, then subsequent non-respondents will be sent the survey link via MS Teams message.
