# Research Design
methodology: "semi-structured-interviews"
research_format: 
  location: remote
  moderated: true
  
# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Understand Veteran feedback on the timing and delivery of clinical reminder questionnaires"
  - goal_2: "Evaluate the ease of use and understandability of the questionnaire tools"
  - goal_3: "Assess impact of digital questionnaires on appointment quality and Veteran responses"

research_questions:
  - "Would Veterans change anything about the timing of when they receive the questionnaire notification/link?"
  - "Did Veterans feel that they were given enough time to complete the questionnaires prior to their appointment?"
  - "How easy was the tool to utilize?"
  - "How much time do Veterans estimate it took them to complete the questionnaires?"
  - "How easy are the questions to understand?"
  - "Did answering these questionnaires impact the quality of their appointment with their provider in any way?"
  - "Did answering these questions online from anywhere impact Veterans' responses compared to answering these questions with their provider? How?"
  - "What is Veteran's preference for the number of clinical screeners to complete at one time via these experiences?"

hypotheses:
  - "Veterans will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the tool."
  - "The questions within each clinical reminder will be understandable."
  - "Answering the questionnaires will help to optimize the Veteran's time with their care provider."

expected_outcomes: "Collect Veteran feedback to compare BHL and eScreening tools and inform decision on clinical reminder digitization approach."

# Research Plan for Health Questionnaires, Clinical Reminders Pilot - Veteran Interviews, October 2023

## Background
“The Clinical Reminder system helps caregivers deliver higher quality care to patients for both preventive health care and management of chronic conditions, and helps ensure that timely clinical interventions are initiated.  
 
Reminders assist clinical decision-making and also improve documentation and follow-up, by allowing providers to easily view dates when certain tests or evaluations were performed and to track and document when care has been delivered. They can direct providers to perform certain tests or other evaluations that will enhance the quality of care for specific conditions. The clinicians can then respond to the reminders by placing relevant orders or recording clinical activities on patients’ progress notes.  
 
Clinical Reminders may be used for both clinical and administrative purposes.” 

[Clinical Reminders Manager’s Manual](http://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Clinical/CPRS-Clinical_Reminders/pxrm_2_mm.pdf)

The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools. This study will collect Veteran feedback on the tools.

### OCTO Priorities 

- Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
- Taking care of myself through aging

## Research Goals	
- Would Veterans change anything about the timing of when they receive the questionnaire notification/link? 
- Did Veterans feel that they were given enough time to complete the questionnaires prior to their appointment? 
- How easy was the tool to utilize? 
- How much time do Veterans estimate it took them to complete the questionnaires? 
- How easy are the questions to understand? 
- Did answering these questionnaires impact the quality of their appointment with their provider in any way? 
- Did answering these questions online from anywhere impact Veterans’ responses compared to answering these questions with their provider? How? 
- What is Veteran’s preference for the number of clinical screeners to complete at one time via these experiences?
  
### Hypothesis
- Veterans will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the tool.
- The questions within each clinical reminder will be understandable.
- Answering the questionnaires will allow help to optimize the Veteran’s time with their care provider.  

## Methodology	
Moderated semi-structured interviews with Veterans. 

### Location
Sessions will take place via Zoom meetings. 

### Research materials
- [Link to conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/2023-10-clinical-reminders/conversation-guide.md)
- Demo Links
  - These links will be sent to the participant by BHL and eScreening prior to the session occurring. The links will be generated closer to the date of testing and after screener answers are collected.

## Recruitment
