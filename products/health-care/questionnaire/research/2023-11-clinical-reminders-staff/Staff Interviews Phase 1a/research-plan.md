# 2023-11 Research Plan for Health Questionnaire, Clinical Reminders Pilot - Staff Interviews: Phase 1a

[2023-11 Health Questionnaire, Clinical Reminders Pilot - Staff Interviews, November 2023 #504](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/504)

“The Clinical Reminder system helps caregivers deliver higher quality care to patients for both preventive health care and management of chronic conditions, and helps ensure that timely clinical interventions are initiated.

Reminders assist clinical decision-making and also improve documentation and follow-up, by allowing providers to easily view dates when certain tests or evaluations were performed and to track and document when care has been delivered. They can direct providers to perform certain tests or other evaluations that will enhance the quality of care for specific conditions. The clinicians can then respond to the reminders by placing relevant orders or recording clinical activities on patients’ progress notes.

Clinical Reminders may be used for both clinical and administrative purposes.”

[Clinical Reminders Manager’s Manual](http://ttps://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Clinical/CPRS-Clinical_Reminders/pxrm_2_mm.pdf)

The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools. This study will collect Veteran feedback on the tools.

## Research Goals	
- How easy was it to learn to use the tool? 
- How easy was the configuration/set up process for the tool? 
- How long did it take to learn to use the tool? 
- Would providers change anything about the training they received? If yes, what?  
- How easy is the tool to utilize?  
- Was data entry simplified? 
- Was notification fatigue reduced? 
- Was overall clinic reminder burden reduced? 
- Did the quality of the time providers spend with patients improve? 
- How much time do providers estimate was saved by collecting these clinical reminder responses prior to the appointment? 
- Were providers workflows affected either positively or negatively? If yes, how?
  - Do providers feel this process maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity? 
- How does BHL compare to eScreening for each requirement? Which tool is preferred? 
- How could the tools or experience be improved or changed? 
- What was the final process for sending, receiving, and reviewing these questionnaires implemented at each location? 

### Hypothesis
- The tool will reduce overall clinical reminder burden for providers, including data entry and notification fatigue. 
- Providers will perceive digital questionnaires to be a safe way to gather this information from Veterans. 
- Provider will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the tool. 

## Methodology	
Moderated semi-structured interviews with providers.

### Location
Sessions will take place via Microsoft Team meetings.

### Research materials
- [Link to conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/2023-11-clinical-reminders-staff/conversation-guide.md)

	
## Recruitment	
10-15 staff members 

- A minimum of three providers per pilot clinic 
- At least one nursing staff member 
- A minimum of one Healthcare System Technical Administrator (HSTA) and/or Clinical Application Coordinator (CAC) per pilot location
- One Toxic Exposure Screening (TES) Navigator at each pilot location
- At least 2 staff members must have reviewed positive screener results
- At least 2 staff members must have reviewed negative screener results
- At least 1 staff member must have reviewed both positive and negative screener results  

### Planned dates of research:
These interviews will be scheduled once a pilot clinic: 
- Receives a minimum of 5 positive and 5 negative responses to each self-screener  
- Receives a minimum of 20 overall self-screeners.  
- At 60 days, we will also evaluate scheduling if we haven’t hit these criteria. 

### Length of sessions
- Session length: 1 hour 
- Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes 
- Maximum Sessions per day: 3

### Research sessions
- Planned dates of research
