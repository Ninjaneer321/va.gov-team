# Research Findings for Health Questionnaire, Clinical Reminders Veteran Interviews pilot 1b staff interviews, November 2023
The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools. This study will collect Veteran feedback on the tools.

**Finding 6:**

**Recommendation:** 
 <br>
 
**Finding 7:** 
**Recommendation:** Reevaluate the terminology used to reassure users that their care teams will address their responses during their healthcare appointment.
 <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 8:** 6 out 15 found the questionnaire was "just the right amount" in length. 5 out of 15 Veterans were frustrated with the length mostly due to not seeing the questions as relevant to their appointment. Most stated the questionnaire should be kept to 10 minutes in length. 

> P9: *"It depends. In this scenario, I’m taking it before I go to a new clinic or provider. I would say no more than 5 to 10 minutes."*

> P8: *"There wasn’t too many. It was just questions that needed to be answered. If there were more questions that needed to be answered, then I would answer them."*

**Recommendation:** Keep the survey to 10-15 minutes to avoid frustrations or questionnaire abandonment.
 <br> 
 <br>
 
**Finding 9:** Overall, no usability issues were observed with the BHL tool. In eScreening, 2 out of 7 people initially thought the “Save and Exit” button is how you continued to the next page. 1 participant had extreme difficulty utilizing the eScreening mobile UI.

> P10: *"Do you want me to hit 'Save and exit”?'"* (he believed that to move to next screen you have to save this screen and exit.)

> P5 (Assistive Tech User): *"Tell them that you can save and exit...So you know they know that they don't have to fill it out all at once."*

> P5 (Assistive Tech User): *"Immediately, this is like not super mobile friendly… I noticed that the words were cut off, and I had to scroll in the box instead of on the page…for my screen,…for accessibility,…I have the letters turned up really high. So, naturally, everything is bigger for me, and these are way smaller than what is on my screen. So, it didn't even adapt to the accessibility feature on my phone."*

**Recommendation:** Prioritize design work to explore UI or content solutions to address the eScreening concerns.
 <br> 
 <br>

## Secondary Findings

**Secondary Findings 1:** 5 out of 15 participants mentioned they would like to either review or print out a summary of their responses, so they can share with them their non-VA providers.

> P2: *"I probably would ask for a printout what of what my responses are, simply because I have what they call dual coverage with the VA. And private health insurance...I see some doctors outside of the VA.” *eScreening

> P1: *"It would be nice to see the answers I had flagged, like a summary report, or answers that you may follow up with. I would like a copy of these answers in my file that I answered these questions."* BHL 
 
**Recommendation:** Investigate additional ways for Veterans to receive a summary of their responses.
 <br> 
 <br>
 
**Secondary Findings 2:** 4 out of 15 participants mentioned they’d like see their provider’s information listed in the notification and “Welcome" screen, not only for security reasons, but also, to help them identify which of their many appointments the questionnaire pertains to.

> P5: *"I have cyber security awareness…I would know that this is probably really coming from the VA just based on everything that's on here...But if somebody’s… [is] not as tech savvy… they can't like tell us that's something legit or not...They might not immediately click on that link. They might just ignore it completely. I would know it's legit, but at the same time…I still would hesitate to just click on and filling my personal information.”*

> P1: *"I would like to know which provider this is for; Sometimes I see 2 providers per week.”*

**Recommendation:** Explore opt-in capabilities that VeText has for appointment reminders to show an additional data point in SMS message. Revisit the content displayed on the Welcome screen.
 <br> 
 <br>

**Secondary Findings 3:** Some participants, 3 out of 15, would like both the notification, and the questionnaire, to contain information on the length of the questionnaire and whether it can be resumed once started.

> P9: *"Having a busy schedule…I need to answer these questions. [It would be helpful to know] it's going to take…X amount of time. I could plan a little bit better.”*

> P5: *“Talk about the ‘save and exit’ at the bottom…tell people…if you start this at any time… you don't necessarily have to finish it [in one sitting]. Cause I know filling out some surveys…you have to do it all at once. I want to know that before I started, because sometimes you can't do it again or [if] the link expires.”*

**Recommendation:** In the notification, include the estimated time to take the questionnaire and whether link can be reused once the link has been clicked on.
 <br> 
 <br>

**Secondary Findings 4:** 2 out of 8 BHL participants found the sexual orientation to be very sensitive information that should only be shared with their healthcare providers.

> P13: *"Very sensitive...I would like a disclaimer saying this information will only be shared with your provider."*

**Recommendation:** Explore adding a disclaimer with the question stating that sexual orientation info will only be shared with healthcare team.
 <br> 
 <br>

**Secondary Findings 5:** 2 out of 8 BHL participants believed the sexual orientation questions were irrelevant to their healthcare appointment. One participant believed that gender identity was part of sexual orientation, and they did not differentiate between the two.

> P8: *"I don’t know what the purpose of this question is...I’m not sure what their sexual orientation has to do with their preventative care."*

> P6: *“What a shame has the country come to this that this is a question for a medical appointment?... When I signed up to for the VA, it was obvious that I was a male. I don’t know why I need to keep answering these questions.”*

**Recommendation:** Explore adding a brief disclaimer as to why sexual orientation questions are relevant within this context.
