    Onboarding included a Teams meeting, a channel for follow-up questions, weekly touch point for questions, and "additional" training materials. This structure seemed adequate for staff.
  - "The eScreening tool had technical issues during onboarding which caused delays in the roll-out; this resulted in an unnecessarily long onboarding process and created stress for staff. [Note: Finding appears truncated in source document]"
  - "When staff was asked to rate the ease of learning and the use of the tool, BHL averaged 1 (very easy) and eScreening averaged 4 (difficult); however, the challenges in learning eScreening were attributed to technical problems rather than the tool's design. [Note: Finding appears truncated in source document]"
  - "eScreening had substantial technical problems during the entire course of Phase 1b; eScreening caused so much disruptions to staff's workflow that Minneapolis was forced to abandon the tool. [Note: Finding appears truncated in source document]"
  - "At least 3 participants found BHL to integrate well into existing tools and processes; and had a positive impact on staff's workflow. On the other hand, the eScreening staff had difficulties integrating the tool into their workflow. [Note: Finding appears truncated in source document]"
  - "Almost every eScreening participant stated the tool complicated their data entry. For example, eScreening's processes for sending and receiving notifications were unnecessarily laborious. [Note: Finding appears truncated in source document]"

    Some participants noted that neither tool made difference in alleviating their clinical reminder burden when rooming patients. However, some BHL staff said their workload was improved, while most eScreening staff said their burden increased:
    - BHL Users:
      - 1 saw no change
      - 1 noted a reduction
      - 1 was delighted
    - eScreening Users:
      - 1 saw no change
      - 2 said burden increased
  - "Even though most staff liked the idea of having the screeners sent out to Veterans, they wished for digitizing more screeners to save staff time and increase the quality of time spent with patients. [Note: Finding appears truncated in source document]"
  - "Overall, 4 out 5 participants believed BHL and eScreening maintained a level of safety and clinical integrity."
recommendations:
  - "Keep the training process the same."
  - "Make sure the tool set up is complete before training staff."
  - "Explore automating as many steps/processes as possible in the screener software to simplify staff's data entry."
  - "Do further research to determine whether more questions added to screeners would make a difference in time savings during rooming. In addition, since the pilot screeners were not fully integrated, conduct research on fully integrated screeners. [Note: Recommendation appears truncated in source document]"

# Research Findings for Health Questionnaire, Clinical Reminders Veteran Interviews pilot 1b staff interviews, November 2023
The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools. This study will collect Veteran feedback on the tools.

## How this research maps to the Veteran journey
- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Retiring
- Aging
   <br> 
 <br>

## Research goals
The goal of this researh is to gather staff feedback during the crossover phase; participants were asked to compare the 2nd tool to having no tool,  and then they were questioned on how the tool used in the crossover phase compared to the 1st tool that they used:
- Compare and contrast the BHL screening to with the eScreening tool.​
  
- How easy was it to learn to use the tool?​

- How easy was the configuration/set up process for the tool?​

- How long did it take to learn to use the tool?​

- Would providers change anything about the training they received? If yes, what?​

- How easy is the tool to utilize?​

- Was data entry simplified?​

- Was notification fatigue reduced?​

- Was overall clinic reminder burden reduced?​

- Did the quality of the time providers spend with patients improve?​
  
- One tool will be preferred over the other tool to reduce overall clinical reminder burden for providers, including data entry and notification fatigue.​

- Providers will perceive digital questionnaires to be a safe way to gather this information from Veterans.​

- Providers and staff will identify areas to improve the ease of use for both tools.
   <br> 
 <br>
 
## Hypothesis
- One tool will be preferred over the other tool to reduce overall clinical reminder burden for providers, including data entry and notification fatigue.​

- Providers will perceive digital questionnaires to be a safe way to gather this information from Veterans.​

- Providers and staff will identify areas to improve the ease of use for both tools.

## Methodology
This study used a crossover trial methodology in this part of the pilot.​ Phase 1a was at Minneapolis, Minnesota using BHL, while Butler, Pennsylvania utilized eScreening. This research is phase 1b the crossover phase; thus, Butler used BHL, while Minneapolis switched to eScreening.​
<br> 
 <br>
​
### Site selection

Two primary care clinics in Minneapolis, Mnnesota and Butler, Pennsylvania were chosen as the pilot locations using the following criteria:​

- No previous exposure to BHL and eScreening​

- Leadership capabilities​

- High PACT Act staffing ratio​

- The site volunteered
<br> 
 <br>

### Staff interview criteria​

To gather staff feedback on Phase 1b, staff involved in the pilot volunteered to participate in 30-45 minutes interview sessions via MS Teams.​ Sessions were scheduled after Phase 1a concluded. The requirements to end Phase 1a were:​

- 180 questionnaire responses received​

- 60 days passed
 <br> 
 <br>
  
### Recruitment
Pilot staff volunteered to be interviewed. 
 <br> 
 <br>

### Dates of Sessions 
- April 18-April 25, 2024
<br> 
 <br>
 
### Research Sessions
30-minute moderated interview sessions via the Zoom platform.
<br> 
 <br>

### Participants 
- 6 Total participants in Phase 1b​

    - 2 Staff Members using BHL​

      - 1 Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN)​

      - 1 Advanced Medical Support Assistants (AMSA)​

    - 4 Staff Members using eScreening​

      - 2 Nurse Managers​

      - 1 Toxic Exposure (TES) Navigator: no access to BHL in phase 1a​

      - 1 Clinical Applications Coordinator (CAC):no access to BHL in phase 1a​

**Note:** 2 phase 1a participants did not participate in Phase 1b interviews​ and there were 2 new participants who interviwed in Phase 1b who were not interviewed in Phase 1a​

## Key findings

 [Detailed research findings report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/2023-11-clinical-reminders-staff/Staff%20Interviews%20Phase%201b/Research%20Findings%20Staff%20Interview%201b%20Clinical%20Reminders.pdf)

**Finding 1:** Onboarding included a Teams meeting, a channel for follow-up questions, weekly touch point for questions, and "additional" training materials. This structure seemed adequate for staff’s needs. 1 staff member commented that they believe training received during Phase 1a for the other tool was helpful and made training easier for Phase 1b
       
**Recommendation:** Keep the training process the same.
  <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 2:** The eScreening tool had technical issues during onboarding which caused delays in the roll-out; this resulted in an unnecessarily long onboarding process and created stress for staff. Consequently, the nurse manager did not include their LPNs in the pilot to shield them from disruptions in their workflow, especially during staff shortages.

**Recommendation:** Make sure the tool set up is complete before training staff.
  <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 3:** When staff was asked to rate the ease of learning and the use of the tool, BHL averaged 1 (very easy) and eScreening averaged 4 (difficult); however, the challenges in learning eScreening may have been due to staff experiencing technical issues during onboarding. 
<br> 
 <br>
 
**Finding 4:** eScreening had substantial technical problems during the entire course of Phase 1b; eScreening caused so much disruptions to staff’s workflow that Minneapolis was forced to abandon the pilot two weeks early because they felt the tool to be too unreliable to continue using it.
<br> 
 <br>
 
**Finding 5:** At least 3 participants found BHL to integrate well into existing tools and processes; and had a positive impact on staff’s workflow. On the other hand, the eScreening staff had difficulty integrating the screener into existing tools and workflows; they had to select the non-count clinic and remember to push the screener responses to that clinic.
  <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 6:** Almost every eScreening participant stated the tool complicated their data entry. For example, eScreening’s processes for sending and receiving notifications were unnecessarily laborious and time consuming; in contrast, the BHL staff mentioned their data entry workload either stayed the same, or it slightly decreased due to BHL’s automated reminder emails to staff.

**Recommendation:** Explore automating as many steps/processes as possible in the screener software to simply staff's data entry.
<br> 
 <br>
 
**Finding 7:** Some participants noted that neither tool made difference in alleviating their clinical reminder burden when rooming patients. However, some BHL staff said their workload was improved, whereas some eScreening staff reported an increase workload. 

- BHL Users ​

   - 1 saw no change ​

   - 1 noted a reduction ​

   - 1 was delighted

-  eScreening Users​

   - 1 saw no change​ ​

   - 2 said burden increased​  
 <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 8:** Even though most staff liked the idea of having the screeners sent out to Veterans, they wished for digitizing more screeners to save staff time and increase the quality of time spent with patients.

**Recommendation:** Do further research to determine whether more questions added to screeners would make a difference in time savings during rooming. In addition, since the pilot screeners were not frequently in use, such as the TBI and the embedded fragments screeners, look into whether including high frequency/volume reminders (such as the flu, etc.) would make a difference in time savings, instead adding more reminders to be screened online.
<br> 
<br>
 
**Finding 9:** Overall, 4 out 5 participants believed BHL and eScreening maintained a level of safety and clinical integrity.
