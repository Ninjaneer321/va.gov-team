# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:

  - goal_2: "Assess impact on provider workflows, data entry burden, and notification fatigue after extended pilot period"
  - goal_3: "Determine which tool is preferred and identify areas for improvement"

research_questions:
  - "Compare and contrast the BHL screening to with the eScreening tool."
  - "How easy was it to learn to use the tool?"
  - "How easy was the configuration/set up process for the tool?"

  - "Was data entry simplified?"
  - "Was notification fatigue reduced?"
  - "Was overall clinic reminder burden reduced?"
  - "Did the quality of the time providers spend with patients improve?"
  - "How much time do providers estimate was saved by collecting these clinical reminder responses prior to the appointment?"
  - "Were providers workflows affected either positively or negatively? If yes, how?"
  - "Do providers feel this process maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity?"
  - "How does BHL compare to eScreening for each requirement? Which tool is preferred?"
  - "How could the tools or experience be improved or changed?"
  - "What was the final process for sending, receiving, and reviewing these questionnaires implemented at each location?"

hypotheses:
  - "One tool will be preferred over the other tool to reduce overall clinical reminder burden for providers, including data entry and notification fatigue."
  - "Providers will perceive digital questionnaires to be a safe way to gather this information from Veterans."
  - "Provider will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the tool."

expected_outcomes: "Gather comprehensive provider feedback comparing BHL and eScreening tools to inform final decision on clinical reminder digitization approach for provider workflows."

# 2024-04 Research Plan for Health Questionnaire, Clinical Reminders Pilot - Staff Interviews: Phase 1b.

“The Clinical Reminder system helps caregivers deliver higher quality care to patients for both preventive health care and management of chronic conditions, and helps ensure that timely clinical interventions are initiated.

Reminders assist clinical decision-making and also improve documentation and follow-up, by allowing providers to easily view dates when certain tests or evaluations were performed and to track and document when care has been delivered. They can direct providers to perform certain tests or other evaluations that will enhance the quality of care for specific conditions. The clinicians can then respond to the reminders by placing relevant orders or recording clinical activities on patients’ progress notes.

Clinical Reminders may be used for both clinical and administrative purposes.”

[Clinical Reminders Manager’s Manual](http://ttps://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Clinical/CPRS-Clinical_Reminders/pxrm_2_mm.pdf)

The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools. This study will collect Veteran feedback on the tools.

## Research Goals	
- Compare and constrast the BHL screening to with the eScreening tool.
- How easy was it to learn to use the tool? 
- How easy was the configuration/set up process for the tool? 
- How long did it take to learn to use the tool? 
- Would providers change anything about the training they received? If yes, what?  
- How easy is the tool to utilize?  
- Was data entry simplified? 
- Was notification fatigue reduced? 
- Was overall clinic reminder burden reduced? 
- Did the quality of the time providers spend with patients improve? 
- How much time do providers estimate was saved by collecting these clinical reminder responses prior to the appointment? 
- Were providers workflows affected either positively or negatively? If yes, how?
  - Do providers feel this process maintains an appropriate level of safety and clinical integrity? 
- How does BHL compare to eScreening for each requirement? Which tool is preferred? 
- How could the tools or experience be improved or changed? 
- What was the final process for sending, receiving, and reviewing these questionnaires implemented at each location? 

### Hypothesis
-  One tool will be preferred over the other tool to reduce overall clinical reminder burden for providers, including data entry and notification fatigue.
- Providers will perceive digital questionnaires to be a safe way to gather this information from Veterans. 
- Provider will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the tool. 

## Methodology	
Moderated semi-structured interviews with providers.

### Location
Sessions will take place via Microsoft Team meetings.
