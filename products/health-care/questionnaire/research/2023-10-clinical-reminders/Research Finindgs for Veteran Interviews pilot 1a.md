# Research Findings for Health Questionnaire, Clinical Reminders Veteran Interviews pilot 1a, November 2023
The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools. This study will collect Veteran feedback on the tools.

## OCTO DE goals that this research supports

## Research goals
-  Would Veterans change anything about the timing of when they receive the questionnaire notification/link?
-  Did Veterans feel that they were given enough time to complete the questionnaires prior to their appointment?
-  How easy was the tool to utilize?
-  How much time do Veterans estimate it took them to complete the questionnaires?
-  How easy are the questions to understand?
-  Did answering these questionnaires impact the quality of their appointment with their provider in any way?
-  Did answering these questions online from anywhere impact Veterans’ responses compared to answering these questions with their provider? How?
-  What is Veteran’s preference for the number of clinical screeners to complete at one time via these experiences?

## Hypothesis
Veterans will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the tool.
The questions within each clinical reminder will be understandable.
Answering the questionnaires will allow help to optimize the Veteran’s time with their care provider.
