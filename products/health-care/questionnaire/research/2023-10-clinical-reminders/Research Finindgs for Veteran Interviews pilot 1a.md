# Research Findings for Health Questionnaire, Clinical Reminders Veteran Interviews pilot 1a, November 2023
The volume of clinical reminders has been impacting the quality of the time the patient spends with the provider. Providers have also reported increased burden due to data entry and notification fatigue. Therefore, Veteran Health Administration (VHA) is in search of a tool that allows customizable and standardized health forms, screeners, and questionnaires to be sent to the patient to collect responses asynchronously. Through an earlier evaluation, it was identified that VA already has two digital questionnaire tools within our ecosystem, Behavioral Health Labs (BHL) and eScreening, that can meet many, but not all our process and technological needs. OCC, OCTO, and VHA program offices agreed to complete a pilot to gather more insight to compare the tools. This study will collect Veteran feedback on the tools.

## Research goals

The goal of this researh is to discover the following:
-  Would Veterans change anything about the timing of when they receive the questionnaire notification/link?
-  Did Veterans feel that they were given enough time to complete the questionnaires prior to their appointment?
-  How easy was the tool to utilize?
-  How much time do Veterans estimate it took them to complete the questionnaires?
-  How easy are the questions to understand?
-  Did answering these questionnaires impact the quality of their appointment with their provider in any way?
-  Did answering these questions online from anywhere impact Veterans’ responses compared to answering these questions with their provider? How?
-  What is Veteran’s preference for the number of clinical screeners to complete at one time via these experiences?
   <br> 
 <br>
 
## Hypothesis

-  Veterans will identify areas to improve the ease of use within the tool.
-  The questions within each clinical reminder will be understandable.
-  Answering the questionnaires will allow help to optimize the Veteran’s time with their care provider.

## Key findings

**Finding 1:** Most Veterans do not differentiate between the many pre-visit products/questionnaires currently available.

-  Past Experience with pre-visit questionnaires
    - Pre-visit-summary: Unclear
    - Pre-check-in: 6
    - Clinical reminders: Unclear
      
-  Modality
     - Online with notification: 4
     - Phone call: 2
     - Waiting room: 2
     - PCP in room: 1
     - 
**Recommendation:** Combine the pre-visit-summary, clinical reminders, and pre-check-in into one digital experience for the Veteran to complete before their appointment.
  <br> 
 <br>

**Finding 2:** 14 out of 15 participants found their past experience answering pre-appointment questions to be adequate; they spoke about the time required to answer questions, the timeframe the notification was received, and the notification modality.

-  P14: *"I did feel pressured when I was given them (questionnaires) on a clipboard, so when you get them in advance, at least you have a chance to give it a little more thought."*

-  P7: *"I would say… a week before my appointment...And that's just to give [me] more flexibility…And also it gives me time to think."*

-  P10: *"Sometimes it's easy to lose a text message; but…if it's in your email, it's there.”*

**Recommendation:** Send Veterans their first pre-appointment questionnaire notification 5-7 days prior to their appointment. Ask Veterans for their questionnaire notification preference (email, text, etc.) and utilize the preference when sending the questionnaires.
