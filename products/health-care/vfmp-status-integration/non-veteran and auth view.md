# VFMP Status Integration – My VA Experience Overview by User Type

This document summarizes the user experience considerations for the VFMP Status Integration project, specifically around how veterans and non-veterans interact with My VA.

- The platform treats veterans and non-veterans the same, so no special handling is needed based on that distinction alone.
- Verified vs. not-verified is the most important differentiator for what a user can see.
- Not-verified users may still be able to see some form statuses, but this varies by form.

## Veteran vs. Non-Veteran View

There is **no meaningful difference** between the logged-in experience of a Veteran and a non-Veteran on VA.gov / My VA. All sections are available on My VA to Veterans and non-Veterans.

Both account types are identical at the platform level. The differences show up in how content populates based on users' actions. For example, a non-Veteran will not see a Veteran-only form submission, because they would never have filled one out.

**Additional notes:**

- The system has a Veteran indicator, but this shouldn't be the only way used to identify a Veteran. If this indicator is missing, that doesn't mean the person isn't a Veteran — the system just doesn't have records of it at that time.
- MPI (Master Person Index) tracks relationships between people (like a Veteran and their dependent), but it labels both sides of the relationship the same way. You have to use other data to figure out who is the Veteran and who is the dependent.

## Authenticated vs. Unauthenticated Experience

There are 3 experiences users may have based on their level of authentication and furthermore verification.

### Verified (Authenticated)

- Identity has been confirmed by a credential provider such as Login.gov or ID.me.
- Once verified, VA.gov pulls the person's record from MPI and displays all available information on My VA.
- Users have access to all sections and features on My VA. Content is displayed based on whether they have a benefit, not based on Veteran/non-Veteran status.

### Not Verified (Authenticated)

- The user has an account but has not completed the identity verification process. They do not have a record in MPI.
- Only the name and email registered are displayed.
- However, some forms can be completed and submitted by unverified users. They can save a form in progress and may be able to see a status for that form after submission. This varies form by form.
- Not-verified users may still be able to see some form statuses. This varies form by form, so each one should be checked individually.
- Some actions, like editing or completing a form, may require the user to verify their account before proceeding.

### Unauthenticated (Not Logged In)

- Users cannot access My VA at all. Clicking the My VA link prompts them to sign in.
- No personalized data is displayed.

## Questions for the Future

- What percentage of Veterans have verified accounts compared to non-Veterans?
  - Are non-Veteran users more or less likely than Veterans to have verified accounts?
