# Initiative Brief Template
#### Overview

For decades, when a patient was checked in, clinical staff rightfully assumed that a patient has arrived, checked in with MSAs, and is now sitting in the clinic waiting room ready to be called back for their appointment.  

With the introduction of eCheck-in in early 2022, Veterans could check in remotely from their smartphones, initially, 15 minutes before their appointment, which has since increased to 45 minutes since Veterans are often told by clinical staff and MSAs to arrive quite early before their appointment. eCheck-in shows the patient as checked in inside VistA and VSE-CS, but they do not have to be physically in the clinic waiting room. 

This new change has caused clinical staff to lose patients, patients going to the wrong floor/clinic, miss appointments, wait longer than anticipated if eCheck-in wasn't completed, etc. There have even been discussions about removing eCheck-in altogether to resolve these issues.

**Is there value in patients using eCheck-in to complete pre-registration (and having the option to file a travel reimbursement claim) and have their check in status updated in VistA (knowing that MSAs find eCheck-in helpful to speed up lines in the clinic waiting rooms), but require Veterans to "check in" with an MSA to resolve these known concerns?**

Would this resolve each of those concerns or add burdens we haven't considered for the Veteran, clinical staff, or MSAs?

Further complicating these issues, clinics aren't required to use PCI and VSE-CS (PCICSV). And, not all clinical staff and MSAs are trained on how PCI and VSE-CS work.

## Problem
- _What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?_
  - Veterans using eCheck-in without mandating clinical staff and MSAs to use VSE-GUI and VSE-CS to review a patient's check in status and understand that although checked in, they might not be in the clinic, has caused clinical staff to lose patients, patients going to the wrong floor/clinic, miss appointments, wait longer than anticipated if eCheck-in wasn't completed, etc.
  - Veterans using eCheck-in at clinics who's clinical staff and MSAs aren't using VSE-GUI and VSE-CS to monitor patient check ins are frustrated that VA's digital services aren't working as expected, causing mistrust, missed appointments, wait longer than anticipated to see their provider, etc.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
