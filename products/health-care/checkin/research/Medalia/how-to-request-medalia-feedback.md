## How to Collect and Process Feedback

1. Contact Center will email the feedback to the address you provided.
2. Download the spreadsheet to your machine on the VA network. 
3. Rename the spreadsheet in the following format (this lets us sort all the feedback files by date):
   `CIE Medallia [YYYY] Q[#] Week[##]` 
   For example: CIE Medallia 2024 Q1 Week 3
4. Scrub the feedback of PII/PHI. Read through every user comment and replace personal information with asterisks or number symbols. Replace data with codes as follows
   - Email addresses - PII_EMAIL
   - Names - PII_NAME
   - Social security numbers - PII_SSN
   - Phone numbers - PII_PHONE
   - Other identifying info - PII_OTHER
5. Copy the scrubbed spreadsheet data as a new tab in this spreadsheet: [CIE Medallia Analysis](https://dsva.slack.com/files/U046DTUBACX/F06SEMUUF0E/approved_sample_questions.xlsx)
