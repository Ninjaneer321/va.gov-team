## Key Insights

- **Veterans understood the type of claim they can file using this tool**
  - 90% of 60 Veterans understood that this tool can be used for mileage-only travel reimbursement claims and that they need to use the BTSSS portal to file claims with receipts
- **Veterans understood which claims they were filing when reviewing the tile checkbox design component**
  - 98% of 60 Veterans understood how many/which claims they are filing when selecting facilities
- **Veterans understood how to use the tile checkbox design component to file a separate claim for each of their appointments at different facilities today**
  - 88% of 60 Veterans  understood how to file a claim for any of the facilities NOT selected on the facility selection page
- **In the absence of information on the page about which appointments (e.g., past or upcoming) you can file a claim for, outside of the one's that were listed on the page, many Veterans did not understand they can't use this tool to file claims for past appointments**
  - 35% of 60 Veterans did not understood they can't use this tool to file claims for past appointments

## Breakdown of Response Data

| Questions  | After reviewing the information in the image, what type of claims can you file in this tool? | How can you file claims with receipts?  | Which claim(s) does it seem like you're filing for in this tool?  | Which claim(s) does it seem like you're NOT filing for in this tool?   | If you wanted to file your remaining claim(s) later today, how would you do that? | If you wanted to file your remaining claim(s) next week, how would you do that?  | Total |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Have filed before:** Veterans that have filed for VA health care travel reimbursement  | 86% (37/43) | 92% (33/36) | 98% (42/43) | 88% (38/43) | 98% (42/43)  | 67% (29/43)  | 88% (221/251)  |
| **Not filed before:** Veterans that have not filed for VA health care travel reimbursement  | 88% (15/17)  | 100% (15/15)  | 100% (17/17) | 88% (15/17)  | 94% (16/17)  | 59% (10/17)  | 88% (88/100) |

| **All Veteran participants:** Veterans that have and have not filed for VA health care travel reimbursement  | 87% (52/60)  | 94% (48/51)  | 98% (59/60)  | 88% (53/60)  | 97% (58/60)  | 65% (39/60)  | 88% (309/351)  |

## Recommendations
The content results of this study were not directly applied to our application due to a change in the business rules around which and how many appointments can be filed each day. However, we were able to use this feedback towards a different version of this page, in which Veterans choose between two appointments at the same facility. 

- Ensure clear information is included for which appointments you can file a claim for using this tool vs. BTSSS.
