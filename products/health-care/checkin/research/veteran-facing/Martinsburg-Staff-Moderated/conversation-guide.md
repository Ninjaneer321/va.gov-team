# Conversation Guide: Questions for Staff to ask Veterans

# This research study was attempted, but it proved difficult to have MSAs help us gather feedback. As a result, we changed methodologies and planned an on-site visit to gather this feedback/reach these same research goals. The new research plan can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/StLouis-pilot-feedback).

## Assets
- [Interactive PDF](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/8051757/StLouis-Veteran-Feedback.pdf)

- [Optimal Sort survey for St. Clair CBOC](https://ows.io/qs/6t86mt8w)
- _Do not click on the Optimal Sort link, because it will capture your findings as a participant entry. But, this is the link that we can send to staff._

## Questions
- Did you check-in for your appointment on your mobile phone today?
  - If the Veteran answer "no" or "I don't remember," ask the following questions:
    - Did you see a poster [name the location of the poster at MVP site letting you know that you could use your mobile phone to check-in?
      - If yes, was there a reason that you did not check-in on your mobile phone?
    - Thank you very much for your feedback.  
  - If the Veteran answers "yes," ask the following questions
    - Is this your first time checking in with this mobile experience?
    - Did you use the QR code or send a text? Why did you choose that method?
    - How long did you wait to receive the check in link via text message?
    - Did you need to make any changes to your contact information? If yes, tell me about the process.
    - Do you have multiple appointments today? If yes, how were these displayed on your mobile device?
   - On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
    	- What did you like and dislike about the experience of checking in on your mobile phone?
