In-Person Travel Reimbursement Research for Oracle Health Facilities
======================

[DRAFT]

## Background

Patient Check In's (PCI) online check in application for medical appointments introduced a feature for Veterans to file a beneficiary travel (BT) mileage-only claim during the check in process, which piloted in June 2023 at Wilkes-Barre Health System. At the end of the first month, 96% of claims submitted were paid or still in manual review.

As a result of its early success, the BT feature in online check in had a national release in December 2023, which accounted for ~20k BT claim submissions by the end of the year, i.e., opening another viable, efficient means for Veterans to utilize their benefits.

In January 2024, the PCI team learned that VA Facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software (instead of VistA) have different needs than VistA facilities, and there is not significant value for offering e-Check in at Oracle Health sites. This mvp initiative, therefore, aims to offer the most value by allowing a Veteran to submit a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim using low-risk authentication, without needing to complete eCheck-in. This will be the only focus for MVP.

Veterans who have health appointments at VA facilities that use OH EHR software (formerly CERNER) will be able to submit a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim.

### OCTO Objectives

### Veteran Journey


## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans on the travel reimbursement feature on ease of use and what, if any, expectations were unmet, specifically around travel reimbursement tasks.

### Research Questions (Veterans)
#### Primary Questions - UAT for Beneficiary Travel
-   From the posters and marketing materials, how well do Veterans understand how to initiate the claim process?
-   How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to initiate a claim?
-   Is there any confusion around initiating a claim via "text travel" compared to other methods of initiating claims at VistA facilities ("text Check-in" or 45 minute reminder message)? 
-   How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to complete their claim?
-   Do Veterans understand how to select and file claims for appointments at multiple facilities?
-   Do Veterans understand if/how claims are filed for facilities that are selected, vs. those that are not selected? (is this just a repeat of the question above? ðŸ‘€) 
-   Do Veterans understand this process allows them to file for ONLY mileage, and how to proceed if they need to file with receipts for any of their appointments?
-   What is the overall Veteran response to the "text travel" experience compared to other methods of filing? 

#### Secondary Questions - Understanding Check-in Ecosystem at Cerner facilities
-   What process do Veterans currently follow to check in at OH sites?
-   What are the current pain points for the check-in process at OH facilities?
-   Where are opportunities for improvement from the Veteran point of view?

### Research Questions (Staff)
#### Primary Questions - UAT for Beneficiary Travel
- **MSAs**
  -   How has the "text travel" method affected MSA workflow?
  -   What feedback have they received from Veterans about the "text travel" process?
  -   How has the travel reimbursement feature impacted the Check-in process?
- **Travel office staff**
  -   How has the "text travel" method affected travel office staff workflow?
     -   How has the "text travel" method affected the number of claims filed?
     -   How has the "text travel" method affected the number of denied claims?

##### Secondary - Understanding Check-in Ecosystem at Cerner facilities
-   What process does staff currently follow to check Veterans in at OH sites?
-   What are the current pain points for the check-in process at OH facilities?
-   Where are opportunities for improvement within check-in (preparing for and attending appointments) from the staff point of view? 
-   Is there a process at Cerner facilities for Veterans to check in on their own?

Method
------

This research will be conducted through Veteran intercepts and in-person interviews with staff at [FACILITY]. Our preference is to visit various clinics during times of high appointment check-ins.

We will work with facility contacts to determine the best approach for Veteran intercepts, and plan to intercept Veterans near travel posters before or after their appointments (depending on availability), and observe as they go through the travel reimbursement filing process. After assisting those Veterans through the filing process, we will ask them a few questions to get feedback on the experience.

We will also ask MSAs questions from our conversation guide to better understand the check-in ecosystem at Cerner sites and document responses, comments, improvements, etc.

1 or 2 researchers will be conducting this research.
