In-Person UAT for Travel Reimbursement on Smartphone at VA Oracle Health Facilities  
======================

## Background

Veterans who have medical appointments at VA health facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software (formerly CERNER) have a need to be able to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim on the day of their appointment. 

While there is a roadmap for including pre-check-in and eCheck-in at facilities using Oracle Health EHR software, the greatest value right now for Veterans and patient tracking at clinics is to offer Veterans the ability to file a mileage-only travel reimbursement claim using VA's Low Risk One Time Authentication (LoROTA) to streamline the "sign in" process for Veterans. 

The online travel reimbursement feature for smartphones will be piloted at a VA health facility that's use of Oracle Health is mature. E.g., Portland or Columbus. We will be collaborating with Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) on selecting a pilot facility and scheduling an in-person research visit.

## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to **get user acceptance feedback from Veterans and staff on the travel reimbursement feature's ease of use, identification of any challenges created for staff, and what, if any, expectations were unmet.**

## Hypotheses

### Research Questions (Veterans)

#### Primary Questions - UAT for Travel Reimbursement on Smartphone 
1. How do Veterans find out about filing a travel reimbursement claim by texting travel to 54804? 
   - Most Veterans will not know about this modality for filing a travel reimbursement claim. 
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to initiate a claim?
   - Veterans will find it extremely easy to initiate a claim, but some will have difficulties because of cellular reception. 
3. How easy or difficult is it to complete filing a claim?
   - Veterans will find it extremely easy to file a claim from their smartphones. 
4. How easy or difficult is it to file more than 1 claim? (If applicable.)
   - Veterans will find it extremely easy to file more than 1 claim in a single form. 
5. Which step of the process was most difficult to understand or challenging?
   - Veterans may not have known about this tool or had difficulties because of cellular reception and/or data coverage. 
6. Do Veterans understand how to file a claim with receipts?
   - Most will miss finding that information because it's not top of mind.  
7. What would Veterans change about this process to make it easier?
   - Veterans will want to be able to file a claim using this tool for a past appointment.  

### Research Questions (Staff)

#### Primary Questions - UAT for Travel Reimbursement on Smartphone 

##### MSAs
1. What feedback have MSAs or Clinic Managers received from Veterans about the new online travel reimbursement for smartphones tool?
   - MSAs and Clinic Managers will have feedback from Veterans that it's an extremely helpful and needed tool. 
2. How has it impacted your work or workload, if any?
   - MSAs and Clinic Managers will mention that they receive questions on occasion, which adds to their responsibilities. However, they're able to quickly direct them to contact the Travel Office.
3. How has the clinic or facility helped Veterans learn about filing a travel reimbursement claim by texting travel to 54804?
   - Posters have been placed at the exits of clinics and entrances of facilities.
     
##### Travel Office staff
1. What feedback have travel assistants or Travel Office managers received from Veterans about the new online travel reimbursement for smartphones tool?
   - Travel assistants and Travel Office managers will have feedback from Veterans that it's an extremely helpful and needed tool. 
2. How has it impacted you (or your staff's) work or workload, if any?
   - There are a lot more travel claims coming in that require manual review, which naturally increases staff workload. However, the number of complicated manual reviews is a small portion. 
3. What changes and/or issues have you (or your staff) noticed from recently submitted claims, if any?
   - There are more claims that require manual review.

Method
------

This research will be conducted through Veteran intercepts and in-person semi-structured interviews with clinic and Travel Office staff. Our intention is to visit various clinics, at busy times, to see what differences exist between clinics and different types of clinics. 

We will work with IVC and facility leadership to determine the best approach for Veteran intercepts, but ideally plan to intercept Veterans after check out. While observing Veterans as they go through the travel reimbursement filing process on their smartphones, we will assit as needed, and ask them a few questions to gather feedback on their experience.

We will also ask MSAs and Travel Office staff questions from our conversation guide to better understand the check-in ecosystem and impact of the new travel claim tool on their workload, while documenting those findings.

1 or 2 researchers will be conducting this research.
