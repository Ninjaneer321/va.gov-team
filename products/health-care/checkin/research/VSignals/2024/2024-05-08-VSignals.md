> I like text check in and filing travel claim at the same time.  It is about time it wS easy to get the claim.<br>
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center*

> I arrived about 20-25 minutes before my scheduled appointment. I was able to check in online as soon as I arrived, and, as a result, the technician came out to take me to my procedure before actual scheduled time. In fact, I was finished with my scan before the actual scheduled time. I think this kind of efficiency that can be provided by the online check-in process may help some with the workflow<br>
*- Chattanooga VA Clinic*

> I was able to check in online before I arrived at the facility therefore enabling me to be seen early. Security guard friendly but made sure I was the named person on ID!<br>
*- Cambridge VA Clinic*

> I was able to check in electronically and saw the tech about 10 minutes after my appointment time. <br>
*- McAllen VA Clinic*

> I am happy with my experiences at VA San Jose Clinic. Everyone is helpful and it is easy to check in by phone.<br>
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center*

> New function to check in and apply for travel pay over smartphone is AWESOME. Folks working there were very professional and courteous.<br>
*- Kalispell VA Clinic*

> Online check-in was much appreciated and helped expedite the appointment. <br>
*- Palm Bay VA Clinic

> I like the way I can check in online., and always get seen quickly. Everyone is professional and friendly.<br>
*- Lee County VA Clinic*

> Being able to check in with my cell phone was new for me and I found it very convenient. Good move. And doing Travel Pay on the cell phone was very easy.  Another improvement in the way things can be handled.
*- Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Kettles VA Medical Center*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> Need to fix the text system that requests you check in online. After checking in online the text indicated I would receive a call when they were ready. After 15 mins of waiting, the clerk at the window told me the text system does not work and that I had not been checked in. Provider and her Nurse were great!<br>
*- New Braunfels VA Clinic*

> When I arrived at the complex, the VA. App sent me a text asking if I wanted to check in. One I was in the waiting area for my CT scan, I checked in via that link. After about 25 minutes of waiting, I went to the reception window. The male was rude, talked over me and told me that although I used the app to check in, they donâ€™t get that information and it wasnâ€™t his problem.<br>
*- Boise VA Medical Center*

> The online check in works most of the time but there have been instances where I checked in on my phone but the receptionist had no record of my checking in. As a result, my appointment was skipped and I ended up being a walk-in, having to wait an extra hour to be seen.  Additionally, this last time, April 25, I could not file for my travel.  It was the first time it would not accept it.<br>
*- Olin E. Teague Veterans' Center*

> I checked in online, but when I arrived to the clinic, I had to check in again at the desk. I waited at least 15 minutes to get checked in and the nurse brought me back to my appointment. It wasnâ€™t clearly laid out if I had to check in at the desk after checking in online<br>
*- Viera VA Clinic*

> 40 minutes prior to my appointment, I checked into the eye clinic using the text that was sent to my phone.  It reflected that I was checked into the clinic.  My appointment time arrived and I had not been seen.  I then ask the lady at the desk what the problem was. She informed me that the on line check in does not work in the eye clinic!  I then waited another 20 minutes to be seen for my appt.<br>
*- Durham VA Medical Center*

> Lab apt. was at 1400. I arrived by 1340 and received text as I got out of my vehicle asking if I wanted to check in. I followed the link in the text and checked in. ... So I got up to the lab and sat down waiting for a Lab Technician to call me forward. None ever did. I eventually hit the "Blood Draw" button and got a number. Then I was called forward. .. Why did I bother checking in?<br>
*- Omaha VA Medical Center*

> Twice now I have waited over 30 minutes past my appointment after using auto check in. I was told not to use auto check in when I have a nurse appointment. There is no indication of this issue when checking in.<br>
*- Lee County VA Clinic*

**Trouble navigating larger facilities, specifically, where to check in and find their provider (e.g., when the check-in station is not close to the clinic) or after completing eCheck-in, there’s limited information on how to find the clinic**

> Get proper rook identification, I had an appointment at room 250, and it was on the 3rd floor. Extremely confusing and frustrating going up and down halls and elevators to locate where I check in at.<br>
*- South Oklahoma City VA Clinic*

> Whenever I have to see the audio. and check in the kiosk always says wrong area. It has been doing this for months. It needs to be looked into<br>
*- Lance Corporal Dana Cornell Darnell VA Clinic*

> "When the appointment was first scheduled I was given directions to where in the building to go. When I arrived and tried to check in there I was directed to a different location. I'm a bit confused with follow on tests. I've been scheduled for a follow-up to a test that I haven't been scheduled for, let alone attended."<br>
*-Ioannis A. Lougaris Veterans' Administration Medical Center

> Navigating the hallways looking for a clinic with no signs for the department I was heading to (neurology in this case) made it harder than it needed to be to find the place to check in.<br>
*- Doris Miller Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center

> I remember when I first walked in not being sure which desk was the main check-in desk (if one of them actually is the main one). It could be a little more clear whether one counter is the main check-in desk or if you can check in/out at any counter.<br>
*- Massaponax VA Clinic

> Arived at the VA 10 minutes early. Everything that was on paper about  where to go and and what team he was assigned to had all changed. Trailers were locked, no clue where to go. Found a worker who took us from one check in desk to another until Dad's name came up, in new offices in the Spine center.  By then it was almost 2 pm so his appointment had to be rescheduled. Takes an hour to get there<br>
*- James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital*

> "I arrived at blood draw in the basement.When I got to the person to draw she told me that I was in the wrong place and that I needed to go to bldg 79.  I got up to leave, she told me to sit down and drew me, bitching the whole time that it was my fault. If the old check in sudses still in place none of this would have happened!  The new and improved replacements do not work and are not in place."<br>
*- Minneapolis VA Medical Center*

> So here I am again bringing up a complaint, had GI consult this morning 8am arrived 745am, after having gone to GI surgery department and redirected (no problem), green desk check in, redirected to Orange path, GI-Diabetes-Dermatology departments, first patient there, double checked in, waited 5-10 minutes, got weighed and blood pressure, waited thirty minutes watching other patients come and go<br>
*- Dayton VA Medical Center*

> After you check in there is no information about where to go in the building. I checked in, in the parking lot and had to figure it how to get to the clinic on my own. It was on the second floor but I was not told that it given a suite number.<br>
*- Henrico County VA Clinic*

> No signs for the Same Day Clinic at the Palo Alto clinic in Bldg 5. Had to ask for directions and check-in was at a different location. Very confusing. Once I got in treatment was fine.<br>
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center*

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> My husband's appointment was for the 8th of April at 1330.  We arrived at the Walzem Clinic at 1310.  When my husband went to check in, he was told his provider, Dr. Brammer did not come in that day. No one contacted us. I asked when he could be seen and was told the provider did not have any openings until 20 May at 1000.  I think that's unacceptable, it was NOT our error.  Not happy with Walzem.<br>
*- Walzem VA Clinic*

**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**

> **The only problem I had with my visit at Loma Linda Veterans Administration was the check in desk. The [redacted] there told me there was a line and to wait before I even approached the desk to check in. The [redacted] seemed overwhelmed and after waiting several minutes there was a line of four people formed. I could not wait any longer and went directly to my clinic to check in and told the staff about it.<br>**
