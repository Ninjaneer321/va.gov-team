_E.g., not inclusive of all comments._

**Positive feedback about online check in, travel reimbursement and 45MR** 

> Make the telephonic check-in and mileage available at all times.
*- Olin E. Teague Veterans' Center*

> I want to thank the VA for making self check in so easy and including travel pay option, it was so easy!
*- Alvin C. York Veterans' Administration Medical Center*

> The Ft. Thomas facility is an old one. Entering the building you walk directly INTO an elevator.  My appt is in the basement.  Luckily I can check in on my phone.  My appointment was for 0900.  At 0915 still wasn't seen. I went to check and at 0920 Dr. Bucci said the receptionist thought my appt was 0930.  She isn't much help.  Have had several issues w her service in the past.
*- Cincinnati VA Medical Center-Fort Thomas*

> I noticed that when I have an appointment at the main VA hospital, I can check in for my appointment using my phone and I can claim my travel claim, but when I'm at the clinic I cannot. Why the difference?
*- Loma Linda VA Clinic*

> I enjoyed the text that signed me in for appointment, no need to wait in a line.  Extremely convenient check in. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. My consultation went very well, nutritionist explained everything very well and signed me into an app that will help me monitor my calorie, protein and carbohydrate consumption. A real game changer to help me possibly get in control of my weight.
*- Oxford VA Clinic*

> I like the check in with the smart phone and travel pay option.
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center*

> "Got a text which allowed me to check in by phone, entered the facility 5 minutes prior to appointment  and called in on time.
*- Bangor VA Clinic*

> My appointment was w dermatologist. The nurse was very polite and engaging. The doctor asked me if I had any concerns since my last visit which I did not. We discussed my previous treatments. She conducted a thorough exam and treated several spots on my arms."
*- New Orleans VA Medical Center*

> I think the text check in was great, but I was only one out of about 7 or 8 veterans that used it. May need to make the sign bigger or announce the service.
Travel reimbursement software is not very easy to follow or use.  The new automatic travel expense filing when you check in is great.  Well done!
*- Lee County VA Clinic*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**
> The doctor that I saw was very attentive and made me fell valued. I have only one complaint and its probably my fault more than the hospital. i checked in on line and felt that I was good to go, but when I didn't get called for over 45 minutes past my appointment I checked with the receptionist only to find out that i needed to check in at the desk. I'll know that in the future
*- Pittsburgh VA Medical Center-University Drive*

> Need better training for the people who check you in. I was told I was checked in and they would call my name when ready. 45 minutes late I received a phone call asking if I was there and I needed to check in.
*- Omaha VA Medical Center*

> "When I arrived 20 minutes early, my cell phone 'auto check in' came to life and, thanks to my preregistration, informed me I was all checked in and the clinic was notified.
50 (FIFTY) MINUTES LATER I went to the window and asked why the delay.
Dee, the checkin clerk on duty, had not been notified by the system and had reported me as a no show. 5 minutes later I was speaking to the Nurse.
I won'"
*- Pickens County VA Clinic*

> I utilized the phone checkin option and found that folks who checked in, in person, after me, were seen before me. Not a big deal, after half an hour, I approached the desk and asked about it. They saw that was checked in but for some reason, I was not called. Phone checkin may have some issues to work out but itâ€™s a convenient option to use if the bugs get worked out.
*- Austin VA Clinic*

> Make it a little easier to check in. You made the check in on line but you still have to go to the window to tell them you are there. What is the point of the mobile check in?
*- South Oklahoma City VA Clinic*

> When I arrived at the VA parking lot I received an email asking me if I had arrived and If I would like to check in, which I did. The problem is wherever the email was sent from never notified my provider that I was there and waiting. This seems to be an ongoing problem. Thankyou
*- Samuel S. Stratton Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*

> "Checked in via cell phone. I followed the instructions, checked in and had a sit in the lobby as instructed per check-in instructions on the text/app. After sitting for a minute or so I was called to the front desk to check-in again.
If I need to check-in at front desk regardless if I check-in by phone there should be instructions to do so or not allow phone check-in for clinics requiring ID."
*- Atlanta VA Clinic*

**Trouble navigating larger facilities, specifically, where to check in (e.g., when the check-in station is not close to the clinic) or after eCheck-in there’s limited information on how to find the clinic**

_End-to-end Veteran journey, e.g., feedback not isolated to PCI_

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

**Concerns with check in at kiosks**

**Facilities still using QR Codes, which shouldn't be used**

**Conflicting instructions to Veterans in appointment reminders**
