> Make the telephonic check-in and mileage available at all times.
*- Olin E. Teague Veterans' Center*

> I want to thank the VA for making self check in so easy and including travel pay option, it was so easy!
*- Alvin C. York Veterans' Administration Medical Center*

> The Ft. Thomas facility is an old one. Entering the building you walk directly INTO an elevator.  My appt is in the basement.  Luckily I can check in on my phone.  My appointment was for 0900.  At 0915 still wasn't seen. I went to check and at 0920 Dr. Bucci said the receptionist thought my appt was 0930.  She isn't much help.  Have had several issues w her service in the past.
*- Cincinnati VA Medical Center-Fort Thomas*

> I noticed that when I have an appointment at the main VA hospital, I can check in for my appointment using my phone and I can claim my travel claim, but when I'm at the clinic I cannot. Why the difference?
*- Loma Linda VA Clinic*

> I enjoyed the text that signed me in for appointment, no need to wait in a line.  Extremely convenient check in. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. My consultation went very well, nutritionist explained everything very well and signed me into an app that will help me monitor my calorie, protein and carbohydrate consumption. A real game changer to help me possibly get in control of my weight.
*- Oxford VA Clinic*

> I like the check in with the smart phone and travel pay option.
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center*

> "Got a text which allowed me to check in by phone, entered the facility 5 minutes prior to appointment  and called in on time.
*- Bangor VA Clinic*

> My appointment was w dermatologist. The nurse was very polite and engaging. The doctor asked me if I had any concerns since my last visit which I did not. We discussed my previous treatments. She conducted a thorough exam and treated several spots on my arms."
*- New Orleans VA Medical Center*

> I think the text check in was great, but I was only one out of about 7 or 8 veterans that used it. May need to make the sign bigger or announce the service.
Travel reimbursement software is not very easy to follow or use.  The new automatic travel expense filing when you check in is great.  Well done!
*- Lee County VA Clinic*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**
> The doctor that I saw was very attentive and made me fell valued. I have only one complaint and its probably my fault more than the hospital. i checked in on line and felt that I was good to go, but when I didn't get called for over 45 minutes past my appointment I checked with the receptionist only to find out that i needed to check in at the desk. I'll know that in the future
*- Pittsburgh VA Medical Center-University Drive*

> Need better training for the people who check you in. I was told I was checked in and they would call my name when ready. 45 minutes late I received a phone call asking if I was there and I needed to check in.
*- Omaha VA Medical Center*

> "When I arrived 20 minutes early, my cell phone 'auto check in' came to life and, thanks to my preregistration, informed me I was all checked in and the clinic was notified.
50 (FIFTY) MINUTES LATER I went to the window and asked why the delay.
Dee, the checkin clerk on duty, had not been notified by the system and had reported me as a no show. 5 minutes later I was speaking to the Nurse.
I won'"
*- Pickens County VA Clinic*

> I utilized the phone checkin option and found that folks who checked in, in person, after me, were seen before me. Not a big deal, after half an hour, I approached the desk and asked about it. They saw that was checked in but for some reason, I was not called. Phone checkin may have some issues to work out but itâ€™s a convenient option to use if the bugs get worked out.
*- Austin VA Clinic*

> Make it a little easier to check in. You made the check in on line but you still have to go to the window to tell them you are there. What is the point of the mobile check in?
*- South Oklahoma City VA Clinic*

> When I arrived at the VA parking lot I received an email asking me if I had arrived and If I would like to check in, which I did. The problem is wherever the email was sent from never notified my provider that I was there and waiting. This seems to be an ongoing problem. Thankyou
*- Samuel S. Stratton Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*

> "Checked in via cell phone. I followed the instructions, checked in and had a sit in the lobby as instructed per check-in instructions on the text/app. After sitting for a minute or so I was called to the front desk to check-in again.
If I need to check-in at front desk regardless if I check-in by phone there should be instructions to do so or not allow phone check-in for clinics requiring ID."
*- Atlanta VA Clinic*

**Trouble navigating larger facilities, specifically, where to check in (e.g., when the check-in station is not close to the clinic) or after eCheck-in there’s limited information on how to find the clinic**

> Most recently they do not provide check in location unless I ask.  Itâ€™s a big facility and am generally concerned finding my appointment location, especially when I forget to ask what building and/or room.
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center*

> Checked in @ 8:45am for 9am appointment. Was told to wait in the main area. After going to the check in desk twice to see what the delay was, it was then I was told to go to the end of the hallway and to fill out a form on a clip board. At 9:35am, I was called to the acupuncture group and was told that she can only see 3 ppl.She left us alone in the dark with music, very uncomfortable. male/female
*- North West San Antonio VA Clinic*

> I knew that I needed to get into Bldg # 5 but I could not find a directory or a sign on the wall that said where to check in to chiropractor clinic .
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center*

> This was my first time going to the Southwest clinic. There are no signs to tell you what to do or where to go. I had to ask the guy making coffee what to do. Once I used the kiosk I was still uncertain about how things were supposed to happen. They call your number and afterwards you wait. I didn't know if my number would be called again after checking in or if they would call my name.
*- Southwest Las Vegas VA Clinic*

> I would have liked a little more info about what a "tilt table or stress test" involves before the appt. I was never given detailed info about getting there. 2215 Fuller Rd got us to the Emergency entrance where we parked then walked a long way to the other end to primary care. When we tried to check in, we were sent to the 7th floor. There they said no, we had to go to the 5th floor.
*- Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Kettles VA Medical Center*

> "An email told me the room number but it was a room not accessible to me without going to the check in desk in a room I didn't know and wandered around looking for.
I suggest giving the name of the overall section and waiting room number."
*- Fort Worth VA Clinic*

> The appointment for PACEMAKER never tells the patient where to check in,  It should direct us to check in at the cardiology desk.  They have a waiting room but the pacemaker waiting room has no check in area.  Always CONFUSING!
*- West Palm Beach VA Medical Center*

> Besides the long drive and a hard time figuring out where to check in, my visit was great compared to what I imagined. I was dreading my appointment and expected a crowded waiting room. It was not crowded at all. The entire visit was very relaxing. Nice people sharing war stories and thanking me for my service. The doctor and her nurse were very friendly and easy to talk to. I left feeling happy.
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center-Livermore*

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**
> My husband's appointment was for the 8th of April at 1330.  We arrived at the Walzem Clinic at 1310.  When my husband went to check in, he was told his provider, Dr. Brammer did not come in that day. No one contacted us. I asked when he could be seen and was told the provider did not have any openings until 20 May at 1000.  I think that's unacceptable, it was NOT our error.  Not happy with Walzem.
*- Walzem VA Clinic*

> MY APPOINTMENT FOR MAY 31  SHOULD HAVE BEEN 2 MONTHS AGO.  IT DID NOT HAPPEN AS SCHEDULING DROPPED THRU THE CRACKS.    IN OTHER WORDS NO FOLLOW UP FOR FUTURE ROUTINE APPOINTMENTS.   SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GO TO ANOTHER AREA TO CHECK OUT.   TAKE A COUPLE OF THE CHECK IN SITES AS CHECK OUT SITES AND TO CLAIM TRAVEL EXPENSE.
*- Portland VA Clinic*

> This appointment was cancelled by the clinic without notification to me. I drove the 30+ miles to the clinic to be told on check in that it was cancelled.
*- Elko VA Clinic*

> On April 15th, two future appointments were to be scheduled for October. I was given October 17, 2024, MD at 11:00 and RN for an injection at 11:30. On April 16th I received a check in notice for an appointment on April 17, 2024. It took 40 min  with two phone calls over two days to learn there was no Oct. apt with RN scheduled and that RN apt had been scheduled for April 17.
*- Carl T. Hayden Veterans' Administration Medical Center*

**Long wait times or no one at check in**

> No one was available for check in at the blood drawn for my appointment. Why schedule appointment, if we still need to check in and be seen by number.
*- Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans' Hospital*

> After arriving extra early for my checkin at the desk the sign in the front said stand behind this chair. There was nobody in view so other folks started coming in finally a woman says come around to the side. A lady waiting said the woman was yaking on the phone. After that I got checked in and called.
*- Pensacola VA Clinic*

> When I arrived at the VA Seattle I found that the location of the apointment had moved locations.  When I tried to use my phone to check in from the text app,  A message advised their was no record of me so I could not check in then the app timed out.  There was no receptionist to assist in check-in.  I called a number and left a message. At my appointment time I was finally able to check-in.
*- Seattle VA Medical Center*

> After entering with my wife, we were the only two people in the lobby. The receptionist made me stand in the Que for five minutes before she called me to the desk to check in for my appointment. She was not on the telephone so, there was no legitimate reason for such a long wait in an empty waiting area. The Doctor and the nurse are outstanding and I trust and respect him.
*- Palm Bay VA Clinic*

> I arrived for my 0800 appointment and I attempted to check-in. Unfortunately, the check-in office did not open on time for anyone to check-in. There were many people waiting for the office to open so they could check-in for their appointments (some of which were supposed to have started at 0730. The check-in office didn't open until almost 0800 and many veterans were checked in late.
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center*

> The only problem I had with my visit at Loma Linda Veterans Administration was the check in desk. The lady there told me there was a line and to wait before I even approached the desk to check in. The lady seemed overwhelmed and after waiting several minutes there was a line of four people formed. I could not wait any longer and went directly to my clinic to check in and told the staff about the
*- Loma Linda VA Clinic*

> Long wait times / long check in times.  3 clerks at the window, all on the phone rather than helping veterans in line
*- Naples VA Clinic*

> I waited almost 10 minutes to check in at the receptionist desk. I am asked to arrive 15 minutes before the appointment which I did/do just to wait nearly 10 minutes to be checked in. Unacceptable!
*- Sepulveda VA Medical Center*

> No one at check in.  No one at check out when done.
*- Birmingham VA Medical Center*

> Shorten wait times and improve signage to find the blue team check in location.
*- Corporal Michael J. Crescenz Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center*

**Conflicting instructions to Veterans in appointment reminders**

> I could really use more information on my appointment reminders. I've had several appointments where all I really knew was the time and place of the appointment. I've had multiple appointments where I check in at the same place and don't really know what it's for until after I'm at the appointment. On April 5th I had 2 appointments back to back. Which is this for?
