## Noteworthy Comments

_E.g., not inclusive of all comments._

**Positive feedback about online check in, travel reimbursement and 45MR** 

> Make the telephonic check-in and mileage available at all times.
*- Olin E. Teague Veterans' Center*

> I want to thank the VA for making self check in so easy and including travel pay option, it was so easy!
*- Alvin C. York Veterans' Administration Medical Center*

> The Ft. Thomas facility is an old one. Entering the building you walk directly INTO an elevator.  My appt is in the basement.  Luckily I can check in on my phone.  My appointment was for 0900.  At 0915 still wasn't seen. I went to check and at 0920 Dr. Bucci said the receptionist thought my appt was 0930.  She isn't much help.  Have had several issues w her service in the past.
*- Cincinnati VA Medical Center-Fort Thomas*

> I noticed that when I have an appointment at the main VA hospital, I can check in for my appointment using my phone and I can claim my travel claim, but when I'm at the clinic I cannot. Why the difference?
*- Loma Linda VA Clinic*

> I enjoyed the text that signed me in for appointment, no need to wait in a line.  Extremely convenient check in. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. My consultation went very well, nutritionist explained everything very well and signed me into an app that will help me monitor my calorie, protein and carbohydrate consumption. A real game changer to help me possibly get in control of my weight.
*- Oxford VA Clinic*

> I like the check in with the smart phone and travel pay option.
*- Palo Alto VA Medical Center*

> "Got a text which allowed me to check in by phone, entered the facility 5 minutes prior to appointment  and called in on time.
*- Bangor VA Clinic*

> My appointment was w dermatologist. The nurse was very polite and engaging. The doctor asked me if I had any concerns since my last visit which I did not. We discussed my previous treatments. She conducted a thorough exam and treated several spots on my arms."
*- New Orleans VA Medical Center*

> I think the text check in was great, but I was only one out of about 7 or 8 veterans that used it. May need to make the sign bigger or announce the service.
Travel reimbursement software is not very easy to follow or use.  The new automatic travel expense filing when you check in is great.  Well done!
*- Lee County VA Clinic*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

**Trouble navigating larger facilities, specifically, where to check in (e.g., when the check-in station is not close to the clinic) or after eCheck-in there’s limited information on how to find the clinic**

_End-to-end Veteran journey, e.g., feedback not isolated to PCI_

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

**Concerns with check in at kiosks**

**Facilities still using QR Codes, which shouldn't be used**

**Conflicting instructions to Veterans in appointment reminders**
