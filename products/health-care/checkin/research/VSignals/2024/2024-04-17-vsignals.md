Created: April 17, 2024

This is an analysis of Veteran feedback from VSignals on PCI from **March 26, 2024 - April 9, 2024**. 

Feedback from Veterans is captured in VSignals. This report queries VSignals for comments that mention "check in" and "travel reimbursement." In this date range, there were a total of **241** comments (that excluded responses for pharmacy and lab survey types). 

## Noteworthy Comments

_E.g., not inclusive of all comments._

**Positive feedback about online check in, travel reimbursement and 45MR** 

> I'm glad we can finally apply for mileage reimbursement at time of check-in for an appointment. This is so great and saves a lot of time with paperwork and computer time. Great idea. 

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> When arriving for lab work we are asked to check in by text. We sit in the waiting area for a lengthy time only to find out that we need to check in in person. No one bothers to explain that. 

**Trouble navigating facilities, specifically where to check in, which is where clinic information in VistA, if accurate, would be helpful to Veterans in appointment reminders and in PCI**

> Show the direction how to get to the doctor.

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> I was supposed to have an appointment on March 1, 2024, but when we arrived we were told there was no appointment for me on the schedule. The check-in clerk tried hard to get me an appointment and was able to schedule an appointment for me on March 14, 2024. I appreciate his efforts to reschedule me. 

**Concerns at Kiosk facilities**

> Kiosks seem to always have problems when checking in. Frustrating. 
*- North Charleston VA Clinic* 

**Clinics still using QR Codes**

> Please include the check-in QR code on the ground floor, or in the elevator, for your appointment. 
*- St. George VA Clinic*

**Interest in expansion of filing for travel via text**

> I could not check in via text so checked in via staff. But then could not put a travel claim in electronically and travel desk person had stepped away. Maybe have QR codes so Vet can scan to get link for the day.
