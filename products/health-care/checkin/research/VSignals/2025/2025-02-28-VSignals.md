## Noteworthy Comments
**Like PCI**

> The check in from my phone was very much appreciated option.<br>
*- Michael E. DeBakey Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, TX (580)*

> I was able to check in via my cell phone, that was great. I dropped off my broken glasses and it was so easy.<br>
*- Dallas VA Medical Center, TX (549)*

**Staff not using PCI even though Veterans are**

> The texted message to check in online showed I was checked in for labs and would be called by my appointment time (25 mins). I checked that message a couple of times and it continued to state I was checked in. 25 mins later when I hadn’t been called, I checked the message again which then said there was an error. I had to stand in a line for several minutes waiting to physically check in where I was told never to use the texted online check in because it never works in lab.  Had I known that, I probably wouldn’t have waited for 35 mins to have labs done. Stop sending the check in texts or correct the problem.<br>
*- Fayetteville VA Medical Center, AR (564)*

> I received a text message to check in online for my appointment - which I did.  It was not clear whether this was the only check-in that was needed or whether I needed to check in at the desk also (which was necessary).  More clarification as to the procedure would be appreciated.<br>
*- Chillicothe VA Medical Center, OH (538)*

> The text message I received allowed me to allegedly check in online for lab work. However, I noticed some time passed and when I inquired about it, the lady at the front desk said, oh that doesn't work, you have to fill out the paper.<br>
*- Bruce W. Carter Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (546)*

**Trouble navigating larger facilities**

> This was my first visit to the clinic.  The instructions via post card were very good; found building with no problem.  Entering was confusion, several people waiting already.  No clear instructions on finding where to check in.  A man caught my eye and showed me.  Still not clear on the procedure.  Finally got to a window and receptionist bordered on rudeness.  Muttered words, little contact and a general disregard for the patient.  We're not there for fun; most patients have a real concern for their health and shouldn't be treated without respect, but were.  On checkout, a different lady behind another window was the same way--rude.  I had to make a follow-up appointment and i felt she could care less, with a take it or leave it attitude.  No discussion or help.  All my experience with VA has been outstanding from first applying, to making appointment and my extensive hearing exam--all outstanding.  But the people with first and last contact with the patient were terrible.  Maybe President Trump had these two ladies in mind!  I think all patients/veterans should be treated with concern and respect, but as a 22-year vet, field-grade officer, I was shocked.  Enough said.<br>
*- Baltimore VA Medical Center, MD (512)*

> I checked in and was directed to go to the Pact 2 area I don't recall the exact verbiage but checked in 2 or 3 times to try and figure out where on the 2nd floor I needed to be.  The signs were not the same as what was displayed on the kiosk I checked in on.  I think the kiosk said a number but all the different areas are in letters, very confusing for a first timer.<br>
*- Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, CA (664)*

**Staff not contacting Veterans when appointments are canceled**

> On 03JAN25 I had a follow up appointment for my hearing aids.  As I pulled into the parking lot for the appointment, I received a message that my appointment for that day had been cancelled.  Literally 5-10 minutes before my appointment I was notified that it was cancelled. I immediately (03JAN25) called to reschedule.  The call went to voice mail, so I left a message, with all the pertinent information, to reschedule my appointment. More than a week later (around 10JAN25), the VA Scheduler called to reschedule my appointment.  It was rescheduled for 25JAN25. </br>
*- George E. Wahlen Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, UT (660)*

**Concerns with check in at kiosks**

> Put the kiosks for travel reimbursement back in. The paper ones are hard to fill out and use.<br>
*- North Las Vegas VA Medical Center, NV (593)*

> It is taking to long to receive our travel pay. When the kiosks were in place we would receive our pay in a few days, now it takes months to receive.<br>
*- Oklahoma City VA Medical Center, OK (635)*

> The kiosk to sign in is difficult to use all else was good<br>
*- Charlie Norwood Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, GA (509)*

> Bring back the kiosk for travel pay.<br>
*- Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans' Hospital, MO (589A4)*

> I feel that they should go back to when used to login on the computer screen, and also complete your travel on the screen, not going to an individual to check into your appointment and also fill out paper travel sheet.<br>
*- Pittsburgh VA Medical Center-University Drive, PA (646)*

**Facilities still using QR Codes**

> I feel its a great facility with good people.  A few recommendations: 1. be careful with over automation - There was a QR code to check in.  I don't recommend it.  2. long wait for appointments for example; I was told if it were not for a cancelation I would have to wait over two months to get an exam for pink eye.  Maybe have urgent care hours from 8-4?  Thanks for what you do!<br>
*- Bath VA Medical Center, NY (528A6)*

> First I didn’t know you can check in using a QR code, I checked into the building but the wrong entrance, I ask the receptionist about my travel pay, she said that since I checked in at desk I have to fill out the paperwork, it’s confusing so now I have the paperwork at home I have to fill it out and submit it you have my address so VA should do a better job on letting people know<br>
*- Malcom Randall Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, FL (573)*

**Long wait times at check in or no staff at check in counter**

> There was no one in the office for me to check into when I first arrived to the echo location. There were no signs explaining what I needed to do. I sit for sometime before someone came through and I could ask a question about where to go. The echo tech took personal cell phone call at the exact time. My appointment was, which could clearly be heard in the hallway where I was waiting.<br>
*- Jack C. Montgomery Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, OK (623)*

> More staff at the front desk to check in patients as well as more doctors and nurses are needed.<br>
*- West Los Angeles VA Medical Center, CA (691)*

> It takes too long to check into the lab - I waited more than an hour and a half, then l left the clinic and returned another day.<br>
*- Hampton VA Medical Center, VA (590)*
