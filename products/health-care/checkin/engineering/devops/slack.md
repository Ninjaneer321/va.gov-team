# Slack Channels

We have the following Slack channels in DSVA Slack for use in DevOps-related development tasks:

- [`#check-in-experience-devops`](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C06LVA4NGFM):
  - **Purpose**: For notifications/development/etc that's of interest only to DevOps engineers.
- [`#check-in-experience-devops-test`](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C06M83B0MG9):
  - **Purpose**: For developing Slack integrations and anything else noisy.
