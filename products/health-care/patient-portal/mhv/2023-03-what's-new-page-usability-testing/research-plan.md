# **Research Plan for UCD Team, What's New Page, March, 2023**

**Background**

Our project is a new What's New Page, which aims to be one central place to notify and communicate with Veterans about My HealtheVet website changes and alerts that are important for to them to know, while keeping consistent with VA Design Patterns and migration efforts. This is a new concept -that was developed through Stakeholder interviews and comparative analysis- that we hope to introduce to the My HeatheVet home page.

**OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information

**Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Joining
- Starting up
- Putting down roots
- Aging

**Research Goals**

The goals of this study are to:

- Identify any usability issues with the What's New Page flow, specifically with older Veterans.
- Assess user experiences with introduction of new major notification feature.
- Measure Veterans' expectations of the "new" tag timeframe.

**Research questions**

1. How will Veterans react to the new What's New Page flow?
2. Does the new flow improve the likelihood that the "What's New" link will be noticed and read?
3. Does the "new" tag help Veterans understand how recent a notification was posted?
4. Do Veterans feel having both a banner and "what's new" link necessary?
5. How often do Veterans log in and does that affect any of the features within the What's New Page?
6. If there were to be a log or archive within this feature, how to Veterans expect it to look and function? Is it necessary?

Finding the What's New Page:

1. How easy is it for Veterans to notice the "what's new" link?

Personalized Notifications:

1. Do Veterans understand how to find personalized notifications?
2. Is the page organized in a way Veterans understand?

Interacting with Notifications:

1. How do users interact with notifications and how do they feel about the format of them?
2. Do Veterans understand how to open a notification?
3. Do veterans understand the color categories of the notification cards?
4. Are the notifications clearly communicating any applicable CTA's or next steps?

Drop down What's New Page preview:

1. Are Veterans able to view the drop-down notification preview? Is the hover function easy to use or confusing?
2. Is this feature helpful or convenient to the user?

**Hypothesis**

Hypothesis 1: Older Veterans will tolerate the new What's New Page flow.

Hypothesis 2: The new notification feature will help Veterans understand changes and updates to the My HeatheVet website.

Hypothesis 3: Veterans will have a set timeframe for how long they expect a new notification to last.

**Methodology**

We will conduct moderated usability testing interviews in which we will ask users to navigate the prototype, observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

**Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
