## Introduction

### Overview of the Product 
Supply Reordering on VA.gov seeks to allow Veterans to order different medical device supplies on VA.gov, prior to launch, supplies such as masks and batteries were only available via mail and phone orders. 

The goal of this team after successfully launching CPAP supplies has been to add 3 additional device supply types to the form - nebulizers, TENS units and blood pressure monitors.

- 2023 onwards: a small group of OCTO team members worked on launching CPAP supplies on the tool in 2022, following this our goal has been to add other supply types and redesign the app to align better with the current design system and address open accessibility issues.
  

### Stakeholder Management
- Denver Logistics Center : Responsible for shipping out supplies, manage any issues with orders and our app uses their data to show Veterans details about previous orders/what supplies they have available to order. 
   - Primary Contact : Patrick Booth
   - Primary Engineering Contact : Alberto Haddock 
- We schedule a monthly meeting to check-in on progress with this work, for any in-between communication, we use Teams or email. 


### User Feedback & Research
- There have been 2 user research studies done on this work within the health portfolio so far.
- [Study 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/supply-reordering-tool/research/2024-03-Supply-Reordering-Research): A usability study to analyze the current experience of the app
- [Study 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/supply-reordering-tool/research/2024-04-Meds%20and%20supplies%20concept%20testing): A concept study test where combining this tool with the prescriptions/medications refill experience was explored. Why: In a previous study, there was an indication that Veterans think there's a connection between medical supplies and medications. As our team continues to iterate on the medical supplies reordering functionality to MHV on VA.gov, we need to understand where Veterans expect to find medical supplies on the auth MHV home page, and how similar or different Veterans think about medications and medical supplies. This thinking was ultimately deprioritized in favor of redesigning the current app without combining with medications as the bigger risk was the current issues with the app and there were bigger challenges in combining with medications.
