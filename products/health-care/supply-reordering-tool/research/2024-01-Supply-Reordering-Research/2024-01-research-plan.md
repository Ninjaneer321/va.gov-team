# Research Plan for Supply Reordering Usability Test, Health Portfolio, February 2024
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
- The Supply Reordering tool seeks to relieve the burden from the Veteran of going to DLC for reordering devices and filling out a form via mail, or calling to reorder their devices by going to VA.gov instead. DLC also has seen a drastic reduction in the use of their contact centers for supply reorders, which allows them to use their time towards other goals. You need to sign into VA.gov (authenticated) to place a re-order. The tool is currently an iteration of what was once a tool only for hearing aids and batteries reorders, we have now added CPAP supplies.

### OCTO Priorities 

This works hits several different OCTO priorities, but particularly the priority to increase availability of self-service tools,decrease time to outcomes
maximize satisfaction, reliability, availability, & security and enhance the Veteran logged-in experience. Eventually, we will be integrating this function into the MHV on VA.gov health portal. 

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? This product would fall into  "Taking care of myself". Usually supplies are needed for chronic conditions, supply reordering is a repeated process through the Veteran's lifetime/as long as they have a certain diagnosis. 

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

Goal 1: Understand how Veterans currently order and re-order supplies
Goal 2: Evaluate if the current form is understandable and useful across participants. 

### Outcome
We want to determine if the current process is serving Veterans' needs and is as intuitive as possible for the future state of this product. How can the process improve?

### Research questions

1. Are users able to navigate to the "Order CPAP supplies" page from an unauth and auth state?
2. What are user's reactions to and understanding of the current production tool?
	- Is it clear that the form my include hearing aid supplies and CPAP supplies?
	- Is it clear to users why some supplies are available and some are not?
3. How do people know when to reorder? - Understanding of proactive notification.
4. Are there reminders that are already happening? (Word, so you will hear about more than digital solutions)
5. Prioritization of other devices (might be more of a metrics review)  - Are we missing any?
6. How do Veteran find out about the device reordering process? Is it unique that VA provides this for free? Outside VA they would have to pay?
7. If a supply isn't available and you are told to talk to your provider, then how would you do that? (note: how many mention SM?)

### Hypothesis

Hypothesis 1 : Participants will look to search "CPAP supplies" and find the page from there, since there is no link in the header or health hub
Hypothesis 2 :  Participants will get through the tasks of ordering the supplies relatively easily 
Hypothesis 3:  Participants will want to know how to change supplies, or 
Hypothesis 4: Veterans probably look to see what shape their supplies are in to know when to reorder and/or are notified by their clinician.
Hyopthesis 5: Most likely there are no real reminders that are currently with clinician
Hypothesis 6: We will not really capture any other supplies outside of what DLC has requested us to add to the tools
Hypothesis 7: Veterans probably find out about the reordering process from their VA provider
Hypothesis 8: Most Veterans would probably call DLC or try to call their VA Medical Center to discuss changing supplies, likely with a number they already have.


## Methodology	

We will conduct remote usability and interview sessions on Zoom. The interviews will consist of a combination tasks and direct questions.
We will conduct the study in the staging environment. with a test user created specifically for the study. 
  
### Location
Will be remote on Zoom.

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

All participants:
- Have you been prescribed a medical device by a VA Medical Provider in the past 5-10 years?
- LOA Level 3
- Must be veterans or caregivers 
- Must have a computer or mobile phone and be willing to complete their sessions on this device
- Must be willing to share a web browser window on the Zoom call
- Must have a working microphone
- Must have Zoom downloaded to their computer or mobile phone prior to the session and know how to share their screen
- Must have signed into VA.gov or My HealtheVet, for any reason and need to know their login information 

Some participants:

- 4 people who use screen readers on desktop 
- At least 4 people with identify as having a cognitive considerations
- 6 people who can join the session from a smartphone
- At least 3 people who are 55+, but not more than 8
- 6 people who identify as a race other than White/Caucasian
- 6 people who identify as a gender other than male
- 8 people who currently receive health care through VA
- 4 people who don't currently receive health care through VA, but have other VA benefits.
  
  

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).
