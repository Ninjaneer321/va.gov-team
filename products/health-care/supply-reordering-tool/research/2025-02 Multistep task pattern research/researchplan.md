	# Research Plan for [MHV portal, Supply reordering tool, 2025-02]
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
Veterans often need to quickly take actions, such as ordering medications or scheduling appointments through the MHV on VA.gov. Currently, the lack of guidance around tasks in the design system leads teams to develop their own approaches or rely on form templates, resulting in inconsistencies across the website and making it harder for Veterans to complete tasks efficiently. The teams can't fully rely on forms because they are used as a tool to collect information or facilitate processes related to tasks. By implementing the multistep task pattern for tasks on VA.gov, we can create a more straightforward experience that enables Veterans to easily and quickly complete their routine actions by dividing them into short, intuitive and manageable steps.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the following OCTO priorities: 
1. Objective 1, Key Result 1: Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products. 
2. Objective 1, Key Result 2: Reduce the total time Veterans spend waiting for a response from our digital experiences. 

### Veteran Journey
The new pattern fits into the following stages of the Veteran journey: starting up, taking care of myself, putting down roots, retiring, aging. 

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to compare the old (form pattern, version A) and new (task pattern, version B) versions of the medical supplies tool. Specifically, we want to understand:  
1. If the multistep task pattern will make completing routine and simple tasks faster and easier for Veterans. 
2. Veterans’ expectations when completing routine tasks. 

### Outcome
This research will validate the usefulness of the pattern for routine tasks and indicate that routine tasks need a pattern other than form for a simpler task completion experience.    

### Research questions
1. Which pattern option enables Veterans to complete reordering medical supplies more quickly?  
2. Which pattern option do Veterans find to be more intuitive and less difficult to use? 
3. Which pattern option increases satisfactions amongst Veterans in the digital patient portal experience? 
4. Which pattern option builds greater trust in the VA with Veterans? 
5. What are Veterans’ expectations when completing routine tasks?  

### Hypothesis
1. The average time to complete tasks will be lower on the new pattern. 
2. The task success rate will be greater on the new pattern. 
3. A higher proportion of Veterans will find the new pattern to be more intuitive and satisfying than the old experience. 
4. The old pattern will produce higher rates of distrust in VA digital services than the new pattern. 
5. Veterans expect to complete routine tasks quickly and in one session, rather than expecting to leave and come back to the task.  
6. Veterans who are used to fill out forms on VA.gov may find the new pattern surprising and too short. 

## Methodology	
Unmoderated A/B prototype testing using Optimal Workshop's prototype testing feature. We will publish 2 tests: one with version A (form pattern) and one with version B (multistep task pattern). Both tests will ask the same questions, but will have different prototypes. We will use SPSS or R studio for analysis.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information in an encrypted Excel sheet saved on the VA network Sharepoint drive.  

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions

Feb 28 – Close test 

### Length of sessions
