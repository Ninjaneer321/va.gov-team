# Research Plan for [Medications and Devices Pod, Medical Supplies Reorder, 26 March 2024]

## Background

In previous studies, there is an indication that Veterans think there's a connection between medical supplies and medications. As our team moves the medical supplies reordering functionality to MHV on VA.gov, we need to understand where Veterans expect to find medical supplies on the auth MHV home page, and how similar or different Veterans think about medications and medical supplies. 

### OCTO Priorities 

- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
	- Key Result 1: The number of transactions processed using our products has increased by 25%.
 	- Key Result 2: All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.

### Veteran Journey

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	

The purpose of this study is to: 

- Understand how Veterans categorize medications and medical supplies.
- Understand whether Veterans expect to view all medical supplies and medications in the same list or separately and whether Veterans expect to order all medical supplies and medications together or separately.
- Establish which design and I.A. is easier to use, or the advantages and disadvantages of each design option.


### Outcome

This research will inform the Cartography team on how to display medical supplies on the MHV on VA.gov and inform our team on the designs and I.A. of medical supplies whenever the supply ordering functionality is ready to integrate with MHV on VA.gov. 

### Research questions

- Which of the options is the most effective? In which is the user better able to order a supply? 
  	- Do Veterans expect medical supplies and medications to be completely different tools on MHV on VA.gov (design option 1), OR do they expect them to be in the same category of tools with different characteristics (design option 2), OR do they expect them to be the same (design option 3), OR something else?
  	- How do Veterans expect to view and order their supplies; together or separate from a list of their medications?
- What are the main stumbling blocks for Veterans?
- What are the best and worst features of each option? 

### Hypothesis

- Veterans may think medical supplies and medications are in the same category because they both need to be prescribed.
- Veterans may have difficulties finding and ordering medical supplies if they are on the same list as medications.
- Veterans may expect medical supplies and medications to be in the same category on MHV home but expect to view and order them separately.
- Veterans may be confused about how to categorize supplies like testing strips and wound care supplies, for the design option that has medical supplies and medications in different sections (MHV home) and different lists. 

## Methodology	

This will be a mix of research methodologies, including concept test, moderated user interviews, and exploratory/comparison test. We will conduct remote sessions on Zoom. Interview sessions will consist of tasks and direct questions regarding participants' behaviors, thoughts, and reactions. We will conduct the study with Figma prototypes. 

### Location

All sessions will be remote on Zoom.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
