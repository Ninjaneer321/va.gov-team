# Research Plan for [Medications and Devices Pod, Medical Supplies Reorder, 26 March 2024]

## Background

In previous studies, there is an indication that Veterans think there's a connection between medical supplies and medications. As our team moves the medical supplies reordering functionality to MHV on VA.gov, we need to understand where Veterans expect to find medical supplies on the auth MHV home page, and how similar or different Veterans think about medications and medical supplies. 

### OCTO Priorities 

- Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.
	- Key Result 1: The number of transactions processed using our products has increased by 25%.
 	- Key Result 2: All new products have a faster transaction time than those they replaced.

### Veteran Journey

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	

The purpose of this study is to: 

- Understand how Veterans categorize medications and medical supplies.
- Understand whether Veterans expect to view all medical supplies and medications in the same list or separately and whether Veterans expect to order all medical supplies and medications together or separately.
- Establish which design and I.A. is easier to use, or the advantages and disadvantages of each design option.


### Outcome

This research will inform the Cartography team on how to display medical supplies on the MHV on VA.gov and inform our team on the designs and I.A. of medical supplies whenever the supply ordering functionality is ready to integrate with MHV on VA.gov. 

### Research questions

- Which of the options is the most effective? In which is the user better able to order a supply? 
  	- Do Veterans expect medical supplies and medications to be completely different tools on MHV on VA.gov (design option 1), OR do they expect them to be in the same category of tools with different characteristics (design option 2), OR do they expect them to be the same (design option 3), OR something else?
  	- How do Veterans expect to view and order their supplies; together or separate from a list of their medications?
- What are the main stumbling blocks for Veterans?
- What are the best and worst features of each option? 

### Hypothesis

- Veterans may think medical supplies and medications are in the same category because they both need to be prescribed.
- Veterans may have difficulties finding and ordering medical supplies if they are on the same list as medications.
- Veterans may expect medical supplies and medications to be in the same category on MHV home but expect to view and order them separately.
- Veterans may be confused about how to categorize supplies like testing strips and wound care supplies, for the design option that has medical supplies and medications in different sections (MHV home) and different lists. 

## Methodology	

This will be a mix of research methodologies, including concept test, moderated user interviews, and exploratory/comparison test. We will conduct remote sessions on Zoom. Interview sessions will consist of tasks and direct questions regarding participants' behaviors, thoughts, and reactions. We will conduct the study with Figma prototypes. 

### Location

All sessions will be remote on Zoom.
