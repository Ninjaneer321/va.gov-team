# July 1 - 31, 2024 CX Metrics Report Summary 

This is an analysis of Veteran feedback from Medallia on medical supplies reordering experience for **July 1 - July 31, 2024**. The sources of Veteran feedback are from A11 Satisfaction (intercept) Survey and Veterans Facing Serivces (VFS) Feedback (always on) Survey. On top of the CX metrics, we'll also be monitoring medical supplies reordering form usage through Google analytics (GA4). 

## Quantative data (July)

#### A11 Satisfaction Survey & VFS Feedback Survey 

Overall, the satisfaction scores from A11 Survey didn't fluctuate much compare to the previous months. The volume of responses is increasing and higher than June, which is great and means more people are finding the supply reordering form.

## Qualitative data (July 17-31)

#### Comments Sentiment Analysis 

The percentage of positive and negative comments in the last 2 weeks of July is very similar to the beginning of July with an increase in people who provided comments. We're actively taking in account the negative comments and making sure they are addressed in the form iterations.

![july7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5886d7ff-fafa-4c1c-8021-1aaa5e927221)

There's an increase in volumn for a couple of error patterns and one new error, however; we should take into account of an increase of 59 in total comments compare to the last report. We also added a new code, feature request, which means Veterans commented additional needs that the current tool doesn't fulfill. Please see the noteworthy comments on error patterns and feature requests below:
