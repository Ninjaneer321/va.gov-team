# July 1 - 31, 2024 CX Metrics Report Summary 

This is an analysis of Veteran feedback from Medallia on medical supplies reordering experience for **July 1 - July 31, 2024**. The sources of Veteran feedback are from A11 Satisfaction (intercept) Survey and Veterans Facing Serivces (VFS) Feedback (always on) Survey. On top of the CX metrics, we'll also be monitoring medical supplies reordering form usage through Google analytics (GA4). 

## Quantative data (July)

### A11 Satisfaction Survey & VFS Feedback Survey 

Overall, the satisfaction scores from A11 Survey didn't fluctuate much compare to the previous months. The volume of responses is increasing and higher than June, which is great and means more people are finding the supply reordering form.

## Qualitative data (July 17-31)

### Comments Sentiment Analysis 

The percentage of positive and negative comments in the last 2 weeks of July is very similar to the beginning of July with an increase in people who provided comments. We're actively taking in account the negative comments and making sure they are addressed in the form iterations.

### Usability errors pattern (based on comments)

![july7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5886d7ff-fafa-4c1c-8021-1aaa5e927221)

There's an increase in volumn for a couple of error patterns and one new error, however; we should take into account of an increase of 59 in total comments compare to the last report. We also added a new code, feature request, which means Veterans commented additional needs that the current tool doesn't fulfill. Please see the noteworthy comments on error patterns and feature requests below:

### Comments from Veterans 

⋅**Uable to proceed to next page (42)**
> Can not order CPAP supplies. Site stuck on info page of address and email even though filled out properly.<br>
*- URL:Path - /health-care/order-hearing-aid-or-CPAP-supplies-form/address*

> Clicked on "CONTINUE" button on page 1 of 3 and it doesn't go to the next page. Says "Order has been saved". I don't know what the order was for since I didn't get to pick anaything! How can I verify the order?<br>
*- URL:Path - /health-care/order-hearing-aid-or-CPAP-supplies-form/address*

⋅**Uable to order supplies due to invalid date rules (24)**
> Says I can't order because it hasn't been 5 months. Odd? I haven't ecer ordered online, and I haven't ordered any CPAP supplies for well over a year.<br>
*- URL:Path - /health-care/order-hearing-aid-or-CPAP-supplies-form/introduction?postLogin=true?postLogin=true*

> Site keeps telling me it's too soon to order. I haven't ordered in almost a year! Wondering what's the problem?<br>
*- URL:Path - /health-care/order-hearing-aid-or-CPAP-supplies-form/introduction*

> The error message says that I can't reorder until July 26, 2024, well today is July 26, 2024. I frequently run out of filters before I can order new ones and have had to purchase them separately twice in the last year.<br>
*- URL:Path - /health-care/order-hearing-aid-or-CPAP-supplies-form/introduction*

⋅**Temporary address issue (10)**
> Why did the system require a temporary address when all I needed to do was sent it to my permanent address?<br>
*- URL:Path - /health-care/order-hearing-aid-or-CPAP-supplies-form/confirmation*

> Two problems 1) When I select Home address for shipping, it still required me to enter a temporary address before continuing so I had to enter home address as temporary address. 2) The items are somewhat coded so I am not sure what I ordered. There needs to be a clear description of each item, not just an item number. Since I am not sure I ordered what I wanted, I simply selected all of them. Poor information on your part.<br>
*- URL:Path - /health-care/order-hearing-aid-or-CPAP-supplies-form/address*

⋅**No records, or no updated supplies (10)**
> Trying to order wax traps for my hearing aids.  Told  my records can not be found.  Why?  I've ordered them before with no problems.<br>
*- URL:Path - /health-care/order-hearing-aid-or-CPAP-supplies-form/introduction*

> I'm trying to get my CPAP machine updated in the VA system so I can get the correct supplies for my machine.  However, I'm constantly having to log in and when I do, the system CANNOT find my information.  Very disappointed that I cannot get this updated.<br>

**_Feature request (11)_**
- I wanted to update the quantity on the items but I was unable to. It looks like it only allowed me to order what was previously ordered by the VA.
- Would be nice if there were pictures of each item.
- The website wouldn't let me place an order because I have placed an order within the last 5 months. Why on earth would you limit the number of times someone can place an online order. Now I have to either call or send an order via traditional mail, which is only slower and less efficient. It's like you're opting for reduced efficiency.
- Helpful to get email notifications.
- Illustrations of available accessories would be helpful. Also, ability to order a different size and style would also be helpful.
