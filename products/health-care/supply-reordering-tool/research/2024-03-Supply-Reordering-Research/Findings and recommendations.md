## Research Goals
The medical supply reordering tool on VA.gov provides a more convenient way for Veterans to order their medical supplies from DLC online instead of ordering through call, mail, email, and messages on MHV. It's new on VA.gov. Veterans can access the tool on VA.gov from the main menu and on the MHV home page once they sign in. Currently, they can reorder hearing aid batteries and accessories, CPAP supplies, and prosthetic socks. Before adding more supplies to the tool, our team wants to pause and evaluate how the tool is performing so that we are prepared and confident to make more supplies available for Veterans to reorder, which will also reduce the use of DLC's contact centers. 

The purpose of this research was to:
- Better understand how Veterans currently order and re-order medical supplies.
- Evaluate if the current digital form on VA.gov is user-friendly and easy to understand for Veterans. 

## Research Questions
- What are Veterans' reactions to and understanding of the current digital medical supplies ordering tool?
	- Is it clear that the form may include hearing aid supplies and CPAP supplies?
	- Is it clear to users why some supplies are available and some are not?
	- Is the form clear on what Veterans need to do when supplies are unavailable?
	- Do Veterans know what to do when they want to change supplies after submission?
   	- Can Veterans complete the reorder process?
- How are Veterans notified when their prescribed medical supplies are eligible to reorder?
   	- How is the process of reordering indicated to Veterans first time and subsequent times? 

## Methodology 
We will conduct remote usability and interview sessions on Zoom. The interviews will consist of one task and direct questions. We will conduct the study in the [staging environment](https://staging.va.gov/](https://staging.va.gov/health-care/order-hearing-aid-batteries-and-accessories/), with one test account and a different password created specifically for the study. We will document each password created in the [sensitive repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/pharmacy/medical%20supplies-staging%20passwords.md).

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Participants will get through the ordering the supplies task relatively easily.
	- Maybe True: 9 out of 9 participants finished the reorder task. There was some wonkiness on the verify address step, but everyone was able to figure it out with little to no assistance. 
2. Participants may not know how to change supplies once orders are submitted.
	- Likely False: Everyone knew to contact their health team or doctor if they needed help with their supplies.
3. Participants probably look to see what shape their supplies are in to know when to reorder and/or are notified by their clinician.
   	- Likely True: All participants mentioned that they keep written notes, mental notes, or check their inventories of supplies to know when to reorder.
4. Participants probably find out about the reordering process from their VA provider.
   	- Maybe True: Some mentioned their provider places an order when they visit for an appointment, and some mentioned that they know about mailing the order from the paper form they receive in the mail. 
5. Most Participants would probably call DLC or try to call their VA Medical Center to discuss changing supplies, for example, if they want a different-sized CPAP supply after submitting a supply order.
   	- Maybe true: Most participants know who they need to contact for changing supplies, and most of them had good and easy experiences with that. 

## Key Findings

1. All participants mentioned having notes, doing mental checks, or checking inventories to track when they need to reorder supplies.
2. **Starting page:** Most participants (6 out of 9) clicked on the Order link quickly without reading other information on the page. 
3. **Instruction page with sign-in button:** Most participants (7 out of 9) skipped instructions and wanted to sign in right away.
5.  **Step 1 Verify personal information and address:** Even though no one was confused about the meaning of permanent address and temporary address, some participants showed hesitation in the instructions for "Edit permanent address" when they (7 out of 9) expected permanent address to be accurate and filled in. 
6.  **Step 2 Select supplies:** All participants found it easy to select supplies. 5 out of 9 participants expected to see only what they need to reorder.
7.  **Step 2 Review:** All participants were able to review by clicking on the expand component. When instructed to leave the form and come back later, 2 participants missed the "finish this later" link and weren't sure how to save it. 
8.  **Step 3 Confirmation:** All participants are satisfied with the information on the confirmation page, and 3 mentioned they liked the print option.
9.  All participants are able to finish the order of a hearing aid task, and most participants (7 out of 9) gave a score of 4 and 5 for overall use experience (5 being the easiest). 


## Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible. Please **add relevant keywords/labels to your findings** selected from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc). Adding keywords/labels to your findings will help others find research relevant to their work._


**Finding 1: All participants mentioned having notes, doing mental checks, or checking inventories to track when they need to reorder supplies.**

9 out of 9 participants use written notes, have mental checks, or check inventories to track their supplies to know when it's time to reorder. Even though no one expresses strong dissatisfaction that  There are currently no notifications or other user-friendly ways to remind Veterans that it's time to submit reorders.
