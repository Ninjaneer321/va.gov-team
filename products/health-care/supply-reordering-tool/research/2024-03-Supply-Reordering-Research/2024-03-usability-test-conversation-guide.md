## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?

My name is [name]. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving the VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If, for any reason and at any time, you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- We will, for the most part today, be talking through some of your experiences with medical supplies. At some point, I will have you complete a task on VA.gov with a test account, which I will walk you through how.  Please keep in mind that the testing website is only a demo tool, it may look familiar but would not act like you expect it to. I will guide you on the part that's functional.

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will take notes to ensure we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_[If yes:]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_[If no:] I_ appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

_[If yes:] Thank_ you! We very much appreciate you talking with us today.

_[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves]_

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- _[If yes: ]_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_[Start recording.]_

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

### **Participant Coaching**

Today we are just trying to hear and learn from you about your experience using the medical supplies ordering tool on VA.gov website. I will be asking you some questions and at some point, I will have you complete a task. Part of understanding how we can best improve this website is to understand what's working for our Veterans and what's not. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Your feedback today will help us make sure that we meet your needs and expectations on the website. Does that make sense?

Are you ready to dive in?

## **Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

Let's get started. According to my notes, you have been prescribed medical supplies in the past few years. 

- Can you tell me a bit about what supply you use and your last experience reordering supplies?
- How was that experience?
- How did you find out about how to reorder supplies?
- What notifications do you receive about reordering?
- How do you know when to place an order?
- _If they have ordered on VA.gov before_ Ask how and what was the experience like for them.
- _If they have ordered on physical forms only_ Ask if they are aware of the digital form on VA.gov.

Great, that’ll be helpful to know as we move forward. 

Thank you for sharing all that with me! 


**Let’s start screen sharing so you can show me how you’d do that. Are you familiar with how to share your screen with Zoom?** 

Screen sharing instructions:

In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 

If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again. 

(If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared) 

Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser. 

Great, now I can see your screen! 

Thank you for your patience in figuring this out. Now let's go to that website. I can post the URL in the chat or just say it to you. Which of you prefer? 

_Send them or say: https://staging.va.gov/health-care/order-hearing-aid-batteries-and-accessories/ 

This is a test version of VA.gov. It looks like the real website and we have turned some special features on for our session. Nothing we do here will impact your information and you will see it has test data (like a made-up name) in certain parts of the site. 


## Task 1 : Can you walk me through how you would order a hearing aid supply? - 20 minutes 

#### _Now at Order content landing page_

If participant mentions or attempts to sign in send credentials 

If participant does not attempt to sign in, let them explore a bit 

If you signed in, do you think anything different would be available? 

If participant mentions or attempts to sign in, send credentials 


Please think out loud and let me know what your thoughts are about the page, the information here, and how everything is organized. 

Where would you go next? 

Participant clicks quicklink 

Now that we are at this page, can you show me what you would do next to make a supply order? 

Participant clicks quicklink 

#### _Step 1 Page : Veteran Information_

You have now arrived at the first step of the order form. Please think out loud and let me know what your thoughts are about the page, the information here, and how everything is organized. 

Anything confusing?  

Would you add, remove, or change anything on this page?  

Any additional questions on this page? 

#### _Step 1 Page (cont). : Veteran Information_

What do you think about this page? Can you please show us how you would complete this step of the form? 

Before you hit continue, how would you describe the difference between a permanent address and a temporary address? When would you sue one over the other?  

#### _Step 1 Page (cont). : Veteran Information_ 

Observe if there's any confusion for this page and what they need to do. Ask if they seem stuck or quiet. 

Let’s see if you’re at a different location from your home, how would you add your current location and make sure the supplies ship to your current location?  


#### _Step 2 : Select your supplies_

Can you show me how you would order a hearing aid supply from this page? Please think out loud about this page and let me know your thoughts. 

Once participant has selected supply 

Before you hit continue, is there any other information that would have been helpful to identify or select the correct supply? 

Would you add, remove, or change any details about each supply to this screen?  

Scale of 1 to 5, how easy or difficult was it to select the supplies that you need to reorder?  

Point to CPAP supplies being not available:  

What if this supply is what you needed, what would you do next?  

#### _Step 3: Review order details_

Can you show us how you would submit your order? 

At this point, you realized that you forgot to add X supply to this order, how would you go about adding that to this order?  

Let’s say that at this point in your order, you realize that you need to ask a question to your VA provider before placing the order, and you need to save this order and come back later to submit. Could you show me how you would save this order, then resubmit it?  

#### _Step 4: Confirmation screen_

So at this point in the order, you would see a confirmation screen. Here is what that looks like : (share screen of screenshot and/or prototype screen) 

Can you share any reactions and thoughts you have for this? 

Is there anything confusing or if you have any questions on this page?  

Can you tell me what you ordered here? Would you like to add anything to this page?

#### _Overall_

How would you rate this reordering overall experience from 1 to 5, 5 being the easiest? 

If you could change one thing about this supply reordering experience, what would it be? 

 

## Closing - 10 minutes 

Thank you for doing that task, we gained some insight into how Veterans may go through this form. As we wind down, I hope you don't mind if we ask a couple more questions about supply ordering. 

How would you go about changing your supply type or brand? 

If a supply isn't available and you are told to talk to your provider, then how would you do that? 

In your experience/opinion, are we missing any devices? 

Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you’d like to share? Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up? 

## Thank You

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
