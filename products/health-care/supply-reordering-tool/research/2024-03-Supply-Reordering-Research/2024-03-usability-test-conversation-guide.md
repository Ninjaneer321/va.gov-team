## Intro - 5- minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jonathan and [NOTETAKER NAME] is on the call who will be taking notes.

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double check with you before we get going. 

**Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth


Today we're going to take a look at (explore) the VA.gov website and ask you some questions. We’re interested in learning from you what it’s like to navigate and find information on the website.
  
**For screenreader or mobile sessions:** Before we start, I want to confirm a few pieces of information that were shared with me when you signed up for the study:

- **For screenreader sessions:** I understand you use screenreader software to navigate the internet, and that you typically use SOFTWARE NAME.  Are you able to use that during our session today?
- That sounds good, thank you.

- **For mobile sessions:** I understand you use your smartphone primarily to access VA.gov. Can you confirm that you are on your phone now? 

Thank you for confirming these things! Now, I have a few things about today I want to go over with you before we get started. 

- **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know. 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **I’m also going to make sure transcriptions are turned on to improve our notes.**

_Turn on transcription._

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 10 minutes

Let's get started. According to my notes, you have ordered medical supplies in the past few years

Can you tell me a bit about what supply you use and your last experience reordering supplies?

Great, that’ll be helpful to know as we move forward.

How did you found out about how to reorder supplies?

Thank you for sharing all that with me!

We have a specific tool here at VA for ordering supplies, and we want to see how you would navigate getting through an order.

Let’s start screen sharing so you can show me how you’d do that. Are you familiar with how to share your screen with Zoom? 


#### Screen sharing instructions

_Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:_
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

_Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:_
- Hit Alt S (as in Same); the option should come up to select the window you want to share - please choose Basic. 
- Tab over and confirm that what is selected is "entire screen." 
- Tab once more - make sure "share sound" is checked. 
- Tab 4 times over to "share screen" - click activate. 

Great, now I can see your screen! 

Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.  Now let's go to that website. I can post the URL in the chat or just say it to you. Which of you prefer? 

- _Send them or say staging.va.gov_In your browser please enter "staging.va.gov"

- This is a test version of VA.gov. It looks like the real website and we have turned some special features on for our session. Nothing we do here will impact your actually information and you will see it has test data (like a made up name) in certain parts of the site. 
  
- So, Please go ahead and show me how you’d find where to order CPAP supplies on this website.

_If participant mentions or attempts to sign in_ send credentials   

_If participant does not attempt to sign in_Let them explore a bit_
- If you signed in, do you think anything different would be available?
  
_Guide participant to CPAP page, either to health hub or main navigation,or search, or to sign in 
   - _If participant mentions or attempts to sign in_ send credentials
   - _If participant struggles to find quicklink_, nudge them in the right direction and send credentials when relevant 

- Great, I’d like for you to continue show me how to find this information from this page (VA.gov)?

  _Once the participant arrives at the CPAP content page_

Please think out loud and let me know what your thoughts are about the page, the information here, and how everything is organized. 
- Is this information useful to you?

  Where would you go next if you want to Order supplies online?

### Things to watch for:

## Task 1 : Go through order form - 20 minutes

_Now at Order form page_

Can you again think out loud and let me know your thoughts about the page, the information here, and how everything is organized?

- Is this information useful to you?

  Where would you go next to make a supply order?

_Participant clicks quicklink_

Are you expecting to order hearing aid supplies or CPAP supplies? Does this make sense to you? What do you think this page is for?

 Please think out loud and let me know what your thoughts are about the page, the information here, and how everything is organized. 

 Now that we are at this page, can you show me what you would do next to make a supply order?

 _Step 1 Page : Veteran Information_ 

You have now arrived at the first step of the order form.  Please think out loud and let me know what your thoughts are about the page, the information here, and how everything is organized. 

Is the information listed here useful for you to see? 

_Step 1 Page (cont). : Veteran Information_

What do you think about this page? Can you please show us how you would complete this step of the form?

Before you hit continue, are the different types of addresses on this page clear? Do you understand how you would change your address if needed?

_Step 1 Page (cont). : Veteran Information_

Is it clear what to do on this page?

_Step 2 : Select your supplies_

Can you show me how you would order a CPAP supply from this page? Please think out loud about this page and let me know your thoughts.

_Once participant has selected supply_

Before you hit continue, is there any other information that would have been helpful to identify or select the correct supply?


_Step 3: Review order details_

Can you show us how you would submit your order?

_Step 4: Confirmation screen_

So at this point in the order you would see a confirmation screen. Here is what that looks like : (share screen of screenshot and/or prototype screen)

Can you share any reactions and thoughts you have for this?


### Task #2 : Interview - 10 minutes 

Thank you for doing that task, we definitely gained some insight into how Veterans may go through this form. As we wind down, I hope you don't mind if we ask a couple more questions about supply ordering.

- How would you go about changing your supply type or brand?
-  If a supply isn't available and you are told to talk to your provider, then how would you do that?
- In your experience/opinion, are we missing any devices?

Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you’d like to share?
Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?


## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
