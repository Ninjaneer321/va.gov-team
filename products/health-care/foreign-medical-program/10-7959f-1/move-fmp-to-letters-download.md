# Product Outline: Removing the 10-7959f-1 application in favor of downloading FMP benefits authorization letter.

---

## Overview
The 10-7959f-1 registration for foreign medical program form is for Veterans living overseas to be able to register their foreign status with the VA. 

## Problem Statement
The paper form was brought onto the VA.gov platform on Oct 2024 with 80% of all registrations originating from the VA.gov platform.  While this is a great transition from paper forms, the registration process does still put an added burden of providing information to the VA that can easily be obtained from other systems.  Our research also indicates that the the primary purpose of registering by the Veteran is to obtain an FMP benefits authorization letter that can be shown to foreign providers as an assurance the the VA will reimburse those providers for the conditions listed on the letter.  Even with the online registration process, the Veteran has to wait for days or weeks to obtain the letter. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans are able to fill out the registration form online on VA.gov
- Veterans spend less time, effort and money filling out and mailing paperwork
- Veterans spend less time spent waiting to hear back on their application status 

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans are unaware that they can apply online
- Veterans encounter errors during the online application process 
- Veterans have low confidence in the online process or have concerns around online security
- The response burden is increased for the user

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Reduce the volume of paperwork being processed that comes in through mail and fax
- Reduce the time and effort spent processing paper forms
- Reduce the amount of resubmissions due to missing information or documents

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- The information entered online by Veterans is not successfully submitted to the VA
- Online forms processing adds confusion and complicates workflows further
