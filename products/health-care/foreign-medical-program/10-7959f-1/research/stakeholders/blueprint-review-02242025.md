# FMP Application Service Blueprint Meeting 

2/26/25

Attendees: Andrea Merrill, Andrea Bingham, Andrew Szymczak, Arleen Schoentag, Jennifer Rivera, Leticia Diaz, Premal Shah, Rachel Pope, Renata Keck, Richard McKeithan

- ## Discover information
  - Not sure if VSO ever sends in for veteran, but would not be a problem if they did. Would be processed the same

- ## Application request
  - There is only the registration form, not a packet of material
  - Requests come in through the same methods listed in the outreach section
  - Generally mailed out
  - If request comes through AVA, form would be emailed to veteran
  - Timeline for mail is probably accurate for domestic mail, but overseas can take weeks


- ## Completed form 
  - CIPM handles mail receipt, not DCDM
    - May route to DCDM for research if CIPM cannot categorize the form
  - CIPM scans form and uploads into PEGA
  - Forms show up in PEGA queue - can identify by code where each form comes from (VA, PG, FX, CPM)
  - Currently less than 30 days for processing time (about 2 weeks)
    - Online form states 45 days, so they try to process online forms within that time frame
    - Work queue from oldest to newest
  - CIPM files have not shown up recently - may lead to a backlog or delay once they are in the queue


- ## Form not submitted
  - Have had instances where the veteran has a confirmation number, but it doesn’t relate to anything in their system so they can’t match it to the registration


- ## Eligibility
  - DAPER is no longer used - remove from blueprint
  - Only VBMS and VIS are used for lookup
    - VBMS has the most up-to-date demographic information for the veteran
    - VIS is used for service-related conditions - easier to read format
  - VBMS  will be the system of record for VES

- ## If there is no record for the applicant
  - Create FMP account with social and send denial letter
  - If obviously a child (DOB), no FMP account created
    - Note in PEGA
    - Route to DCDM for denial letter
