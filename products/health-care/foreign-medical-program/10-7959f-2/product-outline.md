# Product Outline - 10-7959f-2 Claim Cover Sheet

---

## Overview
The online [10-7959f-2](https://www.va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/) would allow Veterans to file a claim to get coverage for a service connected condition while outside of the U.S.

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

How might we make it easier for Veterans in the Foreign Medical Program to file claims?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans are able to easily fill out the claim cover sheet  online on VA.gov
- Veterans spend less time, effort and money filling out and mailing paperwork

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans are unaware that they can fill out form online
- Veterans encounter errors during the online process
- Veterans have low confidence in the online process

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Volume of paperwork being processed is reduced
- Veterans' information is processed in a timely manner
- Amount of resubmissions due to missing information or documents is reduced

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Errors during online submission process
- Increased delays during processing

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._
* Takes 120 days to process (this is outside desired goal - 90% within 45 days).
* Can take 'minutes to hours' to process a claim (depending on how many pages).
