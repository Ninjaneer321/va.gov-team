If the Veteran can’t cash that their reimbursement check in the country where they’re located, are there resources to help them figure out how to cash it?
For the purposes of this form, is the mailing address or physical address more important?
Is the mailing address always for the Veteran, or can it sometimes be for the provider (e.g., if the provider is the one being paid)?
What are the most common reasons a claim might be rejected?
What, if anything, is most commonly missing from a claims form that you need to process it?
What are the most common reasons for an escalation?
Can they provide multiple claims under the same cover sheet or do they have to do a new cover sheet every time?
What kind of confirmation do folks get that their claim is being covered - just the check? Do they get a processing notification?
Can you provide us with a walkthrough of processing a claim/handling an escalation? It would be especially helpful if you can share your screen and do one live, if that’s relevant.
