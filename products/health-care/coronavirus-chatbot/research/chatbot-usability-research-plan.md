# Research Plan for COVID-19 Chatbot Usability Testing
**4/14/2020**

This document outlines a research plan for testing the usability of the COVID-19 chatbot.
## Goals
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase of Veterans and care teams seeking information from the VA about COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, testing, quarantine, prevention, and other topics. Based on previous research, we have validated a click-through decision tree chatbot is an appropriate method of delivering COVID-19 information. The goals of this research will focus on the usability of the chatbot and include:
- Validate the content the chatbot provides is relevant, helpful, and categorized as expected.
- Validate users are able to successfully interact with the chatbot to find desired information.
- Identify usability shortcomings and potential improvements for interacting with the chatbot.

## Method
We will conduct remote testing using a development version of the chatbot over Zoom.

## Participants and Recruitment
We are seeking 5-7 participants and will work with Perigean to recruit participants.
Criteria:
- Veterans or those who care for a Veteran
- Mix of genders
- Mix of ages
- Bonus if the participant has sought information (online or over phone) from VA about COVID-19.

## When?
Sessions are expected to run 30 minutes
**Availability:**   
Thursday, April 16, 8AM - 1PM ET  
Friday, April 17, 8AM - 3PM ET  
Monday, April 20, 8AM - 6PM ET  
Tuesday, April 21, 8AM - 10AM ET, 12PM - 6PM ET  
Wednesday, April 22, 8AM - 1PM ET  
Thursday, April 23, 12PM - 3:30PM ET
