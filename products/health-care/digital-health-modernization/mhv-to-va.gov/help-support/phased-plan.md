# Phased plan for help & support on My HealtheVet

## Background and problem statement
The My HealtheVet to VA.gov migration will occur across a series of planned phases, which incrementally send more and more users to VA.gov. Alongside this migration effort, the My HealtheVet helpdesk will also continue to support the health portal and its users, but surfacing this helpdesk and its adjacent phone numbers and/or other support tools on MyHealtheVet pages has not yet been addressed. 

The cartography team identified this risk in Fall 2023 and began prioritizing this work in Sprint 27 (April 1, 2024). Our initial goals are to build on earlier discovery work and identify solution(s) that can begin to aid users in getting help when and where they need it, in the clearest way posible. We will try to launch a low-risk MVP solution first, and move toward research to validate moer complex concepts with Veterans before moving forward with those ideas.
