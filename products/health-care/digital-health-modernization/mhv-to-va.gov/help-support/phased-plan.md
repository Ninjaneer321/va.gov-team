# Phased plan for help & support on My HealtheVet

## Background and problem statement
The My HealtheVet to VA.gov migration will occur across a series of planned phases, which incrementally send more and more users to VA.gov. Alongside this migration effort, the My HealtheVet helpdesk will also continue to support the health portal and its users, but surfacing this helpdesk and its adjacent phone numbers and/or other support tools on MyHealtheVet pages has not yet been addressed. 

We believe My HealtheVet users will struggle to find the "right" phone number on VA.gov, where the landscape is complex. We can no longer simply put a simple My HealtheVet phone number in the footer of the website.  Veterans expect to find fast, accurate help "in context" with where they encounter a problem. For the health portal, this might mean the landing page, or more deeply on tool pages. The problem of identifying the "right" help or phone number will be exacerbated when Cerner/Oracle Health is integrated, which will introduce additional phone numbers and another helpdesk, meaning we will need to iterate on any solution at that point. We believe the sooner we can start iterating on a solution and learning about Veteran needs and expectations for help around the health portal, the better suited we will be to handle this in later phases, at and beyond the Cerner integration work.

The cartography team identified this risk in Fall 2023 and began prioritizing this work in Sprint 27 (April 1, 2024). Our initial goals are to build on earlier discovery work and identify solution(s) that can begin to aid users in getting help when and where they need it, in the clearest way possible. We will aim to launch a low-risk MVP solution first, and move toward research to validate more complex concepts with Veterans before moving forward with those ideas. 

## Current help and support landscape

**What types of questions does the MHV Call Center answer today?** 
* =HealtheVet helpdesk call center data comes in through VSignals, with about 30,000 datapoints per month. Kophie Mathis is solely responsible for combing through this data, and he reports out trends in the My HealtheVet Feedback dashboard.
* So far, we know that the largest clusters of calls come in about:
  * Secure Messages
  * Sign-in and account access related issues
 
**What topics did My HealtheVet National Portal cover that will no longer be coverered on VA.gov?**
* Patient-entered data
* Health tracking devices
* Blog post content (unknown)

**What topics are new, that My HealtheVet on VA.gov will need to be able to cover?**
* Medical supplies and devices (hearing aid battery and CPAP supply re-order)
* 10-10EZR
* Payments and medical co-pays
* Travel reimbursement (BTSSS)
* ID.me and/or Login.gov questions
* Potentially be prepared to transfer users to other helpdesks for non-health related questions

**What help tools do we have on VA.gov today, and can we leverage those to support My HealtheVet users?**
