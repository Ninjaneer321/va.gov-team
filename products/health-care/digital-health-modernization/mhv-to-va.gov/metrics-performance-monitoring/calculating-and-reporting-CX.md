# Calculating and Reporting Customer Experience (CX) Metrics on MHV on VA.gov

## Sources of CX data

Descriptions of the A11 survey and VFS Questionnaire can be found [here](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/analytics-monitoring/how-to-use-medallia-data-in-domo). Things to know about these surveys: 

1. A11 survey = intercept survey; randomly pops up for 5% of VA.gov users who have had a 20-second or more extended session. Questions from from A11 OMB Circular and adhere to broader federal guidelines on measuring customer satisfaction. Will be replaced in patient portal by a 15-item survey that combines current A11 questions with MHV Classic CSAT questions in August/ Sept. 2024.
2. VFS Questionnaire = questions that pop up when Veteran clicks on blue feedback button. Also refered to as Feedback Survey. Respondents self select and therefore data must be engaged with differently as the sample is not random.

## How to analyze quantitative data

All questions with 5-pt Likert response options should be analyzed in the following way: 
- 4s and 5s = "positive"
- 1s and 2s = "negative"
- 3s = neutral
- Proportion of "positive" responses = CX score. For example, if 100 Veterans responded with a 4 or 5 in response to a CX question, then the CX score for that question is 60/100 = 60%.

## Reporting quantitative CX data

- CX data from A11 intercept survey is most valuable for reporting purposes.
- When reporting, always include the sample size and the name of the survey from which a question came.
- The [Medallia Domo Report](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/825663825) is a better resource than the [CSAT dashboard](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1545882322) as scores are calculated as an average rather than a proportion of positive or negative in the CSAT dashboard.
