### ROI work
Notes
- SM is the preferred way to request records 

Questions
- Are all patients by default associated with an ROI triage group?
- What happens if associated with multiple facilities? Do they get multiple ROI triage group options?
- Confirm: Do they need to send the form? Or can they simply sign the electronic signature?
- Can they submit a request for partial records?
- What if anything can we communicate to users about what to expect after they send off that message? Will they get a response in SM? Will they get a response via email/mail? 

Action items (AIs) 
- [ ] Robyn will kick off questions to Sylvia and Tracey, will cc' Jonathan, Tori, Marci, Becky.
