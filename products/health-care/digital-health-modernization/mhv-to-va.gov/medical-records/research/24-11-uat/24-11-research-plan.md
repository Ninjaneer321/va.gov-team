# Research Plan for Medical Records team, December 2024

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) is being moved to VA.gov. MHV provides Veterans with the ability to review their medical records, including labs and tests, online. 

As part of this effort, we need to confirm that the test data that Veterans who receive care in multiple facilities is being accurately exposed on VA.gov. 

You can read more about the Digital Health Modernization strategy [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product).

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
The purpose of this UAT is to confirm that medical records data is showing up as intended for Veterans who receive care in multiple facilities. 

### Outcome
This research will validate that medical record data are accurately represented.  

### Research questions

1. For Veterans who receive care in multiple VistA facilities, are they able to see data from both facilities for the following domains:
- Vaccines
- Health conditions
- Allergies
- Labs
- Notes
- Vitals 


### Hypotheses
_Hypothesis 1:_ These Veterans can see all data as expected for each facility.  

## Method

### Moderated study: 
This moderated study will consist of observing participants while they verify that they are seeing their medical records for each facility in which they receive care. 

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.  

### Research materials
- [conversation guide](link)


## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. We require a very small cohort (n=3) and therefore will not be concerned with demographic or cognitive diversity. 

## Recruitment criteria
- All participants must receive care and 2 or more VA medical facilities
- All participants must have medical records for the following domains: vaccines, health conditions, allergies, labs, notes, vitals
  
Please exclude mobile users. Please exclude all assistive technology users as we cannot accommodate them in this study.

### Criteria Table

**No relevant criteria in Criteria Table; please see cohort geographical criteria (above) as primary reference. Did not extent Criteria Table to capture all cohorts as could not figure out to do this for 24 cohorts without making the table unreadable.** 

What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.
