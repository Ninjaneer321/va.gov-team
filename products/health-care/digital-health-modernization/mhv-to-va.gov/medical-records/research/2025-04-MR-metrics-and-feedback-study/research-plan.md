# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medical Records, Feb - Apr 2025

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially built and tested various iterations of Medications in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted usability studies and collected feedback that informed iterations on the website. This study is intended to continue monitoring the product through usage metrics and Veteran feedback.
