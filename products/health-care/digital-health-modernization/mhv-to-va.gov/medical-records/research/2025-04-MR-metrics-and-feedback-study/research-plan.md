# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medical Records, Feb - Apr 2025

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially built and tested various iterations of Medications in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted usability studies and collected feedback that informed iterations on the website. This study is intended to continue monitoring the product through usage metrics and Veteran feedback.

You can read more about our Digital Health Modernization strategy [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product).

## **OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

## **Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## **Research Goals**

1. Understand how Veterans are accessing information within their medical records.
2. Understand how much time Veterans are spending in the different Medical Records domains.
3. Uncover any pain points Veterans are experiencing.

## **Outcome**

The results of this study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to find and fill their medications. This will inform future design iterations and any further research strategy.

## **Research questions**

1. What methods are Veterans using to find information on their Medical Records?
2. How long are Veterans spending in the different Medical Records domains?
3. What pain points are Veterans communicating?

## **Hypothesis**

Hypothesis 1: Veterans view their records directly more often than they download Blue Button reports.

Hypothesis 2: Veterans spend the most amount of time in Lab and test results and Care summaries and notes.

Hypothesis 3: Veterans will share their frustrations with finding medical records information.

## **Methodology**

We will monitor Veteran usage with Datadog RUM and Google Analytics 4 metrics and Veteran feedback collected from Medallia Feedback and Intercept surveys.

## **Location**

Data collection will all be completed online.

## **Research materials**

## **Recruitment**

No Recruitment will be needed for this study.
