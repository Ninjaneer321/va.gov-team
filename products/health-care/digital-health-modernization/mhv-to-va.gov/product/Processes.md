# Product Processes on MHV FrontEnd

## Purpose

We want to ensure that all of the processes that we use between and among our teams on MHV FrontEnd continually operate with clarity and efficiency.  To that end, we want to advocate for consistency where possible, pariticularly in areas of overlap or interaction.  For this reason, we have identified Best Practices for the various processes that our teams practice regularly, and we will adjust and refine them as we go.  

The processes outlines below are intended to constrain, but to provide frameworks that all of our teams and members can easily navigate.
