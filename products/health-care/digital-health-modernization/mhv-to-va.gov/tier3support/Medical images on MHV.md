# Medical Images access on My HealtheVet

Actual images are not always included in an imaging report. This is a technical
constraint beyond MHV's control. If an image is available, a request button will appear at
the bottom of the report page.
* If there is an image file that is small enough to retrieve from the imaging system quickly,
the link to download the file will be displayed as soon as it’s ready.
* If the image is a large file, the link will be shown when the download is complete.
## What if my download request fails?
If the download request fails, and the user has opted in to Download Email Notifications
(under **Preferences**), an email will be sent letting them know.
The user can try to download the image again or contact their local ROI office to obtain
a hard copy of the image.
## What if my download request succeeds?
If the download request succeeds, and the user has opted in to Download Email
Notifications (under **Preferences**), an email will be sent letting them know it’s ready.
Image download files are currently available for 3 days after being requested.
## Next steps?
When the user goes back to MHV they will see a link to download the file, and it will tell
them how much time is left before the link expires. After 3 days, the file is deleted
from the file system to free up space, and the download button reappears (they can
request it again).
When a user downloads an image file, MHV has no control over where/how that file is
saved on their device. That is determined by their device and download preferences.
