# My HealtheVet - Medications Blue Sky Ideation
In July-August 2025, the Horizon team UX practitioners took on a discovery effort around the Medications tool with the goal of reimagining what would be possible if we could re-create the appliation from scratch today, knowing what we know now from user research and identified problems. 

UX squad: 
* Cara Frissell
* Florence McCafferty
* Sara Sterkenburg

OCTO:
* Robyn Singleton
* Kay Lawyer

## Background
What this discovery process included: 
* **Desk research** -_what research has already been done related to Medications? What do we know already about user expectations and preferences, pain points, and things that are going well?_
* **Competitive analysis:**
  * VA tools
    * VHAB mobile app: _How does prescription management on the app compare/contrast to flows and interactions we have for this same tool on the web?_
    * My VA Health portal: _How do users complete tasks such as refilling a medication, renewing a prescription, or printing out their medications history list? Can they track statuses or get shipping information?_
  * Non-VA health care tools - _what navigation styles, interactions, and features are available on other major pharmaceutical apps and websites? How do those compare to what we have on VA.gov?_
* **Design concepting** - With inputs from desk research and competitive analysis, what ideas to we have for how this application might be structured at a very high level?
