# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medications - Filter (Dec - Feb 2025)

## Background

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially built and tested various iterations of Medications in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted usability studies and collected feedback that informed iterations on the website. In a previous round of usability testing, we assessed the new functionality of the filter feature. This study is intended to continue monitoring the product through usage metrics and Veteran feedback.

You can read more about our Digital Health Modernization strategy [here](https://example-link.com).

## OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 
- Veterans can manage their health services online.
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

## Veteran Journey 

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's journey:
- Starting up 
- Taking care of myself 
- Retiring 
- Aging 

## Research Goals

- Understand how Veterans are using the filter feature.
- Uncover any pain points Veterans are experiencing using the filter.

## Outcome

The results of this study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to find their medications. This will inform future design iterations and any further research strategy.

## Research Questions

1. How are Veterans using the filter feature in Medications on VA.gov?
2. How frequently do Veterans use each filter option?
3. How frequently do Veterans show signs of frustration while using the filter?
4. What methods do Veterans use to navigate through their medications?

## Hypothesis

- **Hypothesis 1**: Veterans will use the Active filter more than the others.
- **Hypothesis 2**: Veterans will use the Active filter more than the others.
- **Hypothesis 3**: Veterans will show signs of frustration when they miss the Apply filter button.
- **Hypothesis 4**: Veterans will continue to use sort both independent of and in conjunction with filters.

## Methodology

We will monitor Veteran usage with Datadog RUM metrics and Veteran feedback collected from Medallia Feedback and Intercept surveys.

## Location

Data collection will all be completed online.
