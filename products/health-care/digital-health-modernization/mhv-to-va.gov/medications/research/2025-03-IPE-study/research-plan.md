# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medications, March 2025

## Background

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We initially built and tested a prototype of Medications in MHV on VA.gov. We conducted usability studies and collected feedback that informed iterations on the website. In this round of usability testing we will assess the new functionality of educational content and explore further pain points.

You can read more about our Digital Health Modernization strategy [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product).

## OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

# Veteran Journey

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals

1. Understand if Veterans notice the in-product education (IPE) components.
2. Understand how Veterans interact with the IPE components.
3. Understand Veterans’ perception of the IPE components.
4. Identify any pain points Veterans may experience in using the IPE components to help them understand Medications.  

## Outcome

The results of the study will help us determine if our designs provide the best user experience for Veterans to understand changes to Medications and to identify any pain points. This will inform future design iterations.

## Research questions

1. Does the in-product education (IPE) component help Veterans accomplish their goals in Medications on VA.gov?
2. How do Veterans interact with the IPE components?
3. What are Veterans’ perceptions of the IPE components?

## Hypothesis

_Hypothesis 1: Most Veterans will notice the IPE components._

_Hypothesis 2: Most Veterans will ignore the component on first seeing it but will choose “Don’t show again” on subsequent sightings._

_Hypothesis 3: Most Veterans will find the IPE components helpful._

## Methodology

We will conduct moderated usability testing sessions in which we will ask users to navigate a prototype while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

## Location

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
