## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?

My name is [name]. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If, for any reason and at any time, you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- We will, for the most part today, be talking through some of your experiences with MyHealtheVet. At some point, I will have you complete a task, which I will walk you through how. Then much later, I will have have you look at a prototype and complete some tasks. Please keep in mind that the prototype is only a demo tool, it may look familiar but would not act like you expect it to. I will guide you on the part that's functional.

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will take notes to ensure we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_[If yes:]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_[If no:] I_ appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

_[If yes:] Thank_ you! We very much appreciate you talking with us today.

_[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves]_

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?  We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- _[If yes: ]_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_[Start recording.]_

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

### **Participant Coaching**

Today we are just trying to hear and learn from you about your experience using the MyHealtheVet prescription tool. I will be asking you some questions and at some point, I will have you complete a task. Part of understanding how we can best improve this website is to understand what's working for our Veterans and what's not. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Your feedback today will help us make sure that we meet your needs and expectations on the website. Does that make sense?

Are you ready to dive in?

## **Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes**

- Do you use MHV to manage your VA prescriptions?
  - If yes, _[display PowerPoint showing the different platforms]_ which of these do you use?
    - _[If more than 1]_ which one do you use more often? How often?
  - Tell me what you do on _[selected platform(s)]_
- Do you get prescriptions filled anywhere else?
  - _[If yes]_ how do you decide which gets filled by VA?

## **Expectations on RX Page and Order - 10 minutes**

- When you log onto a page with your prescriptions on it, tell me what you are looking for first.
  - When you're looking for a particular prescription, what kind of information do you look for?
    - _Example optional prompts_: Prescription name? When it was issued to you? When you last filled it?
- On a list with your prescriptions, what do you expect to see?
  - What type of prescriptions do you expect to see at the top of the list?
  - What type of prescriptions do you expect to see at the bottom/end of the list?
- What do you expect to happen to prescriptions you no longer take or need?
- What should happen when you have a list of up to 100 prescriptions that you have acquired overtime? (including old, discontinued, expired, etc)

## **Task 1 – Card Sort - 5 minutes**

For this task, I would like you to show me what you have just explained.

_[Pull up screen for card sort]_

Looking at this screen, you will notice 10 randomly generated names of prescription. While I would love your feedback here, if you feel uncomfortable with any of these prescrtiptions at any time doing this, please let me know, I would be happy to cancel the activity.

In no particular order, please note that Expired are the ones you no longer have a prescription for, Active Prescripitions are the ones you are currently taking, Non-VA Active are the ones you are currently taking but not from the VA pharmacy, and Discontinued are the ones you are no longer prescribed to take.

What I would like to have you do is, based on what you have shared about your expectations, please move these cards in the order you expect to see them.

For example, _[mod will demonstrate]_

I will give you remote access to control my screen, that way you can move these prescriptions into the empty box simulating your prescription page.

While you sort the cards, if you could think aloud, that would be a big help. Keep in mind that there is no right or wrong answer here, I just want to better understand what you were describing.

Does that make sense? You can start once you are ready.

_[when Participant is done sorting]_

Thank you for taking the time to do that. Is there anything else you want to share about sorting these?

I am going to take back remote of the screen _[Assist participants if necessary]_

## **Finding a Prescription - 5 minutes**

- What is some information you have looked up in the past, about a prescription?

  - What has helped you successfully find that information?

- Have you ever used information on your prescription bottle when looking up anything related to a prescription online?

  - _[If yes]_ Tell me the information you used?

## **Prescription not found - 5 minutes**

- What have you done in the past when you could not find a prescription on your list?
  - _[If they haven't had this issue]_ Let's say you are helping a friend or family member who is having trouble finding their specific prescription. What would you do?
- Let's say that you need to recall the dosage of a prescription that you have not used for a few years, where would you look for that information?

  - What would you do if you couldn't remember the name of the prescription?

- If there was a way to look for a prescription? Talk to me about how you would use that feature.

## **Similar Prescriptions - 3 minutes**

- What are your thoughts on prescriptions that have the same name but are different? (Either by status or dosage) [_Show example]_
  - How would you find a prescription that has the same name as another prescription but a different dosage?

## **Online Pharmacy - 5 minutes**

- What are some things on your online pharmacy that have helped to manage your prescriptions?
- Tell me what you like about your online pharmacy, when it comes tomanaging your prescriptions?
- Tell me what you don't like about your online pharmacy, when it comes to managing your prescriptions?

## **Multi-Refill - 5 minutes**

- Say that you want to refill all the prescriptions on your list, that are refillable, walk me through how you will do that from here.
  - _[If they tried clicking each of the checkboxes, ask]_ Talk to me about why you wanted to check each of the boxes? What are your thoughts on 'select all'?
  - Tell me about your experience doing that?

## **Interview Wrap Up – 5 minutes**

- What are your thoughts about everything we reviewed today?
  - Was there anything I missed that you would like to share?
- Any there any other feedback that would be good for us to know?

## **Screener Interview – Participants with CD**

Thank you for taking the time to get through all those tasks with me today and answering all our questions. It has been super helpful.

Before I let you go, I have a confirmation question to clarify with you, we just want to make sure that we accurately represent all the information you presented. Please note that this is completely optional, it is up to you to answer these questions or decide not to.

This is regarding a response you gave us upon your submission to be a part of this study. May I go ahead and ask these confirmation questions? Again, it is up to you to answer or opt out.

_When confirmed:_

- In your screener, you answered yes when asked about a cognitive disability. Could you confirm if this is correct information?

_If yes_

- Would you mind sharing a little about how your cognitive disability affects your use of My HealtheVet or other websites?
  - _[possible follow up]_ Can you share an example of a time when you struggled with My HealtheVet because of your disability?

## **Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes**

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you so much again and enjoy the rest of your day!

## **Emergency Exit**
