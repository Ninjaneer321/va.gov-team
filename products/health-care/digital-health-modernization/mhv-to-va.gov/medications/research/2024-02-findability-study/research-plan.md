# **Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Medications Findability Study, February 2024**

## **Background**

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. In this round of testing, we will be conducting interview sessions to Veterans' pain points when finding and accessing information about their prescriptions. This effort reflects our commitment to creating a user-centric tool that meets the unique needs of all Veterans, to streamline their access to prescriptions.

As part of this study, we will also be testing a prototype designed based on previous usability feedback regarding refilling multiple prescriptions.

You can read more about our Digital Health Modernization strategy here.

**OCTO Objectives**

This research supports the following OCTO objectives:

1. Veterans can manage their health services online.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

**Veteran Journey**

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## **Research Goals**

1. Identify how Veterans find a medication in My HealtheVet or VAHB-Mobile.
2. Identify how Veterans find information on their medication(s).
3. Identify how Veterans make sense of their medication list(s).
4. Identify how Veterans' experiences with My HealtheVet/VAHB-Mobile and other websites/apps inform their expectations.

## **Outcome**

The results of this study will help us determine what is and isn't working for our Veterans when accessing their prescriptions on MHV. The findings from this study will help us determine how to best design a User Experience that allows Veterans to find their prescriptions and access information about their prescriptions easily and efficiently.

## **Research questions**

1. What do Veterans expect to see on their Medications page?
2. What type of medication information do Veterans seek?
    1. How do they find the information?
3. What do Veterans do if they cannot find a medication?
 

## **Hypothesis**

_Hypothesis 1:_ Most Veterans will find the current UI of prescription findability efficient.

_Hypothesis 2:_ Most Veterans will find their prescriptions by scrolling through the pages.

_Hypothesis 3:_ Most Veterans will state they would call their providers when they cannot find a prescription on their list.

## **Methodology**

We will conduct moderated interview sessions in which we will ask users questions about their experience with finding prescription information. We will ask follow-up questions to further explore user pain points as needed.

## **Location**

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.

## **Research materials**
