# In Product Education Initative Brief

## Outcome Summary
As we transition Veterans to our new MHV portal we want a way to introduce them to draw their attention to new features, patterns and expectations.  This initative is meant to gain users trust and give them confidence in the new MHV portal.  The outcome of this feature should lead to increased user satistisfaction of the MHV portal on VA.gov and an increase in user adoption of the portal.

## Problem
* VADS and USWDS don't have an in product education component that helps users note and understand changes to the UI as a means to help onboard them to new use patterns / expectations.
* Users are used to behaviors and patterns in MHV and are sometimes confused or unsure of how to interact with things that change in the UI on MHV on VA.gov.
* For example:
  * On Secure Messaging - we have moved the secondary folders (drafts, trash, sent, my folders) from left side navigation to tabs at the top of the UI.  Users have reported through Medallia feedback that we have removed these from VA.gov becuase they aren't able to find them.
  * On Medications - we've consolidated multiple lists on MHV into one list on MHV. Users have reported through Medallia feedback that their lists are too long or they can't find what their looking for like active prescriptions.  Filters on VA.gov was launched in December 2025 as an accoridon but users may not be familiar with this feature or why they should use it.
* This initative contributes to OCTOs OKR of improving satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Users read the educational content within the new IPE component and familiarize themselves with the changes and new behaviors on VA.gov to be able to get the most out of their experience.
- Users should become more confident in using the new MHV portal and increase their trust and satisfaction on the MHV on VA.gov portal.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users dismiss the IPE before reading comprehending the content.
- Users get too familiar with this component and stop reading the content inside.
- User satisfaction on the MHV on VA.gov portal goes down.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Behavior changes get communicated to users.
- We are able to confidently move users to the new portal experience due to increased CSAT and improved user communciations.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- UX teams over use the component and it becomes overlooked by users.
