### Day of the session

### Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Moderator Name] and I'll be moderating. One of my colleagues will be taking notes throughout the session. Today we're going to talk about your experience using your VA patient portal to manage your healthcare online. We will ask you to walk us through how you see what's new in your healht portal, schedule an appointment, and refill medications when you need more. We may jump around through these topics depending on what exists in your medical record. Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This session will take about 60 minutes.
- During this session, we'll be asking you to share your screen which will show your personal health records. Your participation is completely voluntary. You can stop at any time. You can choose to show us one thing but not another - this is your choice. There will be no repercussions on your VA benefits if you want to stop at any point or don't want to share some information with us.
- Are you comfortable sharing your screen while you navigate your VA health records?
  - [Record Answer]
- I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with a couple of observers joining us?
  - If no: Ask observers to leave.
  - If yes: Admit observers and have them do quick intros, then turn off cameras.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio during this session? We use these recordings to confirm that we have an accurate record of what we learn from you, and refer back to them to make sure we are not misremembering anything. We save these files on the VA network and destroy them after the study is finished.

## Warm-up (5 mins) 


## Part 1: Production / How participant accesses and manages their healthcare now (20 mins)

### Sign in and show us how they access their patient portal
* Can you tell me about the last time you signed into your health portal to do something? What were you trying to do, and how was your experience? 
* Could you show me how you typically get to your patient portal to manage your healthcare online now?
* What other things do you typically do when you are here?
  

## Part 2: Prototype / Reactions to planned tactics (20 mins) 

### Opening the Figma prototype
- For this portion of the interview, we will be using what we call a prototype. This is not an actual website. It is a file that we use to explore what the website could look like and get feedback from users like yourself before we make any final changes to the website. This prototype will not work exactly like a website but all information is fake. For example, not all of the links will work and you cannot click the back button in your browser because it will take you away from the prototype.

- To get to the prototype, I need you to go back to the Zoom window and click on the chat icon at the bottom of your screen. It should look like a little conversation bubble with three dots inside. Do you see it?
- In the chat I just dropped a link to a prototype. Can you select that link? It will open up in a web browser momentarily.
- Like I said before, this is not an actual website, it is a prototype. But it will look a lot like the VA.gov website and we will show you some ideas that we exploring.


## Consent to use video clips
- I want to circle back and re-confirm: Are you okay with us sharing anonymized video clips from todayâ€™s session with VA partners?
- Is there any part of our conversation you would NOT want included?
  - [Record answer here]
