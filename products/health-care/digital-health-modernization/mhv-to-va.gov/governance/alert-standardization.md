# My HealtheVet on VA.gov | Alert Standardization
Within the My HealtheVet portal, multiple alerts are required to display in one, many, or all applications that live within the `/my-health` namespace. This document seeks to explain the logic and standardized alert designs for each of these scenarios, so that all teams are aligned and deliver end-users a consistent user experience. 

## On this page: 
* High-level API access logic 
* ID-verification alerts
* No access to My HealtheVet alerts
* Account Creation API error alerts
* Oracle-Health / Cerner Routing alerts (guidance coming soon)
* 404 page not found alerts (guidance coming soon)
