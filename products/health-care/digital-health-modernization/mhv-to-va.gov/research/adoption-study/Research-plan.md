# Research plan for Adoption of My HealtheVet on VA.gov Generative Study

## Background
The My HealtheVet on VA.gov team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov. This research is in large part intended to inform our understanding of pain points that our users experience in transitioning to a new VA health care portal.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the following OCTO objective:
Veterans can manage their health services online


### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	
- What hinders our users from discovering and returning to MHV on VA.gov?
- What unintentional friction are our users encountering on MHV on 
VA.gov?
- What information about new features on VA.gov might counter-balance
the challenges associated with switching to the new portal?

### Outcome
The learnings of this research will inform changes to the MHV on VA.gov experience and strategy for change management.

### Research questions
- Are CTAs to try out the new MHV portal effective? Do users notice them
and understand what they're saying?
- Once users try out the new portal, do they understand how to return?
- Are changes made to national portal language or tools causing confusion?
- What challenges or hiccups are users encountering on the new portal?
- What are positive changes that users notice while using the new portal?
- How much do users care about what the new MHV offers them?

### Hypothesis
- The majority of our users do not know that MHV is moving over to VA.gov, even directly after using the national portal. Many of them do not know what this change would or could mean for them outside of understanding that this change will pose a challenge to them that theywould prefer to avoid.
- The guidance to try MHV on VA.gov is unclear and the user journey to get to MHV on VA.gov is disjointed and confusing.
- Users will be interested in what we’ve decided are the most important or useful differentiators between the two portals but only those with a great deal of MHV experience will seem excited about the changes.

## Methodology	
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. The interviews will require users to share their screens and demonstrate how they complete a task (or tasks, plural) on the national portal, and on the VA.gov portal. While we observe the participant as they navigate, we will also pose direct questions to understand how they are thinking about different aspects of their experience. When this part is complete, we will move to the second part of the interview, which will be a series of statements that the user will read andrate based on how they feel in response to the statements.

### Location
These research sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom.

### Research materials
- Conversation guide
- Statements for second part of interview
- Mural board for note-taking and synthesis
	
## Recruitment	
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans and we request a kickoff meeting with Perigean. We anticipate that the kickoff meeting will last 30 minutes. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information in an encrypted Excel file on the VA Network.

Availability for potential kickoff meeting times with Perigean:
- 


### Recruitment criteria
We are aiming to speak to Veterans that are more likely to be able to independently navigate technical difficulties without relying on external help to gain access to and use the new portal.

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
**Please do not include email addresses in this section.** We previously required email addresses. VA's GitHub policy ([see announcement](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/discussions/13)) has changed. VA.gov email addresses cannot be in public repositories.

**Please list the names of people in each role.** In the Slack study channel, send an email and primary phone number for the moderator. Send emails only for the notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker.

- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers: List the names of people observing the sessions. This includes VA stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, and any other people who might find this research relevant to their work. Spread observers across sessions. There should be no more than 5 to 6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side.
