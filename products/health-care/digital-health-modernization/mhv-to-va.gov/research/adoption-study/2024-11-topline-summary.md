This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholders/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes 

Note: We will gather numbers for appropriate findings during final synthesis

## Research Goals	
- What hinders our users from discovering and returning to MHV on VA.gov?
- What unintentional friction are our users encountering on MHV on 
VA.gov?
- What information about new features on VA.gov might counter-balance
the challenges associated with switching to the new portal?

### Hypothesis
- The majority of our users do not know that MHV is moving over to VA.gov, even directly after using the national portal. Many of them do not know what this change would or could mean for them outside of understanding that this change will pose a challenge to them that theywould prefer to avoid.
- The guidance to try MHV on VA.gov is unclear and the user journey to get to MHV on VA.gov is disjointed and confusing.
- Users will be interested in what weâ€™ve decided are the most important or useful differentiators between the two portals but only those with a great deal of MHV experience will seem excited about the changes.

## Initial Findings

**Research question 1**: Are CTAs to try out the new MHV portal effective? Do users notice them
and understand what they're saying?


**Research question 2**: Once users try out the new portal, do they understand how to return?

**Research question 3**: Are changes made to the national portal language or tools causing confusion?

**Research question 4**: What challenges or hiccups are users encountering on the new portal?

**Research question 5**: What are positive changes that users notice while using the new portal?

**Research question 6**: How much do users care about what the new MHV offers them?



## Other takeaways 

9. All participants attempted to locate CPAP supplies under Medications 
   - Participants associated needing a prescription with CPAP supplies and therefore looked under Medications. 
   - Participants may have also perceived the four navigation links as the only options during the study.  

10. Most participants expected an intermediate landing page (a broader landing page where they could choose where to go) before arriving on a specific secure message.  
    - Several participants seem confused about coming into My HealtheVet through a side door (an email). Further analysis is needed if it was the narrative around the study or the mental model of participants (email from My HealtheVet > landing page experience first).
