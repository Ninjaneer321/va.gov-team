This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholders/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes 

Note: We will gather numbers for appropriate findings during final synthesis

## Research Goals	
- What hinders our users from discovering and returning to MHV on VA.gov?
- What unintentional friction are our users encountering on MHV on 
VA.gov?
- What information about new features on VA.gov might counter-balance
the challenges associated with switching to the new portal?

### Hypothesis
- The majority of our users do not know that MHV is moving over to VA.gov, even directly after using the national portal. Many of them do not know what this change would or could mean for them outside of understanding that this change will pose a challenge to them that they would prefer to avoid.
    - Partially true: Participants were able to conceptualize the My HealtheVet to VA.gov migration to some extent. However, perceived challenges, such as sign-in/learning a new thing were potential blockers. 
      
- The guidance to try MHV on VA.gov is unclear and the user journey to get to MHV on VA.gov is disjointed and confusing.
    - Partially true: Participants seemed to understand the messaging within the "Try-me" banner. However, participants often scrolled past the banner.
    - The journey between MHV National portal and MHV on VA.gov was disjoined and introduced confusion. 

- Users will be interested in what weâ€™ve decided are the most important or useful differentiators between the two portals but only those with a great deal of MHV experience will seem excited about the changes.
    - True: Participants were excited about having benefits, health care, and other VA information in one place. Also, managing Community Care appointments and direct scheduling were positives for participants. 

## Initial Findings

**Research question 1**: Are CTAs to try out the new MHV portal effective? Do users notice them
and understand what they're saying?

Participants repeatedly scrolled past the "Try-me" banners on the My HealtheVet national portal. 

**Possible reasons:**

**Participants are focused on accomplishing task/goals**

> "If I've already made it this far to the page, I don't care about all this. I"m already where I was trying to be" - P2

> "Hmm..no, i usually scroll really fast and went right down to my appointments. - P13

**Participants often had multiple/stacked banners/alerts seemingly blending into each other which caused some confusion.**

> "3 boxes all the same color makes it seem like these are all the same information." - P2

**Some participants skimmed the first banner on the page and language like "retiring MHV" password seemed to add confusion.**

> "And then at once point, it's giving you the option to cancel your MHV. But if you do that you can't get into any of this stuff . So why are they doing that?" - P12

**Some participants felt that the banners/alerts did not apply to them.**

> "I have all these banners here and I tend to ignore them."  - P9

> No, honestly I look past these most of the time. I used to pay attention to them when I first started using MHV but it seemed that none of it was truly important." - P5

**Participants generally were able to conceptualize and explain the transition happening between MHV and VA.gov. However, participants were unclear how the changes will affect their use of My HealtheVet.Uncertainly such as having to sign in again and functionality were potential blockers for participants.** 

> "I think it will take me to VA.gov, but I wonder if it will make me login again." - P10

> "I won't come to Va.gov until it's fully functional. Now I have to click one more time to go back. Nobody wants to turn backward" - P 13

**Research question 2**: Once users try out the new portal, do they understand how to return?

**Research question 3**: Are changes made to the national portal language or tools causing confusion?

**Research question 4**: What challenges or hiccups are users encountering on the new portal?

**Research question 5**: What are positive changes that users notice while using the new portal?

**Research question 6**: How much do users care about what the new MHV offers them?



## Other takeaways 

9. All participants attempted to locate CPAP supplies under Medications 
   - Participants associated needing a prescription with CPAP supplies and therefore looked under Medications. 
   - Participants may have also perceived the four navigation links as the only options during the study.  

10. Most participants expected an intermediate landing page (a broader landing page where they could choose where to go) before arriving on a specific secure message.  
    - Several participants seem confused about coming into My HealtheVet through a side door (an email). Further analysis is needed if it was the narrative around the study or the mental model of participants (email from My HealtheVet > landing page experience first).
