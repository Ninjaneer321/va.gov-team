## Research Goals

This research aims to assess users' understanding, reactions, and expectations to the transition of My HealtheVet to VA.gov. We wanted to achieve the specific goals of: 

- What hinders our users from discovering and returning to MHV on VA.gov?
- What unintentional friction are our users encountering on MHV on VA.gov?
- What information about new features on VA.gov might counter-balance the challenges associated with switching to the new portal? 

## Research Questions

- Are CTAs to try out the new MHV portal effective? Do users notice them
and understand what they're saying?
- Once users try out the new portal, do they understand how to return?
- Are changes made to national portal language or tools causing confusion?
- What challenges or hiccups are users encountering on the new portal?
- What are positive changes that users notice while using the new portal?
- How much do users care about what the new MHV offers them?

## Methodology 

We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. The interviews will require users to share their screens and demonstrate how they complete a task (or tasks, plural) on the national portal, and on the VA.gov portal. While we observe the participant as they navigate, we will also pose direct questions to understand how they are thinking about different aspects of their experience. When this part is complete, we will move to the second part of the interview, which will be a series of statements that the user will read andrate based on how they feel in response to the statements.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The majority of our users do not know that MHV is moving over to VA.gov, even directly after using the national portal. Many of them do not know what this change would or could mean for them outside of understanding that this change will pose a challenge to them that they would prefer to avoid.
    - Likely true: Participants were able to conceptualize the My HealtheVet to VA.gov migration to some extent. However, perceived challenges, such as sign-in/learning a new thing were potential blockers.
2. The guidance to try MHV on VA.gov is unclear and the user journey to get to MHV on VA.gov is disjointed and confusing.
    - Likely true: Participants seemed to understand the messaging within the "Try-me" banner. However, the journey between MHV National portal and MHV on VA.gov was disjoined and introduced confusion.
3. Users will be interested in what we’ve decided are the most important or useful differentiators between the two portals but only those with a great deal of MHV experience will seem excited about the changes.
    - Definitely True/Not enough information: Participants were excited about having benefits, health care, and other VA information in one place. Also, managing Community Care appointments and direct scheduling were positives for participants. 

## Key Findings

1. Participants ignored the "Try Me" banners on the My HealtheVet National Portal, scrolling past them. 
2. Most participants generally understood the concept of the My HealtheVet to VA.gov transition, however, significant uncertainty remained regarding its practical implications. 
3. Even among those who could conceptualize the transition, participants often conflated the My HealtheVet National Portal with My HealtheVet on VA.gov.
4. While participants identified ways to access My HealtheVet on VA.gov in the future, such as using bookmarks, the study highlighted challenges in navigating back to My HealtheVet on VA.gov. 
5. Participants identified My HealtheVet on VA.gov as a familiar portal for healthcare, with most participants expressing positive views on the  updates.
6. The secondary navigation proved effective in supporting both participant orientation and navigation amongst the various tools within the health portal.

## Details of Findings 

### 1. Participants ignored the "Try Me" banners on the My HealtheVet National Portal, scrolling past them. 

Among the ten participants, none engaged with the "Try Me" banners promoting My HealtheVet on VA.gov. Participants' task-focused behavior, banner overload, and perceived irrelevant messaging contributed to the lack of engagement.

**_All 10 participants demonstrated a strong focus on task completion and scrolled past the banner._**

> "If I've already made it this far to the page, I don't care about all this. I"m already where I was trying to be." - P2

> "Hmm, no, I usually scroll really fast and went right down to my appointments." - P13

**_At least 5 of 10 participants experienced banner overload. The presentation of two to three vertically stacked banners of similar coloration resulted in a lack of visual differentiation among them._**

> "3 boxes all the same color makes it seem like these are all the same information." - P2

> "I have all these banners here and I tend to ignore them." - P9

> "And then at once point, it's giving you the option to cancel your MHV. But if you do that you can't get into any of this stuff . So why are they doing that?" - P12

**_Some participants perceived the banners as irrelevant._**

> No, honestly I look past these most of the time. I used to pay attention to them when I first started using MHV but it seemed that none of it was truly important." - P5

### 2. Most participants generally understood the concept of the My HealtheVet to VA.gov transition, however, significant uncertainty remained regarding its practical implications. 

Despite a conceptual understanding of the My HealtheVet to VA.gov transition, most participants (8 of 10) expressed considerable uncertainty, citing concerns about workflow disruptions, repeated login requirements, and possible loss of functionality. 

3 participants mentioned disruption of workflow: 

> "There is no driver to make me want to click on that, especially when everything is still available as an option" - P2

3 Participants mentioned login: 

> "I think it will take me to VA.gov, but I wonder if it will make me login again...My concern is I'm already on MHV. Do I have to login again and go through that frustration?" - P10

2 Participants mentioned functionality (specifically Medical records): 

> "I won't come to VA.gov until it's fully functional. Now I have to click one more time to go back. Nobody wants to turn backward." - P 13

---

### 3. Participants frequently conflated the My HealtheVet National Portal and My HealtheVet on VA.gov. 

Despite the conceptual understanding of the transition and being able to articulate this transition, participants a persistent challenge in differentiating between the two My HealtheVet platforms among users.

### 4. While participants identified ways to access My HealtheVet on VA.gov in the future, such as using bookmarks, the sessions highlighted challenges in navigating back to My HealtheVet on VA.gov. 

Participants frequently described or demonstrated convoluted or roundabout paths to return to the platform.
