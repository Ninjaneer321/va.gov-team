## Research Goals

This research aims to assess users' understanding, reactions, and expectations to the transition of My HealtheVet to VA.gov. We wanted to achieve the specific goals of: 

- What hinders our users from discovering and returning to MHV on VA.gov?
- What unintentional friction are our users encountering on MHV on VA.gov?
- What information about new features on VA.gov might counter-balance the challenges associated with switching to the new portal? 

## Research Questions

- Are CTAs to try out the new MHV portal effective? Do users notice them
and understand what they're saying?
- Once users try out the new portal, do they understand how to return?
- Are changes made to national portal language or tools causing confusion?
- What challenges or hiccups are users encountering on the new portal?
- What are positive changes that users notice while using the new portal?
- How much do users care about what the new MHV offers them?

## Methodology 

We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. The interviews will require users to share their screens and demonstrate how they complete a task (or tasks, plural) on the national portal, and on the VA.gov portal. While we observe the participant as they navigate, we will also pose direct questions to understand how they are thinking about different aspects of their experience. When this part is complete, we will move to the second part of the interview, which will be a series of statements that the user will read andrate based on how they feel in response to the statements.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The majority of our users do not know that MHV is moving over to VA.gov, even directly after using the national portal. Many of them do not know what this change would or could mean for them outside of understanding that this change will pose a challenge to them that they would prefer to avoid.
    - Likely true: Participants were able to conceptualize the My HealtheVet to VA.gov migration to some extent. However, perceived challenges, such as sign-in/learning a new thing were potential blockers.
2. The guidance to try MHV on VA.gov is unclear and the user journey to get to MHV on VA.gov is disjointed and confusing.
    - Likely true: Participants seemed to understand the messaging within the "Try-me" banner. However, the journey between MHV National portal and MHV on VA.gov was disjoined and introduced confusion.
3. Users will be interested in what we’ve decided are the most important or useful differentiators between the two portals but only those with a great deal of MHV experience will seem excited about the changes.
    - Definitely True/Not enough information: Participants were excited about having benefits, health care, and other VA information in one place. Also, managing Community Care appointments and direct scheduling were positives for participants.

## Key Findings

1. Participants ignored the "Try Me" banners on the My HealtheVet National Portal, scrolling past them. 
2. Participants generally understood the concept of the My HealtheVet to VA.gov transition, however, significant uncertainty remained regarding its practical implications. 
3. Participants frequently conflated the My HealtheVet National Portal and My HealtheVet on VA.gov, even those who understood the transition conceptually.
4. Participants identified ways to access My HealtheVet on VA.gov in the future (such as using bookmarks), but the sessions revealed difficulties navigating back to My HealtheVet on VA.gov, with participants often describing or demonstrating circuitous routes.
5. Participants identified My HealtheVet on VA.gov as a familiar portal for healthcare, with most participants expressing positive views on the  updates.
6. The secondary navigation proved effective in facilitating both orientation to the health portal and navigation among the various tools.

## Details of Findings 

---
### 1. Participants ignored the "Try Me" banners on the My HealtheVet National Portal, scrolling past them. 

Among the ten participants, none engaged with the "Try Me" banners promoting My HealtheVet on VA.gov. Participants' task-focused behavior, banner overload, and perceived irrelevant messaging contributed to the lack of engagement. 

- Participants demonstrated a strong focus on task completion and scrolled past the banner.

> "If I've already made it this far to the page, I don't care about all this. I"m already where I was trying to be" - P2

> "Hmm, no, I usually scroll really fast and went right down to my appointments." - P13

- At least 5 of 10 participants experienced banner overload. Some participants saw three similarly colored banners stacked that seemingly blended. 

> "3 boxes all the same color makes it seem like these are all the same information." - P2

> "I have all these banners here and I tend to ignore them." - P9

> "And then at once point, it's giving you the option to cancel your MHV. But if you do that you can't get into any of this stuff . So why are they doing that?" - P12
  
- **Most participants perceived the banners as irrelevant messaging**

> No, honestly I look past these most of the time. I used to pay attention to them when I first started using MHV but it seemed that none of it was truly important." - P5
