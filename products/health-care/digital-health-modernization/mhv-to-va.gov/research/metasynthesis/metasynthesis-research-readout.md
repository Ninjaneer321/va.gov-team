# My HealtheVet - Metasynthesis research readout
By: Athena Bozak, Florence McCafferty, Jonathan Nelson, Sara Sterkenburg

## Executive Summary

In February 2025, the Cartography Team worked with OCTO research lead Robyn Singleton to analyze past research studies in the VA research repository through the lens of high-level research questions related to both My HealtheVet and the broader authenticated experience on VA.gov. We hoped to surface any insights that rang true across multiple studies and measure our degree of confidence in that insight. From our confidence in these insights or findings, we believe research insights with a high degree of confidence can unblock strategic business decisions that will generate known user value. Research insights with a low degree of confidence indicate that additional research will need to be conducted to confirm whether or not they are ripe for design solutioning. In effect, this research report seeks to develop a research and design roadmap: exposing known pain points in the user's navigation and behavioral experience that can move into solutioning; and possible pain points, where further research study development would make the most sense as the business is able to take it on.
