# My HealtheVet - Metasynthesis research readout
By: Athena Bozak, Florence McCafferty, Jonathan Nelson, Sara Sterkenburg

## Executive Summary

In February 2025, the Cartography Team worked with OCTO research lead Robyn Singleton to analyze past research studies in the VA research repository through the lens of high-level research questions related to both My HealtheVet and the broader authenticated experience on VA.gov. We hoped to surface any insights that rang true across multiple studies and measure our degree of confidence in that insight. From our confidence in these insights or findings, we believe research insights with a high degree of confidence can unblock strategic business decisions that will generate known user value. Research insights with a low degree of confidence indicate that additional research will need to be conducted to confirm whether or not they are ripe for design solutioning. In effect, this research report seeks to develop a research and design roadmap: exposing known pain points in the user's navigation and behavioral experience that can move into solutioning; and possible pain points, where further research study development would make the most sense as the business is able to take it on.

## <a name="questions"></a>Research questions <br>
1.  **What are the most consistent health-related navigational pain points (health specific)?**
    * What are the common issues or frustrations Veterans face when trying to find or use health-related tools and information on MHV?
2. **What are the highest impact navigation-related pain points (General/all of VA?)**
    * What navigation problems that cause the biggest challenges or make it hardest for Veterans to accomplish their tasks?
3. **How do behaviors differ (or don’t) in the health space compared with the benefits space (health/ general all of VA)?**
    * Do Veterans use My HealtheVet (health) differently than they use VA.gov for benefits? If so, how? If not, what’s the same?
4. **What do Veterans expect from an authenticated experience on VA.gov that includes benefits from a range of VA sub-agencies? (general/all of VA)**
    * What do Veterans want or expect when they log in to VA.gov, especially when it comes to easily accessing benefits and services from different VA departments (like health care, education, or disability)?
5. **What are the use cases where there’s overlap between health and other areas, where people might not find what they need in the health space? (Health/general all of VA)**
    * When do Veterans’ needs for health-related tools or information cross over into other areas (like benefits or education), and where does this overlap cause confusion or make it hard for them to find what they need?

**Identifying a pool of previous studies**
Our team identified and analyzed 41 previous studies that we thought were most relevant to re-analysis in order to identify the rationale for previous decisions within My HealtheVet and broader authenticated experience, as well as surfacing any pain points that may still persist in 2025. These studies were initially conducted by a wide variety of teams and OCTO leads, from card-sort and tree-test studies, VAHB mobile app personalization studies, studies on the VA.gov homepage redesign, adjacent healthcare application, and more. A full list of citations to the 41 studies that were reviewed are listed below in the "Sources cited" section. 

**Seeking specific information**
We re-analyzed these studies, looking for research findings that touched on comprehension and navigation pain points, which rolled up to our core research questions. Since many of these studies are multiple years old, primary pain points or problems may have been solved or remedied already, so the current validity of old findings is certainly a quesiton. We paid some attention to our knowledge of what has and has not changed since each study occurred. We realized that this is an imperfect process. 

We bubbled up themes related to our research questions from each study, and if a given theme rang true across _more than one study_, we considered it a "finding" for the purposes of this report. However, our confidence in the validity of that finding was determined based on an evidence rating rubric. We used this rubric (see section below) to rank our findings as "low  our confidence in the severity and validity that they represent in terms of the broader user experience both within and beyond the health portal on VA.gov.
