# ‘Share My Health Data’ App and ‘Account Activity’ IA Research Plan | MHV on VA.gov  

## Background  
As My HealtheVet (MHV) transitions to VA.gov, integrating key features from MHV Classic, such as **Share My Health Data** and **Account Activity History**, requires a clear understanding of where authenticated users expect to find them. While these features support Veterans in managing their health data and tracking account activity, their placement within VA.gov has not yet been determined. Identifying where users naturally look for these tools will help ensure they are easily accessible and aligned with their expectations.

In MHV Classic, Veterans tracked health metrics through a self-reporting tool that required manual entry. The Office of Connected Care’s (OCC) Share My Health Data app expands on this functionality by enabling automatic synchronization with smart health devices, reducing the need for manual input and streamlining data sharing with VA care teams. For devices that are not compatible, users would still be able to manually log key health metrics, including blood pressure, heart rate, glucose, pulse oximetry, temperature, and weight.

Account Activity History is a legally mandated feature that provides authenticated MHV users with a record of their account activity, including who accessed their account, what information was viewed, any changes made, and the type of action performed. 

This study will examine user expectations for the placement of feature links within MHV on VA.gov. Insights from the findings will guide decisions on site structure, optimizing discoverability, enhancing usability, and ensuring alignment with user mental models.

## OCTO Priorities  
**Objective 1:** VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.  
**Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.  

## Veteran Journey  
- Starting up  
- Taking care of myself  
- Putting down roots  
- Retiring  
- Aging  

## Research Goals  
This study aims to:  
- Identify where authenticated users expect to find the **‘Share My Health Data’** and **‘Account Activity History’** links within MHV on VA.gov.  
- Evaluate whether users’ expectations align with mental models from MHV Classic.  
- Uncover gaps between expected and intended feature placement in MHV on VA.gov.  

## Outcome  
Findings will provide insights into the optimal placement and structure of these features, including:  
- Where users naturally expect to find **Share My Health Data** and **Account Activity History**.  
- How these expectations align with MHV Classic navigation patterns.  
- Gaps in discoverability that may require IA refinements.  

## Research Questions  
- Where do MHV users expect to find **‘Share My Health Data’** within MHV on VA.gov?  
- Where do MHV users expect to find **‘Account Activity History’** within MHV on VA.gov?  
- What challenges do users face in locating the ‘Share My Health Data’ and ‘Account Activity History’ features within MHV on VA.gov, and how can the information architecture be improved to enhance discoverability?
- Does the labeling of the ‘Account Activity History’ link align with users’ expectations, or would alternative terminology improve clarity and findability?   

## Hypotheses  
### **Share My Health Data Link**  
- Users will primarily expect to find **‘Share My Health Data’** within the **Health Records** section, as it logically aligns with personal health management.  
- Users familiar with MHV Classic may experience confusion if they expect to find a **‘Track Your Health’** or **‘Shared Vitals’** section instead.  

### **Account Activity History Link**  
- Users will **not** expect to find this link on the MHV landing page, as existing categories—Appointments, Messages, Medication, Records, Payments, and Medical Supplies—do not logically align with it.  
- Users familiar with MHV Classic will expect to find **‘Account Activity History’** under **‘Profile’**, mirroring past navigation patterns.  
- Users who perceive **‘Account Activity History’** as a security feature will look for it within **‘Profile’ → ‘Account Security’** options.  

## Methodology  
A tree test study will be conducted using Optimal Workshop (Treejack) to assess where MHV users expect to find the **‘Share My Health Data’** and **‘Account Activity History’** feature links within VA.gov. Participants will complete task-based scenarios in an unmoderated study to evaluate their navigation patterns and expectations.  

### **Location**  
- Unmoderated study via Optimal Workshop (Treejack).  

### **Recruitment**  
We will recruit **100 MHV users** through our recruitment partners, Perigean, based on the following criteria:  

**Group 1 (50 participants):**  
- Users who have experience using health data-sharing tools, such as manually inputting or sharing vitals on My HealtheVet.  
- Have accessed their account activity history at least once within the last six months.  

**Group 2 (50 participants):**  
- Users with no prior experience with health data sharing or account activity history.  
- Have been active MHV users within the last six months.  

### **Availability for Potential Kickoff Meeting Times with Perigean**  
- Monday, March 10: 9:00 AM - 2:00 PM (PST) 
- Tuesday, March 11: 9:00 AM - 2:00 PM (PST) 

### **Recruitment Approach**  
We will partner with Perigean to recruit 100 participants for this tree test study, aiming to launch no later than March 13, 2025. Our focus is on MHV-authenticated users, including:  
- Veterans who have previously shared or manually entered their health data.  
- Veterans who have accessed their account activity history on MHV Classic.  
- Active MHV users who have no prior experience with these features.  

### **Recruitment Criteria**  
#### **Primary Criteria (Must-Haves)**  
**All Participants:**  
- Must be Veteransor authenticated users on MHV Classic or MHV on VA.gov.  
- Must have a computer and be willing to complete **task-based scenarios on a third-party testing platform.  
- Must have signed into My HealtheVet at least once in the past.  

#### **Group 1 (50 participants)**  
- Have experience using health data-sharing tools (e.g., manually inputting or sharing vitals on My HealtheVet Classic).  
- Have accessed their Account Activity History at least once in the last six months.  

#### **Group 2 (50 participants)**  
- Have no prior experience with health data sharing or account activity history.  
- Have been active MHV users (Classic or MHV on VA.gov) within the last six months.  

**Recruitment Adjustment:**  
- If two weeks pass without fully meeting Group 1 criteria, we will broaden eligibility to include participants with experience in at least one of these features.  

## Length of Sessions  
- Unmoderated  
- Aim for ~15 minutes per session

## Timeline  
- **3/6:** Finalize research plan  
- **3/7:** Finalize tasks in Optimal Workshop  
- **3/9 - 3/10:** ReOps review; Perigean touch base  
- **3/13:** Tree test launch (ongoing until recruitment target is me)
