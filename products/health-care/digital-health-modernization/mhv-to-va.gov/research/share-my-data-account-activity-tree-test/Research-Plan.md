# ‘Share My Health Data’ App and ‘Account Activity’ IA Research Plan | MHV on VA.gov  

## Background  
As My HealtheVet (MHV) transitions to VA.gov, integrating key features from MHV Classic, such as **Share My Health Data** and *Account Activity History*, requires a clear understanding of where authenticated users expect to find them. While these features support Veterans in managing their health data and tracking account activity, their placement within VA.gov has not yet been determined. Identifying where users naturally look for these tools will help ensure they are easily accessible and aligned with their expectations.

In MHV Classic, Veterans tracked health metrics through a self-reporting tool that required manual entry. The Office of Connected Care’s (OCC) Share My Health Data app expands on this functionality by enabling automatic synchronization with smart health devices, reducing the need for manual input and streamlining data sharing with VA care teams. For devices that are not compatible, users would still be able to manually log key health metrics, including blood pressure, heart rate, glucose, pulse oximetry, temperature, and weight.

Account Activity History is a legally mandated feature that provides authenticated MHV users with a record of their account activity, including who accessed their account, what information was viewed, any changes made, and the type of action performed. 

This study will identify where users naturally expect to find links to ‘Share My Health Data’ and ‘Account Activity History’ within MHV on VA.gov, ensuring they can efficiently access these tools to share healthcare metrics and monitor account activity. Findings will help inform decisions on site structure to support intuitive navigation and discoverability of these features.

## OCTO Priorities  
**Objective 1:** VA’s digital experiences are the easiest and most efficient way to access VA health care and benefits.  
**Key Result 1:** Improve satisfaction with our web and mobile products by 5 points.  

## Veteran Journey  
- Starting up  
- Taking care of myself  
- Putting down roots  
- Retiring  
- Aging  

## Research Goals  
The goal of this research is to determine where users intuitively expect to find links to ‘Share My Health Data’ and ‘Account Activity History’ MHV on VA.gov through task-based interactions in an unmoderated tree test.

## Outcome  
Findings from this research will determine where users intuitively expect to find links to ‘Share My Health Data’ and ‘Account Activity History,’ ensuring they can efficiently locate the tools needed to share their healthcare metrics and monitor their account activity within MHV on VA.gov.

## Research Questions  
- Where do MHV users expect to find **‘Share My Health Data’** within MHV on VA.gov?
- Where do MHV users expect to find **‘Account Activity History’** within MHV on VA.gov?
- How easily can users find the ‘Share My Health Data’ and ‘Account Activity History’ features within MHV on VA.gov, and what can their navigation patterns tell us about improving discoverability?
- Does the labeling of the ‘Account Activity History’ link align with users’ expectations, or would alternative terminology improve clarity and findability? (Note: ‘Share My Health Data’ is an official OCC app, and its labeling cannot be tested.)

## Hypotheses  
### **Share My Health Data Link**  
- Users will primarily expect to find **‘Share My Health Data’** within the **Health Records** section, as it logically aligns with personal health management.  
- Users familiar with MHV Classic may experience confusion if they expect to find a **‘Track Your Health’** or **‘Shared Vitals’** section instead.  

### **Account Activity History Link**  
- Users will **not** expect to find this link on the MHV landing page, as existing categories—Appointments, Messages, Medication, Records, Payments, and Medical Supplies—do not logically align with it.  
- Users familiar with MHV Classic will expect to find **‘Account Activity History’** under **‘Profile’**, mirroring past navigation patterns.  
- Users who perceive **‘Account Activity History’** as a security feature will look for it within **‘Profile’ → ‘Account Security’** options.  

## Methodology  
A tree test study will be conducted using Optimal Workshop (Treejack) to assess where MHV users expect to find links to ‘Share My Health Data’ and ‘Account Activity History’ features within VA.gov. Participants will complete task-based scenarios in an unmoderated study to evaluate their navigation patterns.

### **Location**  
- Unmoderated study via Optimal Workshop (Treejack).  

### **Recruitment**  
We will recruit **100 MHV users** through our recruitment partners, Perigean, based on the following criteria:  

**Group 1 (50 participants):**  
- Users who have experience using health data-sharing tools, such as manually inputting or sharing vitals on My HealtheVet.  
- Have accessed their account activity history at least once within the last six months.  

**Group 2 (50 participants):**  
- Users with no prior experience with health data sharing or account activity history.  
- Have been active MHV users within the last six months.  

### **Availability for Potential Kickoff Meeting Times with Perigean**  
- Monday, March 10: 9:00 AM - 2:00 PM (PST) 
- Tuesday, March 11: 9:00 AM - 2:00 PM (PST) 

### **Recruitment Approach**  
We are partnering with Perigean to recruit 100 Veterans for this tree test study, aiming to launch by March 13, 2025. The study will include active My HealthVet (MHV) users, divided into two groups: those who have previously shared or manually entered their health data and viewed their account activity history on MHV, and those who have not used either feature before. This approach ensures a balanced representation of user experiences to inform the optimal placement of these features within VA.gov.

### **Recruitment Criteria**  
**How many participants do you want in your study?**
100

**How many completed sessions do you need to consider your study complete?**
100

**Cohort Assignment**
Cohort 1: Must answer "Yes" to both Question 4 and Question 5.
Cohort 2: Must answer "No" to both Question 4 and Question 5.

**All participants must:**
- be Veterans
- receive VA healthcare benefits
- have an active My HealtheVet (MHV) account that they have accessed at least once in the past 12 months
- have a computer or tablet and be comfortable following written instructions to complete simple, lightweight tasks on their own (~15 min.)

**Cohort 1 (50 Veterans)**
Participants must have completed both of the following tasks at least once in the past 12 months:
- manually entered health vitals on My HealtheVet (e.g., blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature, weight, heart rate, pain level, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate)
- viewed their account activity history on My HealtheVet

**Cohort 2 (50 Veterans)**
Participants must not have experience with either of the following tasks in the past 12 months:
- manually entering health vitals on My HealtheVet.
- viewing their account activity history on My HealtheVet.

**Screener Questions:**
1. Do you currently receive VA healthcare benefits?
- a. Yes (Continue)
- b. No (Exclude)

2. Do you have a My HealtheVet (MHV) account?
- a. Yes (Continue)
- b. No (Exclude)

3. Have you accessed your My HealtheVet account at least once in the past 12 months?
- a. Yes (Continue)
- b. No (Exclude)

4. In the past 12 months, have you manually entered your health vitals on My HealtheVet?
(Examples include blood pressure, blood sugar, body temperature, weight, heart rate, pain level, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate.)
a. Yes (Proceed to Question 5)
b. No (Proceed to Question 6)

5. In the past 12 months, have you viewed your account activity history on My HealtheVet?
- a. Yes (Qualifies for Cohort 1)
- b. No (Proceed to Question 6)

6. If you answered “No” to both Questions 4 and 5, you qualify for Cohort 2.

**Contingency Plan for Recruitment:*
If, after two weeks, Perigean is unable to secure enough participants meeting the full criteria for Cohort 1 (i.e., experience with both manually entering health vitals and viewing account activity history), then recruitment should proceed with participants who have experience with at least one of these tasks

## Length of Sessions  
- Unmoderated  
- Aim for ~15 minutes per session

## Timeline  
- **3/6:** Finalize research plan  
- **3/7:** Submit recruitment request
