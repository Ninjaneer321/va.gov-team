# Report: Identified PII/PHI risk in Secure Messages IA components
This document contains notes around the identification of PII/PHI in Secure Messages by the Analytics team, the process of identifying specific code elements being passed into analytics that pose risks, and the response / mitigation plan. Later in this document, we include potential other risks in My HealtheVet and early suggestions for a potentially scalable alternative to title tags that may work for multiple products in the authenticated experience if further risks are identified. This is a living document and should be updated as needed.
