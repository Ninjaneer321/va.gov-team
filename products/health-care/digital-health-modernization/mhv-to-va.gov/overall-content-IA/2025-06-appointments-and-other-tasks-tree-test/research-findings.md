## Research goals

Questions have arisen around where to place several non-health-related tasks and pieces of information on VA.gov for caregivers and transitioning service members. This study specifically targets transitioning service members who are exiting or have recently exited the military and may need to access resources that don’t have an obvious location within the current VA.gov site architecture.

**Examples of tasks and information under consideration include:**
- Finding and scheduling appointments with a Solid Start representative, a program that connects transitioning service members with VA benefits and services
- Scheduling Compensation & Pension (C&P) exams for disability compensation and pension purposes
- Accessing denial letters, such as those related to denied community care appointments
- Locating education-related documents such as GI Bill benefit letters or checking the status of submitted applications

**Through this study, we aim to:**
- Understand where users expect to find important VA tools and information when completing tasks related to their benefits and service history
- Explore how users navigate scenarios such as scheduling a claim exam, managing dependents, checking a housing grant status, or downloading military exposure records
- Learn where transitioning service members look for support when first engaging with VA services, including tools like VA Solid Start and other non-medical resources
- Include participants who reflect the broader population of transitioning service members, with an estimated 58,000 potential users based on activity in the service-member hub (May 2025) and approximately 200,000 Veterans transitioning each year
- Use findings to improve how information is organized across VA.gov so these tools and resources are easier to find and use during a Veteran’s first year and beyond

## Research questions

1. You recently separated from the military. You were told to schedule a time to connect with a VA Solid Start program representative who can help you get started with the benefits and services VA offers. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
2. You received a letter from VA asking you to schedule a claim exam to evaluate the service-connected condition you reported as part of a claim. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
3. You recently submitted a request for care from a provider outside of VA and want to check the status of that request. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
4. You're applying for college, and the college needs your VA benefits information. You need to give VA permission to release your information to the college. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
5. You recently applied for a VA grant to make improvements to your home to better accommodate your needs related to a service-connected condition. You want to check the status of that application. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
6. You currently receive compensation for an injury you got during your military service. You want to add your child to your benefits to increase your payments. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
7. You need to download a copy of the record of toxic exposures you had during military service (called the individual longitudinal exposure record, or ILER) to support a VA benefit claim. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?

## Methodology

- We conducted two identical unmoderated tree tests using Optimal Workshop’s Treejack tool. The second test was launched separately after removing screener questions to improve participation following low response rates in the first round.
- Participants were asked to complete 7 tasks by navigating a menu structure and indicating where they would be able to find the answer.
- Tasks were randomized to avoid bias from learning the tree as the test progressed.
- Participants were not allowed to skip tasks.

## Key findings

1. Most Veterans were unable to locate where to schedule a call with a VA Solid Start representative. Many navigated to action-oriented sections such as Appointments, Find a Location, or Benefit Applications, suggesting they thought of the task as transactional rather than informational or program based.
2. Many Veterans did not interpret scheduling a claim exam as a standalone task. They looked in areas like Claims and Appeals, File a Claim, or Check Claim Status, indicating they saw it as a passive step within the broader claims process rather than something they needed to actively schedule.
3. Veterans often looked for the status of their community care request in familiar task-based tools like Secure Messages, Appointments, or their My VA and MHV portals rather than in the Community Care section, suggesting the task was likely to be a part of routine care management.
4. When asked to give a college permission to access their VA benefits, Veterans looked for ways to retrieve documentation rather than complete an authorization step. Many went to Education and Training, Benefit Letters, or Verify School Enrollment, suggesting they understood the task as finding proof of benefits and not giving formal consent or authorization.
5. When asked to check the status of a submitted housing grant application, more Veterans completed this task successfully than any other in the study, with many navigating to Claims and appeals, Benefit applications and forms, Housing assistance, or Disability → Manage benefits. However, some still went to areas like Benefit payments or My HealtheVet, suggesting lingering uncertainty about whether grant tracking is tied to health tools, financial info, or general benefits.
6. When asked how to add a child to their VA benefits, Veterans had difficulty identifying the correct path. While some succeeded by selecting Benefit payments or navigating through Disability to manage dependents, many chose paths like Benefit applications and forms, CHAMPVA, Caregiver support, or Pension, suggesting confusion around whether the action was related to family health coverage, new applications, or financial benefits.
7. When asked to download a toxic exposure record (ILER), several participants looked for it under Medical records, Claims and appeals, or Benefit applications and forms, suggesting confusion about whether ILER falls under health history, claims documentation, or application paperwork.

## Details of findings

### Finding 1: Veterans looked for broad benefit information instead of going directly to Solid Start
Participants looking for information about Solid Start gravitated toward broad benefit related sections, especially those focused on education, claims, applications, and payments. This suggests they were seeking general entry points related to post-service support, even if not directly connected to the Solid Start program. Only 35.4% of participants completed the task successfully.

### Finding 2: Veterans associated the exam with the claims process rather than a specific scheduling action
When asked where they would go to schedule a claim exam after receiving a letter from VA, many Veterans navigated to the “claims and appeals” section, suggesting they associated the exam with the broader claims process. Others explored areas related to health care, disability benefits, or medical records, indicating some uncertainty about where to complete the specific action. Just 37.5% of participants were able to get to the right place to complete the task.

### Finding 3: Veterans were unsure where to track requests for non-VA care
When asked where they would go to check the status of a care request from a provider outside of VA, participants often looked in secure messaging, general health care, or community care sections. This suggests uncertainty around where non-VA care requests are tracked. While some successfully navigated to appointments or care management, others relied on more familiar tools used for VA care communication or claims. In total, 37.5% of participants completed the task successfully.
