## Research goals

As the VA.gov ecosystem continues to grow, questions have come up about where to place certain tools and tasks that do not always have a clear home in the current site structure. This study focused on transitioning service members and explored how they navigate to find key information and tools across VA.gov during their first year after leaving the military. While many of the tasks were benefits related, some touched on health care as well. The goal was to better understand how Veterans approach both health and non-health topics and how they interpret the site’s information architecture when trying to get things done.

Veterans were asked to complete tasks based on common situations like:
- Connecting with a VA Solid Start representative  
- Scheduling a claim exam for disability compensation  
- Checking the status of a care request from a non-VA provider  
- Giving a school permission to access VA education benefits  
- Checking the status of a VA housing grant  
- Adding a child to VA benefits to increase compensation  
- Downloading military exposure records   

Through this research we aimed to:
- Learn where Veterans expect to find VA tools and information related to their benefits, health care, and service history.  
- Observe how Veterans approached common but sometimes ambiguous scenarios like managing dependents or tracking external care requests.  
- Identify moments of hesitation, missteps, or confidence in navigating VA.gov's current menu structure.  
- Use these insights to improve the way information is grouped and labeled on VA.gov so new Veterans can find what they need more easily.  

## Research questions

1. You recently separated from the military. You were told to schedule a time to connect with a VA Solid Start program representative who can help you get started with the benefits and services VA offers. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
2. You received a letter from VA asking you to schedule a claim exam to evaluate the service-connected condition you reported as part of a claim. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
3. You recently submitted a request for care from a provider outside of VA and want to check the status of that request. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
4. You're applying for college, and the college needs your VA benefits information. You need to give VA permission to release your information to the college. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
5. You recently applied for a VA grant to make improvements to your home to better accommodate your needs related to a service-connected condition. You want to check the status of that application. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
6. You currently receive compensation for an injury you got during your military service. You want to add your child to your benefits to increase your payments. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?
7. You need to download a copy of the record of toxic exposures you had during military service (called the individual longitudinal exposure record, or ILER) to support a VA benefit claim. Where in the list would you go to accomplish this task?

## Methodology

- We ran two identical unmoderated tree tests using Optimal Workshop’s Treejack tool.
- After low participation in the first round, we relaunched the second without screener questions to encourage more completions.
- Participants were asked to complete seven tasks by navigating a menu structure and selecting where they believed they would find the correct information.
- Tasks were randomized to avoid bias from learning the tree as the study progressed.
- Participants were not allowed to skip tasks.

## Limitations
This study included feedback from 48 participants, enough to spot patterns, but not enough to make strong statistical claims. Some tasks showed clear trends while others had more mixed results. Because this was an unmoderated tree test, we are only able to observe where participants clicked and not why they made those choices. Any takeaways should be considered directional and used to guide future testing or improvements rather than as definitive conclusions.

## Key findings

1. Most Veterans didn’t immediately recognize where to go to schedule a call with a Solid Start representative. Many navigated to more action-oriented areas like *Appointments*, *Find a Location*, or *Benefit Applications*, which suggests they thought of the task as something to book or apply for, rather than a program to learn about.
2. When asked to schedule a claim exam, many Veterans treated it as part of the broader claims process. They often explored sections like *Claims and Appeals*, *File a Claim*, or *Check Claim Status*, which shows they saw the exam as something that happens automatically and not something they would need to actively schedule themselves.
3. Veterans looking for the status of a community care request often turned to familiar tools like *Secure Messages*, *Appointments*, or their *My VA* or *MHV* portals. Some went to the *Community Care* section suggesting it's not clear where these kinds of external care actions live.
4. When asked to give a college permission to access their VA benefits, many participants went to *Education and Training*, *Benefit Letters*, or *Verify School Enrollment*. This shows they were thinking about finding documentation, not completing a formal authorization step.
5. Veterans checking the status of a housing grant had the highest success rate in the study. Most found their way to sections like *Claims and Appeals*, *Benefit Applications and Forms*, *Housing Assistance*, or *Disability → Manage Benefits*. A few looked in places like *Benefit Payments* or *My HealtheVet*, showing some lingering uncertainty about whether housing benefits are tied to financial tools or health care.
6. When trying to add a child to their VA benefits, many Veterans connected the task to compensation and explored areas like *Benefit Payments* or *Disability → Manage Dependents*. But a few also went to *Benefit Applications and Forms*, *CHAMPVA*, *Caregiver Support*, or *Pension* which suggests some confusion about whether the task is health related, financial, or part of a new application.
7. Veterans trying to download their toxic exposure record (ILER) usually looked in *Medical Records*, *Claims and Appeals*, or *Benefit Applications and Forms*. This shows they expected it to be tied to health history or claims, not stored under general records.

## Details of findings

### Veterans explored broad benefit sections when trying to connect with a Solid Start representative
Participants clicked into areas like Education, Claims, Applications, and Payments when asked where to go to schedule time with a Solid Start representative. These paths reflect an effort to locate post-military support, but not necessarily a direct connection to the Solid Start program itself. Only 35.4% completed the task successfully.

### Finding 2: Participants primarily selected Claims and Appeals when trying to schedule a claim exam
When asked where they would go to schedule a claim exam after receiving a letter from VA, many Veterans navigated to the “claims and appeals” section, suggesting they associated the exam with the broader claims process. Others explored areas related to health care, disability benefits, or medical records, indicating some uncertainty about where to complete the specific action. Just 37.5% of participants were able to get to the right place to complete the task.

### Finding 3:  Participants selected a wide range of paths when trying to check the status of a community care request
When asked where they would go to check the status of a care request from a provider outside of VA, participants selected a wide range of paths including Health Care, Secure Messages, Community Care, and Claims and Appeals. The variety of selections suggests it’s not clear where non-VA care activity is tracked in the current structure. While some successfully navigated to Appointments or care management-related areas, others relied on familiar tools typically used for managing benefits. Only 37.5% of participants completed the task successfully.

### Finding 4: Participants looked in Education and Training, but missed the correct path to authorize college access
When asked how they would give VA permission to release their benefits information to a college, many participants selected paths under Education and Training, including Verify Your School Enrollment, About GI Bill Benefits, Eligibility, and After You Apply. Some also selected Download Records, which is not part of the Education and Training section and did not lead to the correct location. While several participants landed in broadly relevant areas, most missed the specific path needed to complete the task. Only 20.8% of participants completed it successfully.

### Finding 5: Most Veterans successfully found where to check the status of a housing grant
When asked where they would go to check the status of a VA housing grant application, most participants navigated to paths that ended in pages like Claims and Appeals, Benefit Applications and Forms, or Check claim, decision review, or appeal status. These selections aligned with the intended destination and contributed to a 77.1% success rate. Few participants selected other unrelated areas, including Benefit Payments, Secure Messaging, Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA), and Medical Records.

### Finding 6: Veterans often looked in Benefit Applications and Family Support areas when trying to add a child for compensation
When asked how to add a child to their VA benefits to increase monthly compensation, many participants selected paths like Benefit Applications and Forms or sections under Family and Caregiver Benefits, including areas related to CHAMPVA and Survivor Benefits. These paths did not lead to the correct location. A smaller number of participants successfully navigated to Manage the dependents on your compensation under Disability or Benefit Payments under My VA. Only 33.3% of participants navigated to the correct destination.

### Finding 7: Veterans looked in Health and Claims paths when trying to download their Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER)
When asked where to download their Individual Longitudinal Exposure Record (ILER) to support a VA benefit claim, most participants selected paths under Health, Claims and Appeals, Benefit Applications and Forms, or other Disability-related sections. These choices might suggest participants associated the ILER with medical or claims information. Only 20.8 percent navigated to the correct path, Records under VA Benefits and Health Care.

## Recommendations
Even with a small sample, a few consistent patterns came through in how Veterans navigated and interpreted the site. Based on those behaviors, there are some initial areas to explore further:
- Clarify labels and pathways for tasks like adding dependents, checking non-VA care requests, and giving permission to share education benefits.  
- Reevaluate where tools like ILER or claim exam scheduling live especially if users expect them to be tied to health or claims.  
- Look at areas where users expected to find proof of something (like letters or records) but actually needed to take an action. This gap came up in more than one task.  
- Continue leaning into task based entry points especially for high-impact actions tied to compensation, housing, or post-military service support.

## Further research needed
This study offered meaningful insight into how transitioning Veterans move through VA.gov and MHV to approach common tasks. While the patterns we saw were useful, the sample size of just 48 participants wasn’t large enough to draw statistically confident conclusions. These findings should be seen as early signals and not final answers. A second round of research with a larger and more diverse group would help confirm what we saw and uncover anything we might have missed. As part of this effort, it may be helpful to work with the recruitment team at Perigean to strategize ways to reach more transitioning service members and Veterans who are not yet enrolled in VA health care or using VA.gov. Expanding Perigean’s recruitment database to include more of these individuals could also strengthen future research efforts across VA.gov and MHV.

### Who we talked to  
A total of 48 Veterans completed the study. All participants were either transitioning out of the military or had recently separated and were asked to complete a series of tasks based on common post-service needs. This group represents a small portion of the broader transitioning Veteran population. For context, an estimated 58,000 users engaged with the VA service-member hub in May 2025, and approximately 200,000 individuals transition out of military service each year.
