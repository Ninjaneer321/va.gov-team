# Research Goals & Questions
research_goals:
  - goal_1: "Validate improvements to Health Apartment information architecture based on Round 1 findings"

# Research Plan for [Team, Product, Date]

## Background
Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
- What problem is your product trying to solve?
- Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
- What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?

[Link to product brief](url goes here).

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Name

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions

Example tree test questions 


### Hypotheses
_Hypothesis 1:_ name 

_Hypthesis 2:_ name 

Etc.

## Method

### Unmoderated tree test
Explain why this method is best. Should relate to the type of research questions you're seeking to answer. Given the range of methods out there, why is an unmoderated tree test the best for getting your the information you need to move forward?  


### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Optimal Workshop. 

### Research materials
[Unmoderated tree test](set up and link)


## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information (whether the Veteran has used MyHealtheVet before; whether the Veteran uses VA healthcare) on a [folder on the sensitive repo](set up and link). 

## Recruitment criteria
We will schedule a total of 70 participants for a completion rate of 50 tree tests.  

|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.
