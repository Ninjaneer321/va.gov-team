# Product Outline: Medical Renewal Flow Via SM (VA.gov and VAHB)


#### Overview




## Outcome Summary



## Problem  (Update HERE)
**As a Veteran with Oracle Health facilities in my profile, I need to be able to find and select the care team when I send a new message, so that I can continue to manage my care and communicate with my providers.**




## Hypothesis (Update Here)
If we change the user flow for sending a new message then we expect it will be able to accommodate very different data structure for triage groups coming from Oracle Health, so that any user will be able to send a new message no matter what EHR their facility runs on.


### Assumptions/Risks (Update Here)

- We assume that the EHRM/Oracle Health recipient objects and messaging APIs operate as stated in production
- We assume there is no reliable way to get patient-to-recipient mappings for EHRM/Oracle Health recipient objects

### What we are building (Udpate Here)




### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)


#### Go-to-market 
- Internal communications to MHV Coordinators and help desk staff to ensure they are aware of how the feature works and can guide users who need help.
- External communication notifying patients at EHRM transitioned sites that they can now message their providers on VA.gov.
