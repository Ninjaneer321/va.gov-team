*Note: This section outlines a smaller feature that extends or enhances the overall product, building on what is described in our core [Secure Messaging on VA.gov Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/product). This is an adapted version of the [Initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md), pared down to match the smaller feature sizing. For definitions of products vs. features vs. initiatives, please see [Product Terms & Definitions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/product-operations-terms-and-definition).*
