This section is to house documentation for new features we are building that extend or enhance the overall product functionality, building on what is described in core Product Outline. We will host smaller-sized "feature outlines" here that can serve as a reference for stakeholder coordination, such as with Collaboration Cycle. These are features that can typically be worked within a quarter (or program increment) rather than a larger-sized initiative extending multiple quarters (e.g. plain language triage group enhancements to Select list).
