# Conversation Guide for Curated List Usability Testing

# Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! May I call you \[first name\]?

My name is \[name\]. I'm a researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.**â€¯I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**â€¯We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteransâ€™ needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.**â€¯This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be selectable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_\[If yes:â€¯\]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_\[If no:\]_ â€¯I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

_\[When observers are connected to audio, ask them to introduce themselves\]_

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?â€¯ We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- _\[If yes:â€¯\]_ Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

_\[Start recording.\]_

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Screen share/Remote share  - 2 minutes**

_\[If on Desktop/Laptop/Tablet:\]_â€¯I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get set up, I will give you instructions on what to do. â€¯_\[when ready\]_â€¯I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen and then you will be able to control my screen. Ready?

_\[If on mobile/tablet:â€¯\]_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom with your phone/tablet?

_\[If yes:â€¯\]_ I dropped the link to the prototype in the chat. Go ahead and pull it up and when you are ready to share, please do so.

_\[If no, follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)\]_

### **Participant Coaching**


Letâ€™s pause right here on this screen.

As you can see, this is not your My HealtheVet account. If you look in the top right corner where your name would appear, it says Jamie. Jamie is our test user and it is their account we will be using today.

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own.  

&nbsp; Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and canâ€™t see your screen. Does that make sense?

If you are ready, we can begin.â€¯

## Consent to use video clips

- I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
   - **If yes:** Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?
 
   <mark>**[Record answer here]**</mark>


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


# Emergency Exit ðŸš¨

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). <mark>**Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.**</mark>
