# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov, Secure Messages, June 2025 

## Background üèóÔ∏è
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) is being moved to VA.gov. 
	
`What problem is your product trying to solve?`

MHV provides Veterans with the ability to securely message and access previous messages with their healthcare teams.
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

Secure Messaging requires a Veteran to be authenticated.
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

Many Veterans are familiar with this tool as it was launched in November of 2023. With the passing of Milestones 1 and 2, there is an influx of Veterans using this product for the first time.

## Research Goals ü•Ö	
`What are you trying to learn from this research?` 

> [!NOTE]
> Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.

### Goals

### Research questions
> [!NOTE]
> Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the` [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)

***Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:***
	
`What will I do with what I learn from this question?`
  
`Does this question serve the goals of my study?`

**`1.`[Enter Q1]**

**`2.`[Enter Q2]**

**`3.`[Enter Q3]**

**`4.`[Enter Q4]**

**`5.`[Enter Q5]**

> [!TIP]
>Enter more questions as needed

### Hypotheses
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to constrain the hypotheses to the goals of your study!
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don‚Äôt skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

## Methodology  üõ†Ô∏è

We will be conducting moderated usability testing sessions in which we will ask users to navigate a prototype while we observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.‚ÄØ

- [ ] **In-person**

## Recruitment üéØ	


### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans.

### Recruitment criteria

- `Veterans:` **[12]**
- `Caregivers:` **[0]**
- `Dependents:` **[0]**
- `Total:` **[12]**
- `Ideal completed sessions:` **[10]**

### Primary criteria (must-haves)
*What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?* 

- `[Place primary criteria here between hash marks when in edit mode]`
- `primary criteria`
- `primary criteria`
- **`Add more criteria as needed`**

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
*What criteria would strengthen your results?* 

- `[Place secondary criteria here between hash marks when in edit mode]`
- `secondary criteria`
- `secondary criteria`
- **`Add more criteria as needed`**

## Timeline üóìÔ∏è
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[Enter dates and times MM/DD HH:MM]**

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Pilot participant name:` **[Enter name]**
- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[Enter time length]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[Enter buffer time]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[Enter NUM per day]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
