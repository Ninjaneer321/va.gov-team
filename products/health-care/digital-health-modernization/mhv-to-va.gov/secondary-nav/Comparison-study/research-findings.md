## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to assess and compare participants' ability to navigate the health portal using two distinct navigation concepts, both on mobile and desktop (total of 4 designs in all).

## Research Questions

* Are participants able to easily navigate to various tools within the My HealtheVet portal using the proposed secondary navigation designs?
* Can participants navigate to health-related tools that are not specifically named within the secondary navigation designs?
* How does a secondary navigation within the health portal impact participants' understanding of place within the VA.gov digital ecosystem?

## Methodology 

We conducted 16 remote interviews with Zoom. The 16 participants interacted with two prototypes each, half on desktop, half on mobile. 

## Key Findings

1. Earlier navigational behavior and outcomes​

2. Recurring navigational behaviors and outcomes: "gravitational pull" of wayfinding tactics​

3. Spectrum of "figure-it-outness"​

4. Sensemaking around health vs. Non-health resources: Differentiating between My VA and MHV portal experience

## Details of Findings 

**Finding 1: Earlier navigational behavior and outcomes​**

Participants who did not directly sign in had a more complex experience than those who did.  These early actions impact the rest of a participants’ experience.

**Finding 2: Recurring navigational behaviors and outcomes: "gravitational pull" of wayfinding tactics​**

We observed certain navigational tools exerting a “gravitational pull” on participants, in that participants would return to those comfortable tactics to accomplish their tasks, despite at times having wayfinding alternatives that would enable a more direct path.  The intended behavior embedded in the designs is for users to utilize the My VA and MHV landing page and, in the case of MHV, the secondary navigation within the MHV portal. When users used those strategies, they were more efficient at achieving their tasks. However, we observed a number of participants who returned throughout the course of their interviews to the Megamenu or Home page, or who referenced wanting to use Search functionality.

<img width="86" alt="image" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/129799592/f758f4c0-29d2-4f9e-a83e-407bc751259e">

Some participants would be in MHV portal experience and return to Megamenu, Home page or Search. They indicated that they did this because they believed that they could "restart" from those spaces. These participants commonly did not indicate an awareness of the MHV portal experience, or, at times, My VA, despite having navigated periodically in those experiences when seeking to accomplish those tasks. These participants had to follow circuitous routes to accomplish the tasks and often indicated frustration or described VA.gov as complicated or confusing. This lack of awareness of how to return to these personalized spaces or how to use these spaces to accomplish their tasks was most pronounced amongst participants using the mobile prototype. No participant using the mobile prototype looked for the tabs in the Authenticated Menu and as a result, did not locate the MHV landing page without support from facilitators. 


**Finding 3: Spectrum of "figure-it-outness"​**

**Finding 4: Sensemaking around health vs. Non-health resources: Differentiating between My VA and MHV portal experience**

*Finding #1:* One group of participants expressed that they want everything in one place.  These participants understood and used the links on My VA as a snapshot or gateway to start to access health care benefits, returning to where they started sometimes even when they were already in MHV.


> _“This [My VA] is like a snapshot of everything that would cover me...” – P13_

> _"I see it's [My VA] a jumping off place to for getting the rest of your VA stuff..." - P18_

*Finding #2:* Another group of participants distinguished their medical care from their other VA benefits.  At the start, for some this meant automatically MHV while others would guess at the Healthcare and Benefits megamenu.

> _“Normally I would think kind of like on the civilian side... I think of something like MyChart and so that would be my first instinct on the VA side, like, ok where do I find my like MyChart equivalent for VA?” – P23_

> _"I'm looking for something that says After Visit Summary... I think I would go to Benefits and Health care... then I would click on Health care... and then I would go over to Manage your health" - P16_

*Finding #3:* Participants' distinction between a snapshot of available VA benefits and one place to manage medical care required a greater recognition and awareness of the differences between the My VA and MHV pages writ large. Not all participants got there, and many never got there without help from the facilitator. Participants who did get there were more likely to be aware of the My VA than the MHV page, especially if they signed in and first landed on the My VA page.

> _“MHV is going to deal with your health... and then you have to go to My VA to get all your information about your other benefits...My VA is for everything else but MHV is just for your health.” – P8_

> _"...if it has anything to do with my health and wellbeing it's MHV app... anything else that's I think it's like a different app... like a copayment... it's going take you out of MHV" - P12_
