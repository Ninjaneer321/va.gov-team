## Important Context

### Past studies on wayfinding have uncovered: 

 * Users do not understand or experience My HealtheVet as a cohesive portal within VA.gov where they can complete all health-management related tasks.
 * As My HealtheVet on VA.gov is currently designed, most users expect to navigate the health portal using global navigation elements that direct them out of (not through) the portal
   * “Some participants would be in MHV portal experience and return to Megamenu, Home page or Search. [...] These participants had to follow circuitous routes to accomplish the tasks and often indicated frustration or described VA.gov as complicated or confusing.”
   * “Once users leave MHV for the broader site of VA.gov, it is very challenging and frustrating to find their way back”
 * 37% of My HealtheVet users are on mobile devices, which further exacerbates the experience of portal navigation; current examples of mobile secondary navigation menus are collapsed and appear to be missed by mobile users
 * This has led us to wonder:
   * How might we create a secondary menu that is easier to use than going back to the landing page to move from tool to tool?
   * How can we reduce the likelihood that users leave the health portal and get lost in the larger VA.gov ecosystem?
   * How can we more clearly define My HealtheVet as a well-labeled portal destination?

## Research Goals

 * Evaluate a new navigation strategy that prioritizes easy access to the four primary health  tools only. Determine whether this is successful at helping users find and complete most health-related tasks.
 * Design the navigation to deliver a dual purpose of offering users a strong “sense of place” for My HealtheVet, to clarify that it is a health portal within VA.gov.
 * Determine whether we have solved issues with collapsed navigation on mobile, or if Veterans require persistent, visible options to understand navigation. 

## Research Questions

 * Are participants able to easily navigate to various tools within the My HealtheVet portal using the proposed secondary navigation designs?
 * How easily can users navigate to the four primary health tools that are prioritized by the proposed designs? 
 * Can participants navigate to health-related tools that are not specifically named within the secondary navigation designs?
 * Is one design (Design A or Design B) more successful than the other at helping Veterans meet their needs?
 * How does a secondary navigation within the health portal impact participants' understanding of place within the VA.gov digital ecosystem?

## Methodology 

We conducted 16 remote interviews with Zoom. The 16 participants interacted with two prototypes each, either viewing both on mobile or both on desktop, half viewing Prototype A first, and the other half viewing Prototype B first.

## Key Findings

1. The persistent-link navigation strategy (on both versions of desktop and on mobile B) was successful in helping users accomplish tasks within the four primary health tools without leaving My HealtheVet.

2. Participants who started off with Mobile A went to the mega menu before finding the secondary nav.

3. The persistent link strategy also enhances participants' overall sense of place in the portal.

4. Participants that could not find what they were looking for within the four main tools did not necessarily think to go to the landing page.

5. Participants indicated that they do prefer a secondary nav that allows them to move seamlessly from tool to tool.

6. Participants were disoriented when they came into My HealtheVet through a side door (a deep-link to a specific message). Most participants expected to arrive at an intermediary page.

7. Familiarity with a landing page provides of sense of place that helps participants gain their bearing when they feel lost.

### Secondary Findings

8. 100% of users exposed to the abbreviations in mobile prototype B knew what the abbreviations meant.

9. Deep-linking participants into a tool's detail page revealed issues with current labeling.

10. My HealtheVet link text in the nav bar in prototype B (both desktop and mobile) is viewed as a label for the whole navigation bar, not a clickable link.

11. While participants did see "home " as clickable in both desktop and mobile prototypes A, they often did not think to go there unless they had seen the landing page before by clicking a breadcrumb (which was relatively rare).

12. For participants that did make it to the home page, locating the CPAP re-ordering link and/or the travel pay link was not a given.

## Details of Findings 

1. The persistent-link navigation strategy (on both versions of desktop and on mobile B) was successful in helping users accomplish tasks within the four primary health tools without leaving My HealtheVet.
 * While using a version of the secondary nav that offered persistent links, all 16 participants were able to stay within the portal and complete tasks 1 and 2, which asked them to locate tasks or information within Messages, Appointments, and Medical Records. 
   * P16: "The four major things that I'd use are right there."
   * P11: “"This is nice and easy. Much better than the current MyHealtheVet."
 * This is a strong departure from studies using other secondary navigation designs in which participants went to the mega menu first to navigate between pages within the health portal, a strategy that causes a frustrating, disorienting experience, ([Health Wayfinding Study - Jun 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/7f57cbccdb6a083c3281abd21e3fce0a5885a640/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-06-health-wayfinding-study), [My HealtheVet Secondary Nav Research, Oct 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-10-MHV-secondary-navigation-research)

2. Participants who started off with Mobile A went to the mega men before finding the secondary nav.
 * This behavior matches that seen in other secondary navigation studies, in which participants have a negative experience getting lost in VA.gov and return via circuitous routes, [My HealtheVet Secondary Nav Research, Oct 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-10-MHV-secondary-navigation-research)
 * Ultimately, it appears that participants used whichever navigation strategy stuck out to them the most (in other words, the most visually salient option).
 * **As a result all 8 participants that interacted with mobile versions of the prototypes found Mobile B to be an easier and/or more direct navigation strategy.**

3. The persistent link strategy also enhances participants' overall sense of place in the portal.
 * The prototypes differed from each other most in their mobile versions; mobile A showing a dropdown navigation that participants have to open to use and mobile B showing all links all the time. When using mobile A first, all participants responded to task 1 by going to the mega menu (a strategy we’ve seen in past studies). When using mobile B first, all participants started with the secondary nav within My HealtheVet.
 * The persistent link secondary nav helped participants change a known strategy that offers a poor UX and conflates the portal with the greater VA.gov website, in favor of a strategy that keeps them within the portal for health-management tasks, giving them a permeable container to navigate in, and navigate out of if they decide to.

4. Participants that could not find what they were looking for within the four main tools did not necessarily think to go to the landing page.
 * Across all devices and prototype designs, almost all participants repeatedly struggled with Task 3 in our study, which asked users where they would be able to re-order CPAP supplies or file for travel reimbursement (both requiring participants to find the landing page for the first time).
 * For example, 13/18 participants thought they’d find CPAP re-ordering under Medications. When we asked them where else they might look, participants were unsure and most went to the mega menu as their second option.
 * As more tools and features are added to the landing page, this problem is bound to grow unless we find creative ways to help participants go to or return to the landing page (outside of simply adding a link in the secondary nav).
 * More related to this in findings 10, 11, and 12

5. Participants indicated that they do prefer a secondary nav that allows them to move seamlessly from tool to tool.
 * While we recognize that it is possible for users to come to the portal to complete 1 task only, moving seamlessly between tools is a significant improvement in experience for those expecting to use more than 1 tool. 
   * P15: "In secure messaging, the way I do it now, or the way I have done it, in secure messaging, you're only in secure messaging. So then you have to exit secure messaging to get back to My HealtheVet where all the options are. So I like that I can just go straight from reading the email [message] and then okay, let me just go up here and click appointments. It's a lot more streamlined because it's right there. I don't have to go looking, okay now where do I find that again?"
   * P3: "I like that roaming bar that goes with you. I don't have to go backwards and forwards; I can just click on whatever I want; I can go from records to appointments to meds, and not have to go to a dropdown menu and scroll; there's also not as much scrolling."
 * Based on this study, we also posit that users will be encouraged to do more on My HealtheVet when they have a secondary nav that offers persistent links to the four main tools.

6. Participants were disoriented when they came into My HealtheVet through a side door (a deep-link to a specific message). Most participants expected to arrive at an intermediary page.
 * When explaining where they’d expect to land before the message screen, participants used the following words: dashboard, buffer, main landing page, menu, main hub, home screen, and home page.
 * This could be due to the way the study was set up, including  the design of the message detail page, that caused confusion when participants landed there (more in finding 9).

7. Familiarity with a landing page provides of sense of place that helps participants gain their bearing when they feel lost.
 * Multiple participants named returning “home” as an important strategy in getting their bearings if they’re feeling lost on a site. The landing page can act as a sign post that allows participants to better understand where they are, and a familiar place to return to when lost.
   * P15: “If I just can't find something or I get too far into like the menu tree, if I just click on that, it'll take me back to like a start page or homepage.”
   * P1: "I see it as a way to get back to the beginning. Like, if you get caught up in some stuff you're not sure where you are."  

## Secondary Findings

8. 100% of users exposed to the abbreviations in mobile prototype B knew what the abbreviations meant.
 * 12/12 participants correctly named the abbreviations and accurately identified what they would expect to fall under that tool
 * One participant took a moment to understand because he heard his screenreader say “APPS.” Once the abbreviation was spelled out to him, he immediately recognized it and knew what it meant.
 * We have already worked with accessibility to solve this issue; future iterations will be coded so that screenreader users hear the full word, “Appointments,” not “APPS.”

9. Deep-linking participants into a tool's detail page revealed issues with current labeling.
 * Currently, tool detail pages do not reference the name of the tool they fall under. For example, a specific secure message detail page has an H1 that is the title of the message. In our prototypes, the message was “X-ray results” which was confusing for participants. 
 * Under the H1, the four buttons were equally confusing. Because participants did not immediately understand that they were looking at a message similar to an email, links like “Move” or “Print” were seen as especially strange.

10. My HealtheVet link text in the nav bar in prototype B (both desktop and mobile) is viewed as a label for the whole navigation bar, not a clickable link.
   * P11: “I found it more confusing because I thought I was in My HealtheVet, so why would I be clicking on My HealtheVet? Did I go out of My HealtheVet?" 
   * P16: “Basically it’s  telling me the subject of what’s in that block.”

11. While participants did see "home " as clickable in both desktop and mobile prototypes A, they often did not think to go there unless they had seen the landing page before by clicking a breadcrumb (which was relatively rare)
   * P17: "That [task] was a little more difficult [...]. I'd have to know that I needed to go back to the main screen to [find CPAP].”

12. For participants that did make it to the home page, locating the CPAP re-ordering link and/or the travel pay link was not a given.
 * The Payments and Medical Supplies tasks have very low information scent throughout VA.gov. 
Within the portal, they are suppressed in more than one way: they’re not prioritized in the navigation, and they’re at the very bottom of the “home” landing page causing users to abandon scrolling before reaching the tools.
   * P16: "Most people are not gonna scroll down all the way because you're not thinking you'll see that stuff right there. That's just me."
   * P9: Seemed to accidentally hit breadcrumbs while talking to the moderator; scrolls around the landing page. Moderator again asks her where she’d look for CPAP re-ordering: “I’m still thinking Medications.”
 * This is problematic. The BTSSS Travel team just identified in a tree-testing study that the My HealtheVet landing page has the highest signal as a destination where VA.gov users expect to be able to file for travel pay, [Status Visibility IA Study, Jan 2024](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/084b74d92d44f3170ab53fc4e53c002b4b105918/products/health-care/beneficiary-travel/research/2024-01-Status%20Visibility%20IA%20Study)
