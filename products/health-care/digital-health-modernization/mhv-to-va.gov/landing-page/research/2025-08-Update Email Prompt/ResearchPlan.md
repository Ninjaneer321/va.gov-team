# Research Plan: Email update usability


## **Background**

As[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov) moves on to use VA Notify, users must have a contact email on file with VA.gov. If they do not, they will miss any notifications from[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov) about their healthcare. To avoid this,[ VA.gov](http://VA.gov) is prompting users to add, confirm or update their email address that is used for communication. This study will test that prompting process to evaluate if users understand what they need to do, why, and the potential consequences of their decisions.


### **OCTO Priorities**

Objective 1: Our digital experiences are the best way to access VA health care and benefits.



* Key Result 1: CSAT for our web products have increased by 5 points.


### **Veteran Journey**



1. Starting up
2. Taking care of myself
3. Putting down roots
4. Retiring


## **Research Goals**


### **Outcomes**

This research will allow the team to decide on the best path forward. Specifically, we will better understand if users can:



* Easily add, confirm or update their email address,
* Understand the purpose of these actions, and
* Understand the implications of their choices (e.g., skipping, confirming, updating).

The insights from this study will allow the UX team to adapt the appropriate content and messaging.


### **Research Questions**



1. Do users understand that they need to confirm, update or add their contact email address and why?
    1. Of the content presented, what confuses users?
2. Do users understand their options based on the question, understanding that those options will be different depending on the question?
3. Do users feel that they have the information they need to make an decision?
    2. Can users identify and articulate how this information will be used?
    3. Can users recognize the consequences of each option?
4. Do users understand how to advance?


## **Methodology**


### **Location**

Video interviews over Zoom. We will rotate the order in which tasks are asked of participants.


### **Research Materials**
