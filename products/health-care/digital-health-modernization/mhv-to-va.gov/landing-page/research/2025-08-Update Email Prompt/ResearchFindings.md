    Do users understand that they need to confirm, update or add their contact email address and why? Of the content presented, what confuses users?
    
    Participants assumed that if one part of the VA already had an email on file from them (for login, other reminders, etc) then everyone in the VA had that email on file. Yes, participants understood they were being asked to add, confirm or update a contact email address, but they didn't understand why they were being asked to do so because they assumed the VA already had this information.
    
    Examples:
    - "I would assume [contact email address means] emergency 'cause they already have my stuff, so yeah, I would assume emergency contact." - P1
    - "...Let's say you go do a FOIA or a privacy request and I think the form says, 'do you wish to receive electronic communication from the va?' So you have to put your email address on there. Ok so I've given that email address to the VA..." - P8
  - |
    Do users understand their options based on the question, understanding that those options will be different depending on the question?
    
    Yes, from an interaction standpoint, participants understood what their options were and how to execute on those options. One or two overlooked the "Skip for now and go on to VA.gov" link because their focus went to the bright blue buttons immediately.
    
    Examples:
    - "I would just add my email address in the contact email address box, and then hit save." - P6
    - "Confirm or update? So obviously the two choices are pretty, pretty simple, right? Confirm it. That's correct. The email address@email.com or update if I wanted to or if I wanted to actually skip it." - P8
    - "[If I clicked 'Skip for now'] It'd just take me to va.gov so I can start, but I'm sure it's gonna ask me again at some point. At some point it's going to be that little bug." - P8
  - |
    Do users feel that they have the information they need to make a decision? Can users identify and articulate how this information will be used?
    
    No, not clearly. But they do understand that if they do not add an email address that they might not get communications from the VA. There was not complete consensus about what kind of communications they might not receive.
    
    Examples:
    - "I'm really not sure [why I'm being asked to add a contact email] because all my information is in there, so I don't know why I would need to add it again when I know it's in there." - P6
    - "What I'm understanding is [if they don't provide an email] they will get none of their medical notifications… they won't be able to access their notes or maybe even fill prescriptions or diagnose..." - P3
  - |
    Can users recognize the consequences of each option?
    
    No, not clearly, because they assume the VA already has their email address because they have a VA.gov account. They assume that the VA would default to using what the VA has on file for other purposes. Participants also did not recognize that not providing their email could be an impediment to accessing the site.
    
    Examples:
    - "[If I skipped for now and went on to va.gov] I don't think anything would happen. I mean, they would take me to va.gov now. How would they contact me? By whatever's on file already." - P11
    - "I'm not sure, [what happens] if you don't update your information… I know that you won't be able to receive anything… any notifications from the VA." - P3
    - "[If I didn't enter or confirm I'd] probably I would have to go through a whole bunch of security questions and stuff like that." - P11
    
    Participants all noticed the bright yellow alert and understood they were seeing it as a consequence of not providing their email information. They knew what it was asking for and that it would not go away until they had done as prompted. Some said they would be annoyed by it.
    
    Examples:
    - "...because to me it's a forward arrow versus a X, right?… I think the only way you eventually get rid of it … is by updating the email, right, because it didn't have one on file, right...So you'd always have that annoying little yellow box sitting there." - P11
    - "[If I clicked 'Skip for now'] It'd just take me to va.gov so I can start, but I'm sure it's gonna ask me again at some point. At some point it's going to be that little bug." - P8
  - |
    Do users understand how to advance?
    
    From an interaction standpoint, they all understood how to advance/proceed. Almost all saw all of the options which were available for the different flows. One or two overlooked the "Skip for now and go on to VA.gov" link because their focus went to the bright blue buttons immediately.
    
    Examples:
    - "I would just add my email address in the contact email address box, and then hit save." - P6
    - "Confirm or update? So obviously the two choices are pretty, pretty simple, right? Confirm it. That's correct. The email address@email.com or update if I wanted to or if I wanted to actually skip it." - P8

# **Update Email Prompt Study**

Office of the CTO - Digital Experience (OCTO-DE), MHV on VA.gov and VAHB, Horizon team

Date: 08/28/2025

Contact Cara Frissell (cara.frissell@adhocteam.us) with questions.

Presentation deck used at "Design Review: MHV on VA.gov and VAHB" meeting on Wednesday, 10/1/25: [Update email prompt research study.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22660742/Update.email.prompt.research.study.pdf)

## **Research Goals**


### **Outcomes**

This research will allow the team to decide on the best path forward. Specifically, we will better understand if users can:



* Easily add, confirm or update their email address,
* Understand the purpose of these actions, and
* Understand the implications of their choices (e.g., skipping, confirming, updating).

The insights from this study will allow the UX team to adapt the appropriate content and messaging.


### **Research Questions**



1. Do users understand that they need to confirm, update or add their contact email address and why?
    1. Of the content presented, what confuses users?
2. Do users understand their options based on the question, understanding that those options will be different depending on the question?
3. Do users feel that they have the information they need to make an decision?
    2. Can users identify and articulate how this information will be used?
    3. Can users recognize the consequences of each option?
4. Do users understand how to advance?


## **Methodology**

8 30-minute interviews with Veterans over Zoom. Using a prototype, participants went throught two different flows (A and B).

## **Research Findings**

<strong><em>Do users understand that they need to confirm, update or add their contact email address and why?</em></strong>

<strong><em>Of the content presented, what confuses users?</em></strong>
<p>
Participants assumed that if one part of the VA already had an email on file from them (for login, other reminders, etc) then <em>everyone</em> in the VA had that email on file. Yes, participants understood that the interaction was asking them to confirm, update or add their email address.  They were less clear on <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> that email they were being asked to confirm/update/add would be used.  This blunts their understanding of the consequences of not doing the action. In particular, their belief that they had to have an email on file to even have an account on <a href="va.gov">va.gov</a> made them assume that means that the VA has an email for them - therefore, they did not understand why they were being asked to provide information that they had already provided multiple times. The distinction between the different types of emails - “contact email” versus login email etc. - wasn't immediately clear to participants.  However, they seemed to see this as a “low stakes” question and so said that they would do it.
</p>
<p>
<em>Examples</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“I would assume [contact email address means] emergency 'cause they already have my stuff, so yeah, I would assume emergency contact.” - P1</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>"...Let's say you go do a FOIA or a privacy request and I think the form says, ‘do you wish to receive electronic communication from the va?’ So you have to put your email address on there. Okay. So they can communicate with you electronically, but if you don’t have the email address then they won't be able to communicate electronically. I guess they would just have to mail it.” - P5 </em>
</p>

<strong><em>Do users understand their options based on the question, understanding that those options will be different depending on the question?</em></strong> 
<p>
Yes, from an interaction standpoint, participants understood what their options were and how to execute on those options.  One or two overlooked the “Skip for now and go on to <a href="http://VA.gov">VA.gov</a>”  link because they were on mobile devices and it was cut off on the screen and they didn't scroll down to see it.  
</p>
<p>
<em>Examples:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“I would just add my email address in the contact email address box, and then hit save.” - P6</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Confirm or update? So obviously the two choices are pretty, pretty simple, right? Confirm it. That's correct. The email address@email.com or update if I wanted to or if I wanted to actually skip it for now, I'll do it later…[if I skipped it] would probably just take me to the home page.” - P2</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>[If I clicked ‘Skip for now’] “It'd just take me to va.gov so I can start,  but I'm sure it's gonna ask me again at some point.  At some point it's going to be that little bug.” - P8</em>
</p>
<strong><em>Do users feel that they have the information they need to make a decision?</em></strong>

 
<strong><em>Can users identify and articulate how this information will be used?</em></strong>
<p>
No, not clearly.  But they do understand that if they do not add an email address that they might not get communications from the VA.  There was not complete consensus about what kind of communication would be sent to the email provided.  Most participants accurately described what a notification was, but some thought that not providing an email would block their ability to access their medical information online, not just notifications. See response to RQ1.  
</p>
<p>
<em>Examples:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“'I’m really not sure [why I’m being asked to add a contact email] because all my information is in there, so I don't know why I would need to add it again when I know it's in there.” - P6</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“What I'm understanding is [if they don’t provide an email] they will get none of their medical notifications… they won't be able to access their notes or maybe even fill prescriptions or different stuff like that if they were doing it … through the portal.” - P3</em>
</p> 
 
<strong><em>Can users recognize the consequences of each option?</em></strong>
<p>
No, not clearly, because they assume the VA already has their email address because they have a <a href="VA.gov">VA.gov</a> account.  They assume that the VA would default to using what the VA has on file for their <a href="VA.gov">VA.gov</a> account.  This was especially true when it came to confirming an email address as opposed to adding one. However, again, they knew there was a chance that if they did not provide the email information, it would interrupt communication from the VA.
</p>
<p>
<em>Examples:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>[If I skipped for now and went on to <a href="http://va.gov">va.gov</a>] “I don't think anything would happen. I mean, they would take me to va.gov now. How would they contact me? By whatever's in my profile right now.” - P10</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“I’m not sure, [what happens] if you don’t update your information… I know that you won’t be able to receive anything… any notifications from the VA.” - P3</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>[If I didn’t enter or confirm I’d] probably I would have to go through a whole bunch of security questions and stuff like that.” - P11</em>
</p>
<p>
Participants all noticed the bright yellow alert and understood they were seeing it as a consequence of not providing their email information.  They knew what it was asking for and that it would not go away until they completed the action of adding/confirming their email.  When asked, they noted the lack of an ‘x’ on the alert as a reason they could not get rid of the alert.  But they knew that they could ignore it by not engaging with it (scrolling down, going to another page, etc).  
</p>
<p>
<em>“...because to me it's a forward arrow versus a X, right?… I think the only way you eventually get rid of it … is by updating the email, right, because it didn't have one on file, right...So I think that it's gonna keep giving you that repetitively. So I don't wanna say like deal with it…like it's a nuisance, but…you have to take care of it at some point.” - P2</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>[If I clicked ‘Skip for now’] “It'd just take me to va.gov so I can start,  but I'm sure it's gonna ask me again at some point.  At some point it's going to be that little bug.” - P8</em>
</p>

<strong><em>Do users understand how to advance?</em></strong>
<p>
From an interaction standpoint, they all understood how to advance/proceed. Almost all saw all of the options which were available for the different flows. One or two overlooked the “Skip for now and go on to <a href="http://VA.gov">VA.gov</a>”  link because they were on mobile devices and it was cut off on the screen and they didn't scroll down to see it.  
</p>
<p>
<em>Examples:</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“I would just add my email address in the contact email address box, and then hit save.” - P6</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>“Confirm or update? So obviously the two choices are pretty, pretty simple, right? Confirm it. That's correct. The email address@email.com or update if I wanted to or if I wanted to actually skip it for now, I'll do it later…[if I skipped it] would probably just take me to the home page.” - P2</em>
