## **Research Goals**


### **Outcomes**

This research will allow the team to decide on the best path forward. Specifically, we will better understand if users can:



* Easily add, confirm or update their email address,
* Understand the purpose of these actions, and
* Understand the implications of their choices (e.g., skipping, confirming, updating).

The insights from this study will allow the UX team to adapt the appropriate content and messaging.


### **Research Questions**



1. Do users understand that they need to confirm, update or add their contact email address and why?
    1. Of the content presented, what confuses users?
2. Do users understand their options based on the question, understanding that those options will be different depending on the question?
3. Do users feel that they have the information they need to make an decision?
    2. Can users identify and articulate how this information will be used?
    3. Can users recognize the consequences of each option?
4. Do users understand how to advance?
