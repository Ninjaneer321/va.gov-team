# Gap analysis research on the My HealtheVet home landing page
Date: July 2024

## Background and problem statement
On June 17, 2024, the My HealtheVet portal teams launched a large number of features into production that for the first time "integrate" the My HealtheVet experience onto VA.gov. Tools that were previously available, but siloed off as islands, are now more broadly available and can be seamlessly accessed through a secondary navigation bar. The Cartography team has since been working on maturing our analytics monitoring of the transition effort since the launch.

In July 2024, OCTO health leadership prioritized a "stay steady" approach, calling for UX efforts to focus on monitoring the current state and making design iterations only when user-identified pain points emerge in feedback. Alongside the monitoring effort, **our team saw value in conducting desk research to evaluate any potential gaps that may exist between the current state of the landing page, and what we know Veterans want and/or likely expect.**

## What is a "gap"?
We define a gap as the space between where we are now, and where we need to be in order to meet Veteran and business needs. 

## Gap areas being analyzed
We posit that some unmet Veteran and/or business needs might be identified by looking into potential gaps between the My HealtheVet home page (current state) and what we see in these other forms of research:  
1. Previously conducted research at the VA
2. Qualitative Medallia feedback that has been captured from Veterans
3. Market research (competitive analysis into other authenticated portals)

### 1. Previously conducted research at the VA
This research looked at previously conducted studies at the VA - some specific to earlier health portal generative research, broader healthcare benefit related research, and some broader research and artifacts that are adjacent to health work and outcomes. Those studies include:

**Health research:**
* Digital Health Modernization generative research - 2020
* Digital Health Modernization strategy - 2017
* Preferred Health Facilities research - 2021
* 10-10EZ Toxic Exposure Questions Usability Study (10-10 Health Apps Team) - 2024

**Other Veteran research and artifacts:**
* VA.gov home page top tasks research (Public Websites Team) - 2022
* Personalized home screen evaluative research (VAHB Mobile App Team) - 2024
* Generative research on Transitioning Service Members (Authenticated Experience Team) - 2024
* VA.gov home page user research (Public Websites Team) - 2023
* Authenticated user generative research (Authenticated Experience Team) - 2020
* Caregiver Journey Map
* Building trust with women Veterans journey map

**Related desk research:**
* Personalization Competitive Analysis (VAHB Mobile App Team) - 2023
* Review of related user research: VA mobile app personalization (VAHB Mobile App Team) - 2022
* MyVA Design research - 2020

### 2. Qualitative Medallia feedback 
We combed through 

### 3. Market research / competitive analysis
