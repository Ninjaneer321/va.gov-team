# Gap analysis research on the My HealtheVet home landing page

## Background and problem statement
On June 17, 2024, the My HealtheVet portal teams launched a large number of features into production that for the first time "integrate" the My HealtheVet experience onto VA.gov. Tools that were previously available, but siloed off as islands, are now more broadly available and can be seamlessly accessed through a secondary navigation bar. 

The Cartography team has since been working on analytics monitoring of the transition effort to this first step toward integration onto VA.gov. We are juggling the VA's migration to GA4 in the same timeframe as well as ramping up on learning and investing in DataDog for monitoring.

In July 2024, OCTO prioritized monitoring the current page and making very few iterations to the page, and our goal is to measure the extent to which this landing page is "successful" or not. By which we mean, is it meeting Veteran needs and expectations for a health portal hosted on VA.gov? An analytics evaluation plan is being drafted to get at better answering that question. But alongside that effort, we also conducted desk research to evaluate any potential gaps that may exist between the current state of the landing page, and what we already know Veterans likely expect. 

## What is a "gap"?
We define a gap as the space between where we are now, and where we need to be in order to meet Veteran and business needs. 

## Gaps being analyzed
We posit that some unmet Veteran and/or business needs might be identified by looking into potential gaps in these areas: 
* Current state My HealtheVet home page vs. previously conducted generative research at the VA.
* Current state My HealtheVet home page vs. qualitative Medallia feedback that has been captured from Veterans.
* Current state My HealtheVet home page vs. market research (competitive analysis into other authenticated portals).
