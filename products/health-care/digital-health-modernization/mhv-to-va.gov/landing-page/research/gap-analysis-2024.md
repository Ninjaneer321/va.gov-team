# Gap analysis research on the My HealtheVet home landing page
Date: July 2024

## Background and problem statement
On June 17, 2024, the My HealtheVet portal teams launched a large number of features into production that for the first time "integrate" the My HealtheVet experience onto VA.gov. Tools that were previously available, but siloed off as islands, are now more broadly available and can be seamlessly accessed through a secondary navigation bar. The Cartography team has since been working on maturing our analytics monitoring of the transition effort since the launch.

In July 2024, OCTO prioritized a "stay steady" approach, focusing UX efforts on our team on monitoring the current state and only making design udpates when user-identified pain points emerge. Alongside the monitoring effort, our team saw value in conducting desk research to evaluate any potential gaps that may exist between the current state of the landing page, and what we know Veterans want and/or likely expect.

## What is a "gap"?
We define a gap as the space between where we are now, and where we need to be in order to meet Veteran and business needs. 

## Gap areas being analyzed
We posit that some unmet Veteran and/or business needs might be identified by looking into potential gaps between the My HealtheVet home page (current state) and what we see in these other forms of research:  
1. Previously conducted generative research at the VA
2. Qualitative Medallia feedback that has been captured from Veterans
3. Market research (competitive analysis into other authenticated portals)

### 1. Previously conducted generative research at the VA

### 2. Qualitative Medallia feedback 

### 3. Market research / competitive analysis
