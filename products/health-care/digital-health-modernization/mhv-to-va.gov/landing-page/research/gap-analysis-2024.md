# Gap analysis research on the My HealtheVet home landing page
Date: July 2024

## Background and problem statement
On June 17, 2024, the My HealtheVet portal teams launched a large number of features into production that for the first time "integrate" the My HealtheVet experience onto VA.gov. Tools that were previously available, but siloed off as islands, are now more broadly available and can be seamlessly accessed through a secondary navigation bar. The Cartography team has since been working on maturing our analytics monitoring of the transition effort since the launch.

In July 2024, OCTO health leadership prioritized a "stay steady" approach, calling for UX efforts to focus on monitoring the current state and making design iterations only when user-identified pain points emerge in feedback. Alongside the monitoring effort, **our team saw value in conducting desk research to evaluate any potential gaps that may exist between the current state of the landing page, and what we know Veterans want and/or likely expect.**

## <a name="gap"></a>What is a "gap"?<br>
We define a gap as the space between where we are now, and where we need to be in order to meet Veteran and business needs. 

## <a name="gaps-analyzed"></a>Gap areas being analyzed<br>
We posit that some unmet Veteran and/or business needs might be identified by looking into potential gaps between the My HealtheVet home page (current state) and what we see in these other forms of research:  
1. Previously conducted research at the VA
2. Qualitative Medallia feedback that has been captured from Veterans
3. Market research (competitive analysis into other authenticated portals)

### <a name="va-research"></a>1. Previously conducted research at VA<br>
This research looked at previously conducted studies at the VA - some specific to earlier health portal generative research, broader healthcare benefit related research, and some broader research and artifacts that are adjacent to health work and outcomes. Those studies include:

#### Themes/Trends: 

#### Gaps identified: 


### <a name="medallia"></a>2. Qualitative Medallia feedback<br>
We closely evaluated qualitative feedback from two surveys: A11 and Intercept that have been collected since the integration launch date of 6/17/2024. Feedback was sorted based on overall sentiment in these three categories: 
* Positive feedback
* Negative feedback 
* "I want" feedback

#### Gaps identified:
So far, analysis suggests that these features might add value to Veterans on the My HealtheVet home landing page:
* Wants to update address on VA.gov
* Wants to find account number on VA.gov 

### <a name="competitive-analysis"></a>3. Analogous market research / Competitive analysis<br>
Following the rules of Jakob's Law, we assume that Veterans prefer My HealtheVet on VA.gov to work the same way as all the other similar sites they already know. We did competitive analysis research into other authenticated portals across several domains: health, insurance, pharmacy, finance, etc. Images and notes about this analysis are captured here. 

**Competitive Analysis Rubric:** 
Evaluated the solutions that competitors bring to the same problems we attempt to solve on the current state of the My HealtheVet home page, which are expanded upon in [this related document](), but at a high-level include: 
* Findability/navigation
* Education
* Help
* Branding and "sense of place" (did not evaluate as this is a unique problem for My HealtheVet on VA.gov, which is a portal within another website)
* Communication and user control

| Company | Market type | Navigation | Education | Help | Communication | User control | Other |
