# My HealtheVet Landing Page Post-Secondary Navigation Medallia feedback 

This document is intended to analyze user feedback (Medallia) and track trends post secondary navigation launch/integration on 6/17/25. We seek to better understand how Veterans are responding to the portal and identify areas that are successful or need improvement. 

The Cartographer Team will request landing page responses (/my-health/) as tool teams will also be pulling responses daily. 

- Medallia qualitative feedback is to be analyzed daily and will be stored (get sharepoint link) 
- C-SAT will be calculated biweekly 

Medallia feedback on My HealtheVet is collected via two distinct surveys: 

* A11 "Intercept" survey - launches a modal window inviting users to take the survey; it intercepts 5% of sessions where the user visits 3 or more pages.
* VFS "Feedback button" survey - used to collect user feedback for specific Veteran Facing Services; it is accessed by a floating feedback button on the right-hand side of specific URLs. Access to this survey is persistent and is more likely to be sought by Veterans who are experiencing a pain point online.

## Details: A11 Intercept survey

* Key c-sat score name: "VA.gov experience"
  * Calculated by combining counts of high scores (4 & 5s) against the total number of responses (i.e. 32 high scores /64 responses = 50% CSAT)
* Delivery: Intercept modal (randomly offered to a small percentage of users; appears in report for URL where modal appeared)
* Customer scoring rubric: respondents score their overall experience on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is high.


## Details - VFS Feedback Button survey

* Key c-sat score name: "What is your overall satisfaction with this site?"
* Delivery: Feedback button at bottom of page
* Customer scoring rubric: respondents score their overall experience on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is high.
