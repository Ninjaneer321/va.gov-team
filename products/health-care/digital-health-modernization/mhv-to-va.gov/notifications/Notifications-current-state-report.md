# My HealtheVet Notifications: Current State Report
This report documents what we know and understand about notifications that route users to the My HealtheVet on VA.gov health portal from outside sources (email, push-notifications on mobile devices). This report DOES NOT document passive in-app notifications that are generated on VA.gov itself, but seeks to inform a future-state where we build out an in-app notification ecosystem that will hopefully scaffold on top of the existing external notifications that already exist. Understanding the current state will help us determine several things that are crucial for scaling a system that makes sense to Veterans and is consistent with other types of communication they already receive: 
* What notifications do users already get via email for each health tool?
* What notifications do users already get via push-notification (mobiel device) for each health tool?
* What notifiations are opt-in (via Profile) and which are automatic?
* What content or language do we use in those notifications today?
* What hyperlinks, buttons, or CTAs are in those notifications? And where exactly do they route users?
