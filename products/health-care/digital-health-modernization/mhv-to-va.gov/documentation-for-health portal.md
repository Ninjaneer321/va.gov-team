## <a name="background"></a>Background of the My HealtheVet transition<be>

1.  **What are the most consistent health-related navigational pain points (health specific)?**
    * What are the common issues or frustrations Veterans face when trying to find or use health-related tools and information on MHV?
2. **What are the highest impact navigation-related pain points (General/all of VA?)**
    * What navigation problems that cause the biggest challenges or make it hardest for Veterans to accomplish their tasks?
3. **How do behaviors differ (or don’t) in the health space compared with the benefits space (health/ general all of VA)?**
    * Do Veterans use My HealtheVet (health) differently than they use VA.gov for benefits? If so, how? If not, what’s the same?
4. **What do Veterans expect from an authenticated experience on VA.gov that includes benefits from a range of VA sub-agencies? (general/all of VA)**
    * What do Veterans want or expect when they log in to VA.gov, especially when it comes to easily accessing benefits and services from different VA departments (like health care, education, or disability)?
5. **What are the use cases where there’s overlap between health and other areas, where people might not find what they need in the health space? (Health/general all of VA)**
    * When do Veterans’ needs for health-related tools or information cross over into other areas (like benefits or education), and where does this overlap cause confusion or make it hard for them to find what they need?
