**Overview**

The My HealtheVet (MHV) project is part of the Health Modernization Initiative at the VA, operating within the Office of the CTO (OCTO). 

The My HealtheVet on VA.gov team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov, mirgating from [My HealtheVet classic](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home). 

Research from 2018, repeated in late 2020, shows that Veterans find it difficult to navigate commonplace interactions with VA health care. The VA ecosystem is so complex that veterans feel discouraged from applying for, managing, and maximizing their benefits.

While the team’s core responsibility focuses on the MHV landing page and Secondary Navigation, close collaboration with other teams ensures that Veterans have a seamless experience managing their healthcare in a single place.

The MHV to VA.gov initiative consists of several different products, each with its discrete product outlines and teams:

  - [MHV on VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product/product-brief.md) (overall initiative) 
  - [Secure Messaging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/product)
  - [Medical Records](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/README.md)
  - [Medications](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medications/README.md)

In September 2023, the My HealtheVet on VA.gov landing page was launched ([see more about the landing page here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/landing-page)). 

Using a phased approach, teams have systematically integrated the four major health tools — [Appointments](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling), medications [Medications](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medications/README.md), [Secure Messaging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secure-messaging/product), and [Medical Records](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/README.md) — into My HealtheVet on VA.gov. An "opt-in" experience in production allowed Veterans to access these tools on VA.gov while enabling teams to monitor usage, validate performance, and continuously refine the experience. 

On June 2024, the [Secondary Navigation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/secondary-nav/README.md) was launched to enhance Veterans' awareness and navigation of health tools available within My HealtheVet on VA.gov. This improvement aims to reduce the likelihood of Veterans searching for healthcare-related tools in unauthenticated areas of VA.gov, such as the megamenu.

As of December 2025, all four of the essential health tools are now fully available on VA.gov.
