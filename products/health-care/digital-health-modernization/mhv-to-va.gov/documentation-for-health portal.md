**Overview**

The My HealtheVet (MHV) project is part of the Health Modernization Initiative at the VA, operating within the Office of the CTO (OCTO). The My HealtheVet on VA.gov team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov, mirgating from [My HealtheVet classic](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/home). 

Research from 2018, repeated in late 2020, shows that Veterans find it difficult to navigate commonplace interactions with VA health care. The VA ecosystem is so complex that veterans feel discouraged from applying for, managing, and maximizing their benefits.

While the team’s core responsibility focuses on the MHV landing page, close collaboration with other teams ensures Veterans have a seamless experience managing their healthcare in a single place.

## <a name="existingfeatures"></a>Where are we now? - Existing features<be>

Utilizing a phased approach, we have validated and iterated on My HealtheVet on VA.gov to ensure that it meets the needs of Veterans and caregivers. All major health tools (appointments, medications, secure messaging, and medical records) are now available on VA.gov. 

 goal is to encourage more Veterans to make the new MHV experience on VA.gov their primary portal and retire the duplicate portal experiences that cause Veteran confusion.
