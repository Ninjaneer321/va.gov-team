# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov Usability Round 1
February - March, 2022

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, MyHealtheVet (MHV) will be replatformed to VA.gov. We developed a prototype of what MHV on VA.gov could look like, which we are testing as part of this research. This study will build off of the results of our [informal user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-guerilla-test-12-2021/2021-12-guerilla-research-report.pdf), conducted in December 2021. 

You can read more about our Digital Health Modernization strategy [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product).

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following objectives:
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	
The goals of this study are to:
- determine if Veterans understand the concept of MHV on VA.gov as their "health apartment" 
- identify major usability or content issues with the current concept of MHV on VA.gov


### Outcome
Results of this study will help us determine if our proof of concept is headed in the right direction, and if there are any big usability concerns that Veterans experience with the designs. This will inform later iterations of the design as we move into a MVP stage of the product.

### Research questions
This research will help us answer:
- Will Veterans understand the concept of the health apartment as shown in this design? 
- How would Veterans expect to get to the health apartment?
- What would they expect to see in their health apartment if they were logged in? Not logged in?
- Will Veterans be able to accomplish the main health tasks related to appointments, secure messaging, pharmacy, and medical records with this design?
- What is the Veteran perception of how the health apartment would fit into how they manage their health at the VA?

### Hypothesis
- Veterans will easily understand the idea of a centralized place where they can access their VA medical information
- Veterans will expect a personalized experience if logged in, such as their specific prescriptions, appointments, or information relevant to their care
- Veterans will be able to accomplish a variety of health tasks as designed in this prototype

## Method	
We use conduct remote moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research is focused on the laptop/desktop experience. Future rounds of research will explore mobile versions of the prototype.


### Location
This research will be remote via Zoom. 

### Research materials 
- [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/Round1_Usability/conversation_guide.md)

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
The audience is Veterans with and without VA healthcare, to be recruited by Perigean.
