#10-7959c CHAMPVA Other Health Insurance (OHI) Certification
---

## Overview
The CHAMPVA Other Health Insurance certification is required for the CHAMPVA application if the user has Medicare or any outside health insurance. The standalone form is also used to update information if there are changes to insurance while enrolled in CHAMPVA.

This effort is to digitize the form so that applicants to CHAMPVA also have a digital service for providing their Other Health Insurance certification. Currently, the burden around form 10-7959c lies with applicants who often have to fill out the paper form multiple times, and as well as with thoee who receive the paper forms and then scan them for entry into other systems. Our goal is to reduce the load in the mailroom and subsequently improve the experience and processing time for the applicant.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Digital form submission so that applicants no longer have to mail in multiple copies of the paper form.
- Bypassing the mailroom to reduce the processing backlog and intake burden.

## Additional Efforts
- Combine the OHI form with the 10-10d application form to allow users to fill out both at the same time.
