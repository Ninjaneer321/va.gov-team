## 10-7959c Questions 

|Number|Complete?|Form Section|Question|Blocking Testing?|Blocking for Production (1=must)|Answer|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|NEW|10-7959c|If a third party (or anyone other than an applicant on the form) is filling this form out do we need to collect their contact info?||||
|2|NEW|10-7959c|Will Name DOB and SSN be enough info to identify a person so PA can add info to their “file”?||||
|3|NEW|10-7959c|(Recommendation)To avoid asking redundant questions, causing confusion or displaying overlapping information during the overall experience of enrolling in CHAMPVA (with OHI) we should consolidate the 1010D and 7959c forms. We will still have a standalone 7959c form to capture any coverage/ address updates. How may we solve this problem to best accommodate the PRA? Can we give 2 control numbers on the intro page if we consolidate.|||Talk to CAIA|
|4|NEW|10-7959c|The new launch of the digital 1010D form ChampVA enrollment and OHI form are going to come in within the same workflow (unless applicants choose to mail in their cards/ 7959c form). If we plan to pull out the 7959c info from the 1010d to keep it separate, how would that work on the backend now having this info coming in at two separate times? Will that add to the admin side of things? (How does that effect the existing process?)||||
|5|NEW|10-7959c|Can we have multiple applicants on the same form submission?|||improve front end, same output on back end (separate PDFs per applicant)||||

Recommendation: Consolidate 10-10d and 10-7959c forms. Build a standalone form to capture coverage/address updates.
