|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|NEW|If a third party (or anyone other than an applicant on the form) is filling this form out do we need to collect their contact info?||||Requires whoever is filling it out, to sign/date/phone number/city/state and zip - contact info yes|
|2|NEW|Will Name DOB and SSN be enough info to identify a person so PA can add info to their “file”?|||yes|
|3|NEW|What is the current process for 10-7959c? The new launch of the digital 1010D form ChampVA enrollment and OHI form are going to come in within the same workflow (unless applicants choose to mail in their cards/ 7959c form). If we plan to pull out the 7959c info from the 1010d to keep it separate, is there an impact to having info coming in at two separate times?|||If they don't have any OHI and mark no, we don't require them to fill out 7959 bec they have no other health insurance - we use that. If we take that out, we'd have to take them to the OHI form. Thinking about long term - want to remove OHI form from application process - that has nothing to eligibility - more about payment. Can delay current process. Would like to remove OHI from process and move it to claims payment process part of house - when they go to collect payment. Do need it for current state. Trying to move to future state.|
