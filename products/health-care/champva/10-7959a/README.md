# 10-7959a CHAMPVA Claim Form

## Overview
For Veterans and beneficiaries enrolled in CHAMPVA (Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs), filing a claim online (form 10-7959a) follows the digitization of enrollment (form 10-10d) and Other Health Insurance certification (form 10-7959c). Veterans and their beneficiaries need a way to file claims through CHAMPVA quickly and easily, so they can get coverage for the services they need.
 
## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans are able to fill out the claim form online on VA.gov
- Veterans spend less time, effort and money filling out and mailing paperwork
- Veterans spend less time spent waiting to hear back on the status of their claims
