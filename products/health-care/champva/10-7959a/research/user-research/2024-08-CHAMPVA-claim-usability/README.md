## Background
This study supports the unauthenticated digital flow for form 10-7959a claims form for the CHAMPVA program. We will be building this as a new digital form, so there will be no familiarity from the perspective of the Veterans and dependents interacting with the digital version. However, we will specifically attempt to recruit participants who are familiar with the paper form and program.

## Research Goals
* Test the usability of the current iteration of the 10-7959a prototype.
* Test high-level accessibility for the current iteration of the 10-7959a prototype.
* Extract insights about the participantsâ€™ experience with the current CHAMPVA and the current CHAMPVA claims (10-7959a) process. This will inform artifacts and build evidence to address pain points discovered during stakeholder interviews and support continued service design efforts.
