|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|No|Patient Info|What happens when the beneficiary checks the “new address” box?|Yes|Yes||
|2|No|OHI|If beneficiaries need to provide all their OHI information in order to be accepted into CHAMPVA, what are the benefits of gathering this information on the during the claims process? Is it just to check for updates in their OHI?  Do they need to enter it again if they’re logged into their account?|Yes|Yes|They are checking to make sure that they still have the same OHI or if they dropped it. (basically the same as the 7959c for updates). They will immediately update the insurance with the correct info on the CHAMPVA side. If CHAMPVA notices a difference in the billing/OHI the voucher examiners will investigate or update. They can send out an OHI cert for the patient to fill out so they can update it. Cannot pull any CHAMPVA info in to the form .||
|3|No|OHI|What are the differences and goals for each of these two questions?: <br>“Was treatment for a work-related injury/condition?” Y/N<br>“Was treatment for an injury or accident outside of work?” Y/N|Yes|Yes|1 is covering workmen's comp and 2 is for auto accident or is someone else is liable (if it was a car accident) vs personal injuries. CHAMPVA wants the workman’s comp group to pay for the thing instead of CHAMPVA paying for it. If they have other health or car insurance insurance they’d want them to pay for it instead of CHAMPVA. In either circumstance, it probably needs to go to TPL (third party liability), we still process and pay, but down the road someone else is responsible to pay eventually. The question is phrased this way to prevent applicants from submitting specific documents related to insurance coverage, etc.|
|4|No|OHI|What are the implications of the treatment being work-related or not? Does military service count as work in this scenario? What if it was military-service related, does that change anything?|Yes|Yes|If they’re in the military service they’d qualify for TRICARE, not CHAMPVA|
|5|No|Submission|If beneficiaries decide to submit this PDF online and then mail in their other documents, would they need to print out the PDF as the cover sheet anyways then? Or what type of additional information would they need to provide when mailing in their claims if they submit the PDF online?|Yes|Yes|If they mail a doc – in current state- it'll go to them in mailing then they’ll tie it to the applicant's claims/enrollment but they in the Sponsor's SSN on the mailed document somewhere. It's a manual on their end to recieve the mail and place it in their account. No cover sheet needed.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|No|Patient Info|Are the CHAMPVA Member Numbers always the same as the patient’s SSN? If so, then what’s the reason they are viewed separately|Yes|Yes|It's the same as SSN but in the future it may change. Maybe able to have hint text explain it may be the same as SSN

|2|No|General|Are there any requirements around the EOB? (e.g. certain pieces of information that need to be included)<br>Is there a way we could store this information so the users don’t have to re-upload it every time?|Yes|Yes|We require the Explanation of benefits from OHI to match the claim submitted. They would need to submit to their OHI and have an EOB before CHAMPVA would process the claim||
|3|No|Patient Info|Are we allowed to add an additional field to collect the beneficiary’s email address?<br>A stakeholder said they look it up manually if they need to contact the person, so if we can include this to further streamline the the process. There is not currently an email field on the PDF<br>|No|No||
|4|No|General|Can we allow one cover sheet for multiple claims? (implement a list and loop or something so user only has to fill out the PDF info once)|Yes|Yes| Correct, all of the documents that will turn into a claim in the future are under that one claim form so we can accept one cover sheet for multiple claims for one beneficiary. Each beneficiary must submit their claims seperately from other beneficaries. For example a parent would submit their claims under one cover sheet and a child must have their claims submitted under a seperate cover sheet. When the claims come in, that form is for one beneficiary and all the docs that turn into a claim all use that claim form||
|5|No|General|Do most people who submit these claims have an authorized account they can log into and we can pull their information?|No|No||
|6|No|General|What’s the rough percentage of people who have a login vs those who do not?|No|No||
|7|No|General|Does each different beneficiary need to complete their own PDF/ online form submission?|Yes|Yes| Yes, each beneficiary must submit their claims seperately from other beneficaries. For example a parent would submit their claims under one cover sheet and a child must have their claims submitted under a seperate cover sheet.

|8|No|General|Is it possible that something someone enters here would make them no longer eligible for CHAMPVA? Specifically regarding the OHI|No|No||
|9|No|General|Generally speaking, how does the person know whether they need to submit the claim or whether their provider will do it? |Yes|Yes||
|10|No|General|What kind of connection does this have with pre-authorized claims? Is there any info we can pull from that to be helpful? |No|No||
|11|No|General|How does resubmission affect this flow? Do we need to ask if it is a resubmission or does it not matter?|Yes|Yes||
|12|No|General|What is the optical scanner like? Is that a machine that’s used on the VA side or is it a software that could be used immediately upon document upload?|Yes|Yes||
|13|No|General|How do you match up the condition the patient is being treated for and the documents they upload? Because you do need to know what’s being treated in order to approve it, right?|Yes|Yes| All the information matches up with what is on the medical claims itself. Don’t actually need to connect claims with conditions. If their name/info matches the cover sheet and doc – then they look it up on the backend. Once they get the claims someone keys in the claim. Once the claim is processed in the system the rest is then driven all through AI.<br> We need to watch out for fraud so claims forms need to be linked to documents. We have to have a signed document. Not allowed to just use a claim form and attach to their info so we need to have the paper docs. Cannot process docs without a signed claim form either. We can also instantly marry up claim form with docs that are physically in the building. They submit the main claim form online and then mail in the docs but don’t rely on the situation.<br> Don’t know where they’re trying to go with the claim form in the future: Veteran-centric first, then employee-centric||
|14|Yes|General| What is the diagnosis code and who is responsible for entering that?|Yes|Yes| The diagnosis code would not be relevant to the claim form itself. May not need it on the form. Just need the document that they submit be relevant to them and match to their personal info. Can connect that code and conditions on the backend primarily through AI once in the system (will be on the forms provided by the doctor: HCFA and UB)||
