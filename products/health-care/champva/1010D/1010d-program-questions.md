|Number|Complete?|Form Section|Question|Blocking?|Answer|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1||General|Which addresses (Signer’s, sponsors and applicants addresses) are required for fulfilling benefits?|||
|2||General|Which phone numbers (Signer’s, sponsors and applicants phone numbers ) are required for fulfilling benefits?|||||
|3||General|Should we rearrange the content to clarify the instance of a spouse, child or caretaker applying that is also a Veteran. The Sponsor/ Veteran language may need to be retooled. How common is this situation?|||
|4||Certification|Who determines the respondent's burden time? Now that we are moving to a digital format with file upload the current time list on the form (15 minutes) will probably change|||
|5||Sponsor|Is the VBA rating decision and the  DD214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) required?  If an applicant does not submit these docs, does this significantly increase the processing time or can the applicant skip these 2 doc uploads without little impact/ delay?|||
|6||Sponsor|If a non-Veteran applicant doesn’t know where to find the VBA rating for their sponsor, how do they find a copy of it?|||
|7|Y|Sponsor|There is a question about how the Veteran (Sponsor) died? Does this affect anything in terms of benefits or what documents they need to upload (ie. a death certificate with the reason of death)?|N|Based [the only info I could find](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/shshr4/who_can_look_up_my_va_disability_information/), the only ways someone who isn't a Veteran can get the information are if they are given power of attorney by the Veteran or if the Veteran has already sent a letter releasing that information to the person. With this is mind, I don't think there is really anything we can do here.|
|8||Sponsor|What is the purpose of the sponsor’s address information (so we can explain to users)?|||
|9||Applicants|Can we confirm if caretakers are still eligible? There seems to be conflicting messages among the supporting informational materials for this program where caretakers are not listed as an eligible applicant.|||
|10||Applicants|Are there any supporting docs needed for caretakers to upload for CHAMPVA enrollment?|||
|11|yes|Applicants|Is there or should we put a limit on how many applicants can be added to the digital form. Syd and I asked the VFF team but it seems like this is unique to the services we are using on the 1010d. (Central Mail vs Box)||limit to 3 for now|
|12||Applicants|The requirements for the School Certs are very strict based on the current state of the form. It states that a letter or a form must be submitted and sent by the school to VA. This of course will blow up the file upload experience. Are the stakeholders willing to update this process to allow for the applicant to submit it. What types of documents will they take or not?|||
|13||Applicants|Is the school certification only required for children of the sponsor?|||
|14||Applicants|If the applicant was married to the sponsor, but the sponsor died, and they have not remarried, do they need to upload the sponsor’s death certificate?|||
|15||Third-party Signer|Is the phone number and address absolutely required?|||
|16||Confirmation Page|Would we be able to create a button for an applicant to email a copy of the confirmation page to themselves. We understand that some applicants may want to still mail the documents and we will provide the instructions to do so on the confirmation page. |||
|17||Confirmation Page|Who determines the respondent's burden time? Now that we are moving to a digital format with file upload the current time list on the form (15 minutes) will probably change|||
|18||Certification|There may be use case where the signer is a Veteran and does not provide an address/phone number. We want to accommodate folks experiencing homelessness, but also the signer is required to provide an address. as it currently stands. Is the signer having an address a requirement? If it is, how can we work around this for folks experiencing homelessness?|||
|19||Certification|We accommodate potential houselessness for the Veteran/Sponsor, but not for applicants or a third party signer (e.g, a VSO). Can we shift to accommodate that on our form, as well?|||
