- If a third party (or anyone other than an applicant) is filling this form out, do we need to collect their contact info?
There's a box at the bottom 
- Is Name, DOB and SSN enough to identify a person so PA can add info to their “file”?
- What is the existing process for 10-7959c and 10-10d? (Our recommendation is for the digital 1010D form and OHI form to come in within the same workflow, unless applicants choose to mail in their cards/10-7959c form). If we plan to pull out the 10-7959c info from the 1010d to keep it separate, how would having this come in at two separate times impact the process?
