**Early/Resubmissions/Duplicate submissions**

-   IVC team updates: getting a couple of updates into the form prior to initial launch! Walkthrough of the roadmap, what's coming after launch. Current timeline for launch (initial announcement to come in the next few days).
-   Walkthrough the initial launch updates enrollment screener question in Figma (updates for launch)
-   Walkthrough of fast-follow updates in Figma
    -   Additional enrollment info in screener
    -   Resub screener question
        -   Question from CHAMPVA claims partners: If a bene submits a document and they attach 2 of 3 documents they needed to attach - would they get a notice to not submit a resubmission right now?
            -   For the time being, they would be stopped by the resub question, until PEGA is ready to receive resubmissions
            -   CHAMPVA claims has noticed that recently, a bene will fax in an entire document, and they're receiving a duplicate submission or resubmission (if the fax didn't go through) the rest of the documents in a different submission under a different PDI number.
            -   IVC team also notes there's a submission confirmation page to help with any uncertainty around a claim going through, and this should minimize duplicate submissions as best as possible.
    -   Terminology on "I have already submitted my claim but haven't received a letter" accordion: Does the language "explanation of benefits letter" capture denials/resub letters? Is there a blanket term used for all communications from CHAMPVA claims?
        -   EOB corresponds to approvals/denials, Send back letter is for resubmissions
        -   AI: Update content corresponding to CHAMPVA claims letters and notify C/IA team


**Online claims resubmissions next steps**

-   Send back letter directs benes to submit online. What is the process like to update that letter to correspond to filing resubs online?
    -   CHAMPVA claims team says updating the send back letters, it would take 1-2 weeks to update that information. "More or less instantaneous"
    -   AI: IVC team to coordinate launch of resubmissions online with CHAMPVA Claims partners to make sure the letters notify benes of the online resub option.


**OHI questions**

-   Do we need the effective date as a separate question on the online form if we are still uploading the cards?
    -   It's possible to transfer that metadata in PEGA so that it's automatic. Having that data field filled out is used downstream, so having it populated is preferable.
-   What would happen if we completely remove the the insurance policy and insurance provider phone number? That is an optional field, and users have gotten stuck on that question in testing the online form.
    -   Same as effective date - useful to have at the time of filing, but we'll fill it in if it's not included.
-   Question from CHAMPVA claims: is OHI form live?
    -   IVC team: confirmed, it's live. Quick mention of in-progress integration work between the 10-10d and the OHI Cert


**Updates to the CHAMPVA Claims PDF form**

-   See the copy [Premal shared in Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C05UDS77ZPH/p1743529863836499) 4/1/25
    -   PDF contains _desired_ changes, not set in stone. There is no launch date announced.
    -   AI: IVC team to review PDF (Jamie started an initial review) to capture any changes we need to add to the backlog. The goal is to keep parity with the PDF form.
