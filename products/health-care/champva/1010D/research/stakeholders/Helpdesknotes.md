**Agenda**
Understand the helpdesk metrics better

Notes:
 - All calls are defaulted to claims as a category.
 - The data given is only for CHAMPVA data, but other programs have a far lower number.
 - 80 percent of claims calls have to do with "where are we on this claim".
 - 20 percent of claims calls have to do with what's wrong with my payment.
 - There is no integration between CXM and CRM 
 - What can we show on VA.gov to reduce claims volume? PPR report is what we need to show on VA.gov. Brian will send a copy of this. EOB is similar to a PPR
  report. 
  - Status updates will also help a lot, right now there is NO  information online forcing everyone to make a call. 
  - Beneficiary claims processing is very difficult. Most of that has to do with the very  strict business requirements.  
  - 60/40 Provider/Beneficiary calls breakdown. 
   - For enrollments and applications, status is also an  important thing. The enrollment team has to check 5 different systems to complete their job. 
   - Due to the manual process of sending letters, it causes the call center fill out OHI form on the phone and submitting to the the enrollment team. This also takes a lot of phone
   time, causing others to wait longer. Is the Medicare card is really
   required?
