Attendees: Andrea, Angela C, Jamie, Amanda, Elizabeth, Angela P, Rachel, Jina, Arleen, Premal, Renata, Mike, Erick, Ballard, Arleen, Alexandria

**Agenda**

-   10-10d/OHI merge
-   Supporting docs

  
**10-10d/OHI merge**

-   We heard when we worked on the claims form, that each applicant can have only up to two types of private health insurance. Do you know of any instances where people have submitted more than two, and what has happened?
    -   Applicants can have as many insurances as they want. 3 or 4 plans, or supplementary plans, are accepted. There's no hard and fast rules. Is it common to have more than dual coverage (2 plans)? No. But it does happen
    -   Re: when we heard this during earlier CHAMPVA claims calls: There's no limit; the most they've seen is 2 health insurances, that's the standard. Only seen 4 health insurances happen once in 18+ years
-   Medicare card uploads: the back of the red, white and blue Medicare cards contain the same information as the front. Do you really need both?
    -   Yes, that's standard in the health care industry. We need front and back for all Medicare cards
-   If applicants have Part C, do you need both the original Medicare card and the part C?
    -   Yes. This is to reduce confusion when processing applications/claims and reduce accidental denials.

 
**Request from CHAMPVA partners around the CHAMPVA application and OHI cert**

-   Just came from an event and a lot of beneficiaries were confused about needing to have Parts A+B in addition to everything else (required to be CHAMPVA eligible for ages 65 and older). But we want to make sure those 64 and under are not confused that this eligibility applies to them.
-   If you're under 65, you can have Medicare Part A, but it's not required to have it to be eligible.
    -   AI: Review content on [VA.gov](http://VA.gov) an ensure we're being super clear about this eligibility.
    -   AI: For ongoing 10-10d/OHI merge L&L discovery, review logic based on birthdate to add Medicare A+B so applicants under 65 are not being asked that question.


**Supporting docs**

-   Currently in the CHAMPVA application, there are some supporting docs that are optional that it may speed up processing to include. Should we make them required, or eliminate? (Rating decision, proof of remarriage, birth certificate for a child of the sponsor).
    -   Rating decision - not needed, remove
    -   DD-214 - not needed, remove (if still on the form)
    -   Birth certificate - optional, and keep optional
        -   Reasons for keeping optional:
            -   we'll check VBA if they've added that dependent to the VRO. If they haven't they're sent a letter to add that child as a dependent.
            -   Only needed for blended families (step-child or adopted). If they're already listed in Share as a dependent, there's just no need for that birth cert, only if they're not.
            -   **After discussion**: CHAMPVA partners are OK to remove the optional verbiage, BUT, if removing optional verbiage becomes a problem, we'll have a discussion to add back in.
    -   Proof of remarriage - required
-   AI: make a note of what happens for any document that is required and isn't submitted, to better understand how to separate "nice to haves" vs. "required" supporting documentation. To understand when something that's a nice to have is actually going to stop processing on an application.
    -   IVC team to send that list over (Angela C requesting to look at the list) and update the service blueprint to reflect these details


## **03/18/25**

### **Agenda**

* Review how contact information and addresses are used for the signer, sponsor and applicants  
* Review questions about supporting documents  
* Review how duplication ChampVA applications will affect the backlog

### **Contact information**

* Background: there are 3 user types who can fill out the 10-10d \-- the sponsor (Veteran), the beneficiary, and the signer (possibly a parent/caregiver who is not the Veteran, or a third party like an accredited representative/VSO)

|  | Signer | Sponsor (Veteran) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Mailing address** | We want basic information on the Signer to verify who they are, will not be sending them anything through the mail, especially if they're a third party representative\* | Traditionally that would be if there was information that was for the Veteran-only. With the digital experience that doesn't really apply anymore. We aren't going to contact them, but we build a sponsor profile and that information is needed to verify the sponsor (sponsor profile is built first and then a beneficiary file underneath). |
| **Email** | Only reason we might contact the signer is if the application is incomplete or the applicants are incapacitated but that gets into POA stuff. | "-" |
| **Phone number** | “-” | "-" |

**\*Signer**

* Are we going to ask signers for proof of POA or similar? POA might be on file in VBMS, but these are brand new applicants whose POA isn't established in VBMS we're not able to take action on the application until receipt of POA.  
  * Unclear if ChampVA would reach out to the signer to request proof of POA if that wasn't found in VBMS.  
  * Current process is just to review to make sure there's a signature on the 10-10d at all (no current process to confirm POA).  
* What happens if an application isn't signed? Do you contact the Signer to complete?  
  * If an application isn't signed, there's part of a VistA flow where you mark "not signed" and a CCL letter is generated to send back. But the application is otherwise processed.  
  * "It needs to be input like you normally would and then instead of updating them (P\&T/PR) then you will send a CCL letter (CCL-B59-if an OHI cert isn't signed we need a CCL-A55)"

**Action Items**

* Determine if proof of POA is a showstopper and whether we need to revisit adding proof of power of attorney/power of representation and make that a gate on the digital form so signers can't proceed without proof.  
  * ChampVA doesn't have numbers on how big of an issue this is (can we request this post-meeting)  
  * Mocks were already made previously  
* Update service blueprint around unsigned application  
* Content updates  
  * Update content on Signer mailing address screen  
  * On signer email/phone number screen: "we use this information to contact you if we have more questions." this copy is wrong. ChampVA does not call, email or contact the Signer about the application, they contact the Beneficiary via letters.  
    * In instances where the address/contact information is not the same between the signer and Veteran/beneficiary, the mail goes to the beneficiary's address  
    * It sounds like there's an end goal on the ChampVA side to use email/contact info as a reachout process, but that's not going to happen until the backlog is moved through and ChampVA is transitioned off VistA to their new system.
