# [CHAMPVA Tricare Eligibility Usabilty Study] Research Findings

## Research Goals

1. Learn where there are content comprehension issues within the eligibility questions and error messages options tested.

2. Discovery around two flows - one using a new VADS pattern and the other with a VADS pattern and API hybrid approach - to determine usability and user preference for both.
   
3. Learn if there are any usability issues with the new VADS eligibility pattern and/or hybrid option.


## Research questions

`Goal 1: Learn where there are content comprehension issues within the eligibility questions and error messages options tested.`

**`1.`[Do participants find the introduction page eligibility content clear and easy to understand?]**

**`2.`[Do participants find the eligibilty questions asked in the VADS pattern flow confusing, unclear or state they need additional information?]**

**`3.`[Do participants understand the content in the error messages clear enough to state what specific action, if any, they would need to take when applying for benefits?]**



`Goal 2: Discovery around two flows - one using a new VADS pattern and the other with a VADS pattern and API hybrid approach - to determine usabilty and user preference for both.`

**`1.`[Is the flow of prototype Blueberry and the VADS eligibility pattern easy for participants - both Veterans and family members?]**

**`2.`[What flow do participants seem to find easier via self-reported ratings and quotes?]**


`Goal 3: Learn if there are any usability issues with the new VADS eligibility pattern and/or hybrid option.`

**`1.`[Do participants clearly understand the eligibility gray results box with the icons in the pattern?]**

**`2.`[Do the error alerts in the hybrid option add any confusion or do participants state incorrect actions needed?]**


## Methodology 
- [Semi-structured interviews/usabilty testing with mid-fidelty prototypes to explore two options of implementation and content options for alerts]



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

- **Hypothesis Statement:** [We assume that both Veterans and their family members will find the hybrid API-driven approach to provide more immediate, personalized feedback than the VADS pattern approach, but both may have different strengths.]  
  - **"Maybe True"**  
  - Participants self-reported a mix of preference. 6 preferred Blueberry, 5 preferred Pineapple and 4 stated they were similar or had no preference.
  - Some of those who stated Pineapple as their prferrence the reason why was due to the prototype appearing to check DEERS for their TRICARE status. 


- **Hypothesis Statement:** [We assume that the VADS pattern will add clarity to the eligibility of CHAMPVA benefits and will be recieved positively by both Veterans and their family members.]  
  - **“Likely False”**  
  - Key finding 1: The “Check eligibility” default pattern was confusing to most participants when they were not eligible (Pineapple prototype) mostly due to the double negative statement and visual misunderstanding. 

 
- **Hypothesis Statement:** [We assume that participants may find both approaches similarly confusing/helpful, suggesting content improvements are more important than flow differences.]  
  - **Likely True**  
  - Participants were split on their preferred preference of a prototype between Blueberry and Pineapple, but many had points of confusion or suggestions of improvement to the content.

## Key Findings


> **After completing your detailed findings below, you'll add metadata labels using the [Key Findings Metadata Labels Prompt](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/copilot-prompts/research-report/add-metadata-labels-to-findings-prompt.md).**  

[Example Key Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/initiatives/2021-post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)

1. The “Check eligibility” default pattern was confusing to most participants when they were not eligible (Pineapple prototype) mostly due to the double negative statement and visual misunderstanding.
2. Participants wanted a clear action or contact information when they saw the first warning alert or the eligibility review screen in the Pineapple prototype and they reported they would continue anyways or contact somebody as next steps - not exit the application.
3. Most participants commented that more definitive language around eligibility would be helpful in understanding the review summary card and almost all preferred the alternate card option B with additional dynamic content explaining their eligibility.
4. Participants stated actions on the various warning alerts overall were to continue on with the application or they wanted contact information to talk to somebody.




## Details of Findings 

*Provide detailed descriptions and supporting evidence for each key finding.*  

> [!TIP]
> **After drafting your detailed findings, apply OCTO metadata labels to enable automated pattern detection and cross-study aggregation.**
> Use the [GitHub Copilot Key Findings Metadata Labels Prompt](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/copilot-prompts/research-report/add-metadata-labels-to-findings-prompt.md) to generate structured YAML label blocks for each finding below.

## Additional Insights
#### Secondary 1

Participants were split in their previous knowledge of CHAMPVA, 9 were aware of it and 6 had never heard of it before at all. However all participants were familiar with TRICARE and 4 participants even stated they were currently enrolled. 


#### Secondary 2

Participants who interacted with the additional information component on the TRICARE question page seemed to appreciate the information and the link to check their status on that site. 

#### Secondary 3

One participant (P14) commented on language used around Veteran living question and that it could be adjusted to be more sensitive

- "They know that, and so sometimes I feel that question might hit a survivor in the wrong way. So, again, we'll ask more questions about those in detail, but I would probably remove answer to the best of your knowledge from this question specifically." (P14)
