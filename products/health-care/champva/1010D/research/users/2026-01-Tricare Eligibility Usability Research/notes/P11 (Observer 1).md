#### Introduction
- Desktop user

#### Warm-up Questions
- Participant hasn't heard of or applied to CHAMPVA, but knows what TRICARE is.

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [X] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- "They don't explain what makes you qualify for CHAMPVA".
- Having more info about qualifications on the side to access more info would be useful.


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- step 1 content still doesn't explain what makes you eligible.
- Likes that they start with Veteran name so users don't put their own name.
- Likes that the questions are simple and not too many on page.
- Likes the popup and you can check your eligibility.
- User believes they are eligible.
- If unsure, they would still continue with the application.
- The icons make it appear they are eligible.
- User is not confident on if they are eligible or not.
**Rating 2**
- The user thinks they are eligible but they are not confident if they are eligible.



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [X] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Notes


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- User "thought they did something."
- User feels the information is off and wants a way to contact the VA.
- Doesn't feel the info is accurate and wants to contact the VA for clarification.
- They want another contact method to verify they are not eligible for TRICARE but would continue with the application.
- Feels like the system is blocking them from proceeding.
- The red x makes it clear they are not eligible and they would stop the application.
- The second prototype was better. They told you that you weren't eligible right away , but there wasn't a way to contact someone to confirm.
**Rating 5**
-  Compared to the first one, because it gave eligibility right away.
-  Would prefer to use Pineapple prototype.
-  Information overall - After reading about CHAMPVA, feels the amount of information is right.
-  Confident they could explain to a friend.



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
**Alert A** - would resubmit but want a way to confirm.
**Alert B** - Feels like the page is down or there is an error on the page. Would wait until later and apply again.
**Alert C** - Resubmit application again and follow up with a person.
**Alert D** - Sorry, it's really confusing. Im not eligible becasue im eligible for Tricare. but would still follow up. A link or contact info would be helpful.
**Alert E** - I like they made it green and the information is clear.

**Rating 5** - Maybe adding a red x on alert D would make it more clear.

#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
**Card A** - Based on check marks they are eligible second not eligible because Tricare.
**Card B** - Is more clear that the sentence distinctly states you're eligible.
- The sentence on B adds clarity.



#### Post-Task Interview
- Would like a way to contact to follow up or a chat service to answer questions.

#### Key Take-away**
1. Iconography helped with understanding of eligibility.
2. Desire to have a contact method for confirmation of eligibility - Phone or chat.
3. Less information on the page adds to quick comprehension and clarity.
4. Users will still proceed even if eligibility is questionable.
5. Having capability to immediately inform users of their eligibility with minimal content and clear messaging with supporting iconography is desirable, and may prevent unnecessary contact with the VA.
