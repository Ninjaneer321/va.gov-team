#### Introduction
- Consents to recording screen and audio
- Consents to sharing a video clip of the session

#### Warm-up Questions
- Applied to CHAMPVA program a long time ago
- Who's eligible: Spouse sponsor has to be 100% disabled to get it, and it's not like typical health insurance
- TRICARE: yes I was on that when my husband was active (duty)
- Difference between TRICARE and CHAMPVA: TRICARE is active duty military and their spouse and dependents. Some people can have it when they retire. But there's this whole group who can get CHAMPVA, but it's meant more for Veterans and their dependent spouses, and the Veteran has to bee 100% to be eligible. I have a lot of opinions about the CHAMPVA program.

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- It's pretty basic, it looks to me like the instructions for how to apply (for CHAMPVA)
- You can look up what to do if you already have benefits, you can check eligibility, you can start an application and go from there.
- Who's eligible: According to this page, spouses and dependents or survivors of a Veteran or service member who meets certain requirements.
- I guess I could click on the link to find out more...
- And you can't apply for CHAMPVA if you're eligible for TRICARE! That makes sense
- I'd look under #1 to check if I was eligible.
- Uncertain about applying? No, to me it seems pretty straightforward, but then I've been doing this stuff forever.
- It seems very easy to understand, very simple. This is what you need to have...eventually upload the forms of proof and certificates or whatnot.
- I'd probably continue applying at this point. I'd have researched this beforehand and I'd have what I'd need to do this.
- I think finding all the supporting documents would take a while
- Very confident about applying


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- If I was doing this for real I wouldn't read it (the eligibility chapter heading screen), I'd hit continue and keep going. You're just reiterating the eligibility requirements and needing the Veteran's information
- All very straightforward, nothing out of the ordinary
- Likes the "I don't know" option for TRICARE eligibility
- WOOHOO
- It's easy to understand why you've got your eligibility
- I like the exit button if I didn't qualify, but I'd click continue and move on
- What this page means: I'm eligible to receive CHAMPVA benefits because of my Veteran's disability status (whether they've passed on or not) and we're not eligible for TRICARE. Now we need to fill out the rest of the form to get our cards or whatever for this benefit.
- Checkmark icons: means you're good to go, you met the two different requirements for eligibility. If one of them showed up red, either there's a problem and you need to fix something in the form, or you're not eligible for CHAMPVA and need to exit the application and figure something else out
- Confidence: Very confident to me, it's incredibly straightforward. Green means go. It explains why you're eligible. I would have to assume it would tell you why you're not eligible if you aren't.
- Comprehension rating: 5, very easy, incredibly easy. It's simple and easy to understand and very clear. The only other thing that could be added between the title and gray would be something saying "you are eligible!" or "you are not eligible" in big bold green or red to really be more simple.



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Once again, no confusion around role selection and what they mean
- Veteran information is very clearly labeled. You know it's for your sponsor, the language here makes complete sense
- Now it's saying you may not be eligible because someone is in DEERS.
- Eligibility check: I like it, it makes it easier for you, the user. It lets you know hey, there's a problem. There could be a glitch or you're really not eligible. But you find out immediately, you don't need to wait for weeks to get a letter in the mail.
- I think it's helpful. It's easier for me to know what to do to move forward.
- Trust: for me irl it's not, but for the sake of this scenario yes, I trust that this is applicable. But IRL if I got this I'd say oh there's a problem. We haven't been in DEERS for years and someone made a mistake.
- I'd probably go talk to my husband and say there's a problem. We need to find out who to talk to because something isn't right in the records (based on my real life situation).
- If this alert applied to me and I saw this IRL I'd stop trying to apply because we already has TRICARE. I may find a TRICARE representative to ask what's going on. There's just no point in moving forward if I'm not eligible for CHAMPVA
- Anything else I want to see here: some kind of a link to take you to where you can talk to someone, like a phone number or a chatbot (I hate chatbots). Just some way to talk to a person to ask what does this mean, why did it pop up.
- Would talk to my husband first, then a representative.
- I think the system is helping. You may not want to move forward with your application until you figure out what's going on.
- About eligibility summary: See I like it! You get the red X! I thought you would! I'm excited.
- Actions taken: Well again, I still think there should be an alert in color to really emphasize if you are or aren't eligible. I would try to find out...I would want to talk to someone to find out what's happening here (understands the X to mean NOT eligibile for TRICARE).
- I would probably exit and try to find someone to talk to. This is conflicting information
- Comprehension rating: 5, it was very easy
- Prototype preference: No strong preference. I can't even tell you the difference between the two.
- Just the right amount of information to decide if you want to move forward, get more information, or stop the application altogether.
- I could easily walk someone through this process. 



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Alert A: That would be scary. Not that the alert is bad, but it could cause a little panic. I'd go back and double check the information, but if I still got the alert....PHEW. I need a link to talk to a person to find out what's going on. I would probably still try to apply, but I'd need to get this cleared up before I can move forward.
- Alert B: I would probably hit "continue" so I could see what happened next and what I could complete. Then I'd try to find a representative to speak to to say hey, I was filling out the application, this happened, is there something on your end that can be fixed to move forward?
- Alert C: I would do the same thing as Alert B. The biggest thing is making sure there's access to a representative who can look into this and find out what's going on. Even if the systems are down right now, just wants confirmation. If for whatever reason the systems are down, I want confirmation of that (even in the alert message content). Having a timeline of when it will be fixed would be extremely helpful so I'm not worried it's me, it's you.
- Alert D: I would stop the application because it clearly says that for whatever reason, you're not eligible because you're found in DEERS. I would want to find a representative to find out why I'm still in DEERS. I shouldn't be in the system. I want to get that straightened out, OR I am in DEERS and CHAMPVA is not available to me at this time.
- Alert E: I like it, straight forward. Hit continue, don't need to speak to anybody, just keep going.

- Confidence: 5
- changes: Make the alert D red so you know there's a problem and not to go. This is a stop. 


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- As she reads the cards: oh OK, now I understand
- On card style A, I like the green checks. The red X, makes me think something is wrong. The X kind of, I mean I understand it, but it needs to be really bold that you may not be eligible for CHAMPVA. I don't understand if you're not eligible for TRICARE you should be OK (is tripped up by the double negative). I may not be reading it correctly but my mind's saying hey wait a minute...
- All 4 cards are telling me whether to proceed with my application or you probably should stop the application and figure out where the problem is so you can either move forward or stop altogether.
- Stop the difference: Yes see? I like Card Style B the little red X makes more sense to me. The Veteran is eligible for TRICARE, so therefore YOU are not eligible for CHAMPVA. That's not messing with my brain.
- Can't spot the difference between the cards, is prompted by the moderator to see
- I like "your responses" (in card style A). Hmmmm (in Card Style B). Alright. In B, I like the statement "your responses met all the eligibility" but it needs to be bolder or a different color so you realize you met everything. Or didn't meet everything. So it stands out. My eye went right past that sentence to the check marks and the X.
- Preference: Card style B. It's the stupid wording with the X in card style A that got me. The content and use of icons in card style B matches. It's a go, or you're a no.
- Anything else unclear or confusing? Not anything that I've already said. 



#### Post-Task Interview
- Any other feedback? Not that I can think of. I'm happy that they're moving to an online registration system. When I applied many years ago we got denied and it was a paper process. You had to wait forever and a day to get your letter back. And I like that you could stop your application if you're in the middle so you can come back. I like that you get immediate feedback (on eligibility). You're not waiting weeks.
  - I never redid the application again, I never bothered. This was 12 years ago. 
 
- Preferences for eligibility content: No. Minor tweaks to make things a little more bold to stand out for people, but this makes it really to know what to do.
  
- If you guys can fix the actual program itself and make it easier to handle...The application was such a horrible process and we got denied. I've joined forums learning about CHAMPVA and you don't know what doctors take this program. Doctors don't have a clear understanding of how to bill this program. There's a lot of confusion with TRICARE. People get large bills sent to them. It's a hassle to talk to anyone. It's a hassle to wait 6-8 months before you're even enrolled. That's insane! You have to be really on top of your doctors and billing to be in the program to make sure that everybody is doing what they're supposed to be doing. It's not clear what medical procedures are approved. Coverages aren't easily understood.
- Had I seen this eligibility information when I applied, I might consider applying in the future.
