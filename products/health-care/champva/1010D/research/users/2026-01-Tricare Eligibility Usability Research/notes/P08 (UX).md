#### Introduction
- Sure (record screen and audio)
- Sure (video clips)

- [Recording starts]
- Yes
- Yes


#### Warm-up Questions
- I don’t know what this is, so no
- Yes (heard of TRICARE)

(On mobile device)



#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- links don’t work, right … 
- It’s basically staging if you are a spouse, dependent or survivor of Veteran might be eligible through this program.
- Okay if you are eligible for TRICARe you can’t get CHAMPVA, so that is a disqualifying factor
- It seems pretty straightforward
- Someone can apply or see if they qualify if they can get this CHAMPVA insurance that I am guessing is through the VA, but if you are eligible for TRICARE
- I am assuming if you are a dependent of getting Tricare, you can’t double dip
- But not the Veteran should be able to get VA health care that is separate from this and use your Tricare
- I just clicked on it right here (link to static page)
- Spouse or dependent or … reads through content in blue eligibility box… and if you do that and you don’t qualify for Tricare, yeah.

- Well no, not upfront, but I understand it is a prototype. Would want to click through everything. I would want to expand it (read into all content on the static page)

- Once I read this eligibility requirement, would want to read through everything to make sure I’m not missing anything before going on.

- (informed rating) I would say 5 even though I can’t click on the expanded portion. There is enough information here

Would want to go into pages for additional info, click on accordions,

- I would like to review, but based off the idea if your child is eligible for Tricare, because if you are 100% rating and you got the retirement from the military you are still getting TRICARE
- If your children or spouse is eligible to receive Tricare you are not eligible for this program 



#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Veteran applying for my spouse okay… 
- Looks pretty straightforward
- Based on the Veterans information (reads through warning alert)
- It’s good (eligibility) it is a double check right, if you happen to miss that portion and you wanted to apply anyways it is a good check, I do like this portion of it.
- I do not like the fact that you are not eligible, because I thought you were..
- If you are able to login securely and enter in your identifiable information here, it is not a problem
- Yes (alert accurate)
- I would stop applying (if saw this message) I wouldn’t go any further
- No, you can always do finish this application later if you want to research a little more, that save button
- Maybe a link to something, can I click continue maybe my answer would be after this?
- If I click continue, would it reiterate the information why I am not eligible or a contact information to get more information about CHAMPVA

- I click the continue.. is it okay if I continue through to see if I would get my answer…

- If I am not eligible, a link that will bring me back to the criteria again. That main page that has the criteria and contact information on the bottom if not eligible
- Or bring me back to that original page I believe that had contact information at the bottom

- (is assuming info wrong) If they had that link I would go there to get that contact information to see who I need to reach out to, or what department 

- I guess I would, if it lets me continue I can save it at any point, if I really believe I didn’t qualify.
- If I didn’t have TRICARe and this information wasn’t correct, would continue the application, save for later and go to contact information 

- I can see it both ways (blocking and helping)
- For me, I know I wouldn’t qualify, I know already (mentions content)
- But if I didn’t and saw this I could see how it is blocking as well

- I like that link that was there, check your eligibility for TRICARE. So at least it takes you to another link, does it kick you out of this one? Just opens up another tab right? That’s good

- So this one basically goes over what the requirements, what you meet and what you don’t meet. And you can always save your application or exit the application because you don’t qualify.

- No (can’t get CHAMPVA if eligible for TRICARE)

- The check mark means this is what allows me to qualify for CHAMPVA, the red X tells me I am not, 
- I don’t like the verbiage here, it sounds like the Veteran is not elgibile for TRICARE not CHAMPVA (double negative on item with red x)
- I understand why, but can see how it can be interpreted another way

- I do have a question though - just because, you may not be eligible now a dependent of a Veteran who is permanently and totally disabled, would they be eligible for this program once they age out of Tricare


- There was something else, on if there are kids with special needs if they qualify for Tricare. Not clear when they age out.

- I would exit application (if really applying today)

- I would give it a 4 just because of the verbiage I didn’t like about the Veteran not eligible for TRICARE bullet. 



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE



#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Probably what I didn’t see on the other one, it is separated. It is not all lumped together in one paragraph, chunked and easier to read. 

- Okay, this is pretty straightforward as well, same as the other one

I like this page, you don’t require a lot of information and too much scrolling , fill it out and continue. Chunking it makes it easier to digest.
I like that required is in red, makes it easy to spot.

- So this one they said no - see how this goes (noting Tricare answer)

Eligibility summary
- Again I like how it is presented here
- When I see two checkmarks I assume I am a go - 
- The same with that verbiage, when I go back .. this one makes more sense. That makes sense, where the previous one I click I was eligible, it stated this same statement here, so that is why it can be confusing.
- This verbiage for this particular application makes sense to me.

- I would continue 

- (rating easy difficulty) Uh, 5

- Um, honestly didn’t have any preference, the one thing that stood out to me, I’m a stickler for verbiage. So this part down here (tricare line item) was confusing due to how it was checked on the page previously
- they both seem really easy to use
- I think about the right amount, because if you needed to you had link to go back and refer
- Yes (explain to friend) 


#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
Alert A
- First, double check information. Second, I would actually go to contact information and try to reach out to somebody or make an appointment with the VA to make sure I am registered in the VA system to be able to do that.
- At that appointment let them know I was trying to do with applying for CHAMPVA and that they can’t find me in the system. If it is error in the system or something with the website
- If it was the website, some sort of banner across, try again later
- yes, as long as I can save my work. If I can’t save anything no point of continuing on
- How long does it save for??
- As long as it can save, continue on, if it is a bug with the website or something not waste my time filling something out

Alert B
- I would still continue my application
- First double check my information, check that, then continue, and if still get this message same protocol as before. Reach out and schedule an appointment with the VA eligibility office area, to go down and let them know exactly what is going on.


Alert C
- Okay… yeah, I would do exactly the same thing as alert b. But I like alert b’s message better. It is cleaner, shorter and straight to the point. 
- I don’t like the or select continue .. yeah. 


Alert D
- (reads through content of alert a couple of times)
- I get what it is saying, but I have to slow down to digest it a little bit. 
- If you aren’t enrolled in DEERS … not sure if there is a way to wordsmith it, understand why it is that way, but… ( reads through content again)
- I just the wording is a little off for me here. I think maybe too many thoughts in one sentence. I am in this way because correcting my kids homework lately :)
- (reads through again) Due to be eligible for Tricare, or something like that. Doesn’t seem solid, if somebody reading through it 
- If I had the continue, no, if I knew that I wasn’t eligible in the first place, I wouldn’t continue.
- If I knew that I received TRICARE, I wouldn’t continue. IF I am not continuing TRICARE, … I might not continue if my kid was found in DEERS, I don’t know if that is an accident .. I don’t know I would go back and check with DEERS. I would maybe save the application at this point, but I wouldn’t continue. 


Alert E
- Okay, I would continue.
- I like the color coding - this is what VA uses anyways 

- 5 (confidence scale for alerts0
- Just that one, not unclear, but maybe stated a little differently.



#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- I like the checkmarks, helps me see the different bullet points I guess
- Again, this we talked about this before. That is the only thing I don’t like there (double negative on the eligibility card)
- How I read it - Veteran is not eligible for TRICARE, yeah I’m not eligible for Tricare so why can’t I get CHAMPVA?

- yep that makes sense, didn’t meet all the requirements, I like that

- I like this one right here, I like that statement “responses didn’t meet all the eligibility”.. yeah that’s better! (Option B)

- Basically the summary of if I qualified or didn’t . The check marks are what qualifies you , x is what disqualifies you.

- (at a glance) I like, the last card style B. Where it says you met all, it helps summarize it a little more. It states out there, yes you qualify or no you didn’t and this is why. 



#### Post-Task Interview
- no (nothing else to add)
- Um no, I think VA in general makes it pretty easy. A standard thing you see, seems pretty straightforward.
- I don’t know those Veterans who are in a different generation, like my parents and what not, how they struggle with the computer.. if they see too many links, it can get overly confusing, but where you have those drop down boxes to open, those are good. I like those (additional info component or accordions) 
- Whether or not they are computer savvy can still navigate the information. 

- yep that’s fine (sharing clip confirmation)
