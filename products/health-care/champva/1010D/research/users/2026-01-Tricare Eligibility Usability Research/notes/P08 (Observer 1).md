#### Introduction
- Consents to screen and audio recording
- Consents to use of video clips

#### Warm-up Questions
- Has not applied to CHAMPVA before
- Has never heard of CHAMPVA before
- Knows about TRICARE

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Asks if the links work
- If you're a spouse or dependent you can get this program
- If you're eligible for TRICARE you can't get CHAMPVA. That's a disqualifying factor (goes to the Drupal page)
- It seems pretty straightforward. Personnel can apply or see if they qualify for CHAMPVA first
- I guess this is like health insurance through the VA for spouses and dependents?
- If you're a dependent of a Veteran on TRICARE you can't double-dip. Specifically for the spouse, dependent, but not the Veteran. The Veteran can get health care through VA benefits and use TRICARE, that's different.
- Eligibility: clicks on the static page link again and reads through the eligibility information in the blue box.
- Uncertain about applying: No, not upfront. But I understand this is a prototype. I would've liked to click through everything (every link)
- Once I read the eligibility requirements I want to make sure I'm not missing anything before I go forward further or apply
- Content rating: 5
- I would like to review all the information first. 


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Thoughts on the eligibility check: it's good, it's like a second check if you missed that portion in the eligibility information outside of the form. I don't like that it's telling me I'm not eligible because I thought I was, but that's OK
- Helpful: it's not asking any additional information than I'd expect to give on a form. It's not a problem.
- I trust the information in the alert is accurate
- If I saw this IRL I'd stop applying. I wouldn't go any further.
- I don't want to see anything else. I see "finish this application later" if I wanted to stop and do more research. Maybe a link to something
- I'd want a link going back to the criteria from this screen in the form, with contact information should I have any questions regarding why I am not eligible.
- Or take me back to that original page, because there's contact information there.

[Lost some of the conversation because of lag]

- I like the How to check for TRICARE eligibility additional info component and how it opens in a new tab (especially calls out the new tab part)
- Reads the eligibility summary carefully
- Basically tells you what the requirements are and what you do/don't meet. You can save, continue, or exit the application
- Understands you cannot get CHAMPVA if you have TRICARE
- Checkmark means this is what allows me to qualify for CHAMPVA. The X means I'm not eligible because of this particular requirement. But I don't like the verbiage. This is stated like a double negative.
- Understands she's not eligible based on the summary content
- 100% confident
- Question: will dependent children ever become eligible for CHAMPVA after they age out of TRICARE? On kids with special needs, if they're not eligible for TRICARE, are they eligible for CHAMPVA? Wants more information
- I would exit the application if I was really filling this out today. This doesn't apply to me any more.
- Comprehension rating: 4, just because of that verbiage I didn't like/understand



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Likes the chunked content on the eligibility check content screen
- When I see two check marks, I assume I am good to go
- Notes that the verbiage for TRICARE eligibility is still odd, but it makes a little more sense if you're not eligible for TRICARE. If it had a red X, it would make less sense.
- I would continue, based on this criteria and the message
- Comprehension rating: 5
- Comparing the prototypes: no preference, but the TRICARE eligibility language on the summary messaging was hard to understand on prototype pineapple
- Just enough content/information
- I could explain this to a friend



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Alert A: I would check the info that I entered to make sure it's correct. If it pops up again, I would go to contact information and try to reach out, or schedule a VA appointment to make sure that I was registered in the VA system. At the appointment, I'd let them know what I was trying to apply for with CHAMPVA and that they can't find me in the system. From there, would determine if it was an error in the system, or if it's something with the website. I would continue with the application as long as I can save my form in progress.
- Alert B: I would check the information but save the form in progress. 
- Alert C: same action as Alert B, but I like the content in Alert C better than Alert B.
- Alert D: I had to slow down to understand. It seems like a lot, it needs some wordsmithing. I might not continue if my kid was found in DEERS, unless that was an accident. So maybe I'd just save my application at this point, but I wouldn't continue.
- Alert E: I would continue. I like the color coding.
- Confidence rating: 5


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Card style A: hangup on the double negative
- Card style B: likes language more
- Checkmarks mean what qualifies you, X marks what disqualifies you
- Preference: Prefers card style B, more clearly states that you qualified and the reasons why



#### Post-Task Interview
- No other feedback
- No thoughts about communicating eligibility information
- thinks too many links are harder to follow. The accordions compress the page and make it easier to read.

#### Additional Notes**
- Reconfirms consent for video clips
