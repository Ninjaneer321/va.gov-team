#### Introduction
- That’s okay (recording)
- That’s okay (clips)

[START RECORDING] 
- Yes (recording)
- That is fine (clips)


#### Warm-up Questions
- Never
- No
- TRICARE - we have TRICARE
- TRICARE is, well my husband saved in the Air Force, Tricare is for military. but now he is retired and we pay for TRICARE


#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Ok, so it looks like an introduction for CHAMPVA, an application for essentially medical care. It looks like for me, civilian not active duty. 
- I have never heard of it.
- Basically step by step for how to understanding, checking eligibility what you need for it. How long the application, after you apply
- Pretty step by step, I like that 
- Spouse, dependent or survivor .. reads intro paragraph.. 
- But it says certain requirements, not all, you will have to meet a certain criteria. I guess you would have to open up tab, right?
- Okay.. that’s a lot of information 
- I would have to see if I was eligible, but not 100% sure, it said in the prior screen certain criteria.. now I see (blue eligibility box)
- My quick understanding, your spouse has to be 100% or unfortunately passed away 
- If your spouse is not 100% disabled, if your spouse is 50% disabled, you don’t qualify. 
- I am assuming that they are going to ask you for your social security number to confirm that you are indeed a dependent of a military 
- I would think they would want some information there, even down to retirement date or something to that effect
- Well it is helpful to know they will check the eligibility, thinking they will do that
- I don’t know the whole process is and how they know what his eligibility is
- I don’t know how this process works 
- (mentions TN process of brining in letter/paper to county regularly) 
- I would try check my eligibility - something where I am entering in his social or my social

Wants to go through application process to confirm.

- (informed rating) based on this I feel pretty solid, I feel like its an 8
- I like that it is structured, laid out for somebody for me
- I personally hate visiting TRICARE website so much bombarded with information, tabs, 
- Gather your information, yourself, anyone applying my kids
- Would scroll down, what information am I gathering 
- like I thought, you would have to submit documents, I don’t know like current health?
- back to rating (a 5, pretty solid)


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Step 1 is eligibility, first we will ask questions - okay, that is what I want
- Okay, make sure I have is social written down. I don’t need his DD214, that’s great.

- re-reads last paragraph, Okay I guess
- Not sure what that last statement is about, I don’t know, don’t want to bombard the system 

- Okay that is cool, there is resources to help Veteran apply (somebody else radio option)

- I think that sometimes people can go through things really quick and overlook that Veteran’s name headline. Just off to be rush, or naturally seeing First name, I think Veterans name should be on input field 
- I think we are so robotic in our lives, we don’t read these
- Even me as a mom, I have put my name here when it was meant for my child. A silly mistake but it happens. 

- All of this stuff is easy and good

- Okay, based… I have to read it again, a lot of information.
- DEERS is where I am enrolled as a spouse.. 
- Even if you aren’t enrolled, you aren’t eligible for CHAMPVA
- So you could be eligible for TRICARE.. okay I had to really break it down in my head

- Um, I think it does what it does, it did what I thought it would. There is a system, DEERS, and I qualify as a dependent. This is saying what I am and am not eligible.
- This tells me, which is a little confusing. A little — am I or am I Not
? I don’t know 
- In this placement at this point is confusing to me
- Maybe before I started the process, this blanket statement here, before starting.
- Just because you qualify for TRICARE does not mean you are or are not qualify for CHAMPVA benefits

- I just feel like, you get to this point, should I go on? Do I go on? I guess I will see what happens next
- Just not great placement

- Yes (trusts information accurate)
- I would just hit continue to see what would happen next
- What else would I like to see.. I would just continue the application. Nothing additional. So maybe this little box, can be toward the end of my application, this might make somebody hesitant, but they haven’t made it through the dang application yet.
- That buffer or clarification, you are eligible for Tricare.
- It says may not 
- Before I do a deep dive on DEERS and look up his Tricare , but what I know for certainty he is 100% disabled. I would continue
- Yes he is in DEERS registered as 100% disabled, 
- This thing would have to be like decline, out the door, before I 

- ( seems to think only the disability rating impacts eligibility, doesn’t seem clear that it is one or the other but that DEERS is the system where the disability rating is kept??)

- I would still click continue 

- If you are at this point of life with the VA, you generally know

- For us, it would be yes. I have little kids, 
- I guess they are saying if you don’t have it you can check if you qualify for it.

- The x is the Veteran is not eligible for Tricare ???

- At a quick glance, the green check means yes. Which one can you identify with the green check or the red x. If you can say yes to the green check, … 
- According to this, yes (can get both TRICARE and CHAMPVA)
- Let’s say you were eligible it would be a green check , that yes he was 
- The red X says he wasn’t eligible for TRICARE and that is why there is a red X there
- That’s a really good questions - I don’t understand - but just because it says continue I am going to click continue 
- Maybe I answered a question that made me now eligible, I don’t know, maybe something needs to be submitted or clarified to be a go for me, I’m not sure
- This is wonky for me too, if you didn’t meet ALL, meaning if you didn’t get green checks across them all I need to exit
- I don’t know, two possible directions can go either way. Because of that will still continue 

- Does continue let me provide more application to see why this application is a go or tell me why

- I am going to give it a 1, not quite sure of the clarity or the message. I could go either way on this. Your summary or received message will be different .




#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE



#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- (reads through intro page, again calls out last paragraph)
- yeah, so I am a spouse this is correct

- This one is checked no, but we have it, I don’t know if that matters. 
- Just real quick, any, because some time half the family is, but it says any.

- So now I get green checks. SO now looking at this one, if I DON”T have TRICARE, then I am going to get a green check. 
- So I am assuming now, I read the previous one wrong, because it is saying I’m not eligible for Tricare. I guess you can’t have both.

- Nothing is making me second guess anything - all green all go’s 
- This one, I am confident, I didn’t get any red X, conditioned X and red means stop.

- So this one, it makes sense, I am saying 3 only because clarity has now hit me. If I had know and better read this, the first prototype would have made sense.
- In the end, this is user error here, being me.

- For me, they were both the same, no preference both the same

- Maybe in the eligibility requirements in the very beginning of this, before the application, but I don’t remember seeing anything that mentioned TRICARE. 
- Not in the very beginning, but it could have been an oversight on my part, but that needs to be plain and clear as being 100% disabled. You can’t double dip and get this and TRICARE.

- For me it was the same, it was just an aha moment for me on the TRICARE question. Not sure if it was an oversight on my part - needs to be just as important and highlighted before you start the application part of it

- Two different results and lack of understanding of TRICARE

- No, not at all! (Explain to friend) First go to information screen, get understanding of it
- Read about the program, what is it, 2 who is eligible that is really important, and then apply. I think eligibility is so important before that part of it. 




#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
Alert A
- So I would go back and make sure I entered in the correct information if that was a possibility
- If I can, sometimes when you hit submit it is gone into the wind, if I am able, would go back
- Even I couldn’t go back on it, I might want to do it again
- Yeah, it could have been me entering the wrong number


Alert B
- I would try again later
- because I wouldn’t want to hit continue if they couldn’t confirm his eligibility to begin with. 

Alert C
- Yeah, definitely I would just go back and make sure the information I entered was corded. I would just check to make sure, if it is correct, I would hit continue and see where that went. At the end of the day, eligibility has to be confirmed 


Alert D
- this is so confusing to me, I had to read it twice just to break it down in my head. 
- Found his information in DEERS that is good, so yes he is eligible for TRICARE. Just because we he whatever is eligible for TRICARE , does not automatically makes us eligible… 

- So.. if you are eligible for TRICARE, you are not eligible for CHAMPVA> I don’t like the wording, I have to re-read.
- Now I have to really deep dive, I would go to that website and ask the question… I just want to confirm just because he can get TRICARE he can’t get CHAMPVA something to that effect.t 


- Maybe a link or some kind of direction or better understanding of why not eligible. Put the link there I am going to look for it anyscnas 


- A 3, some of them would just recheck



Alert E
- Okay, so I would hit continue. Because green means go. 




#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
-  may be eligible, if you got these green checks
- okay, appreciate in that, plain and simple that’s what I needed to hear. If you do qualify for TRICARE you go over there. 

- The second card, says may NOT be eligible, and the difference is the Veteran or applicant is not.. wait a second what? I’m so confused. (Re reads the last bullet) What in the trickness is going on here? What?
- The x’s and checks I don’t even know what they mean anymore

- why am I getting an x here?

- This is very confusing to me, we are conditioned for these red and x and you think (but the sentence is the same)
- Same sentence, why am I getting two different 

- Okay, so the second one it says the response didn’t meet all the eligibility req - had to scroll real quick to try and see the difference

- I’m not even going to lie, I am totally confused, don’t know what I am looking at anymore.

- Reading it head to toe… 

- That is a little confusing, what is throwing me off is these differences. (On variations with a style)

- In any eligibility or any application, we are conditioned. Any green, means go and check mark meaning something has been completed. The red means this is the end for me, or not to proceed with the application . 


- I like the second set (B) the only reason I like the second set is because of these two lines right here (the intro paragraph) 

- That may not be is really like… I don’ know

- Your responses didn’t meet - this is black and white, (likes definitive response) 

- No, I don’t know I think it’s fine… I think I don’t know how important or not this is, in that card it should specify that they are 100% total and qualify 





#### Post-Task Interview
- No, I mean that anything military related, it should just be information that is easily accessible right there, a hyperlink to it or shortly down the page

- Why you are not eligible or whatever

- You have to literally deep dive Tricare.com to find answers and I hate that

- It should be clear, yes eligibility is met or not
- Before you apply it should be a solid understanding of what you are applying for
