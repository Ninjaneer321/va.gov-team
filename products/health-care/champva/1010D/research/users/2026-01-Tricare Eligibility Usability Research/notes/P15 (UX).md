#### Introduction
- Consents to screen and audio recording
- Consents to sharing of video clips

#### Warm-up Questions
- Has not applied to CHAMPVA in the past
- Has heard of CHAMPVA before
- CHAMPVA eligibility: does not know what the eligibility is, but knows that CHAMPVA is some sort of insurance.
- Difference between CHAMPVA and TRICARE: could not explain the difference between the two programs

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Using a tablet
- It's just info for CHAMPVA. It gives the prerequisites, who's eligibile, and it's for qualifying for health insurance through CHAMPVA. It says follow the steps, it has various links and so forth.
- Who's eligible to apply: reads the top content on the page, below the form name. Says that Veterans who meet certain criteria are eligible.
- Who's not eligible: myself, I am a spouse of a Veteran
- There's a backup that will double check my eligibility
- Nothing here that makes me uncertain about applying.
- I would like to know what types of benefits the CHAMPVA has. Give a little more what it does and does not cover. How the program works
- Rating: 5


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- I may complete this form on behalf of my dad, who's a 100% diabled Veteran. So I may click "I'm the Veteran" or the "I'm applying on behalf of someone else"
- Still seems to think this is a Veteran benefit, not just a family member benefit
- Veteran information: this is all straightforward. I assume if I went through the VA Apps that everything would be prefilled for me
- Eligibility check: I think it's great, it's saving time. It's telling me I may not be eligible for the benefits and the reasons why.
- Helpful
- Accurate? Yes. It says I'm already enrolled in TRICARE. It says if you're eligible for TRICARE you can't get CHAMP. It's one or the other, you can't be eligible for both.
- What I would do next: I would research in the VA App and look for information on TRICARE since it says I'm eligible for TRICARE
- I'd like to see a link to TRICARE so I can go straight into researching it.
- If this message was wrong: It would be helpful if there was another link that states "eligible or inegligible" and takes you to whichever choice you chose.
- I would stop my application here and get more information on TRICARE
- To me, the system is time saving here. Instead of applying and finding out at the end that I'm not eligible. I like that it comes almost immediately after checking your personal information (name, DOB and social)

- Would look at the additional info component for how service-connected disability is defined
- Eligibility for Tricare question: likes the link to check your eligibility on the TRICARE website
- CHAMPVA benefits eligibility summary: Identifies the checkmark and X. It's a summary of, based on my responses, for the CHAMPVA eligibility
- Reiterates she understands you cannot be eligible for CHAMPVA if you're eligible for TRICARE
- Next steps: If I didn't meet all the criteria, I'd exit the application. But notes that you can keep going if you think you may still be eligible
- Likes that you can keep going with the application without starting over
- Rating: 5


#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- On Veteran disability screen: I may be grasping at straws but perhaps there are situations where the Veteran is deemed 100% but expected to improve. So it's important to understand the difference there.
- Eligibility summary: Notes that applicants MAY be eligible based on responses.
- Because both items have green checks, I would proceed with the application
- Rating: 5, because compared to the other prototype, this one didn't have any red Xs indicating I couldn't continue. It's clear-cut that I'm eligible to proceed. 

- Prototype preference: blueberry, it's not confusing. Pineapple was confusing. It had one section where the family members were eligible, but there was a red X stating why they may not be eligible.
- Right amount of information
- Explaining to a friend: yes, I'd use the blueberry prototype though

#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Alert A: I would still apply if I saw this warning. I just need to go back and review the info that I completed about the Veteran
- Alert B: HMM! Perhaps if there was a link you could click on that would take you to the beginning of the CHAMPVA information. Perhaps there were errors made in the form. Once those were corrected, I'd be able to continue the application (sounds unsure). It's kind of confusing...either "try again later or continue." I really don't like the alert B. When I see try again later, is the app down? I think I would be frustrated if I tried to continue the app later and still come up with the same alert message. 
- Alert C: I would prefer that there was a link to take me backwards to review the information. Why wouldn't you go back and re-verify your information? There's no sense in clicking continue. It's a waste of time. It's saying that there's an error.
- Alert D: It's telling me the Veteran is enrolled in TRICARE and you can't have both. I would like a link for TRICARE benefits, and I'd click on that. 
- Alert E: This one has the check mark and is in green. I associate that with "go" to proceed. Whereas the other alerts have the triangle with the exclamation point which to me is "hey, read this." To stop and review the issues

- Confidence: 5, because it tells you whether you are eligible and for what program


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Talks through Card Style A, what each means
- Talks through Card Style B, what each means
- Preference for card style: Are they the same? I would say Card Style B because it states the eligibility criteria and why you may or may not be eligible (unclear). It's telling you that this is for CHAMPVA requirements. 



#### Post-Task Interview
- Any other feedback: No other feedback
- Preference for eligibility clarity: Yes, I have a preference to receive an email as the spouse stating whether or not I'm eligible and links so I can sign up for the benefit. 

#### Additional Notes**
- Confirms video clip consent
