#### Introduction
- Can record
- Can use clips
- 

#### Warm-up Questions
- Has not applied to champva
- has heard accronym but not sure about it. may have been mentioned in transition appts
- has heard of tricare
- tricare is standard for active duty and gives options for after.
- sounds like champva is for vets, maybe 100% disabled
- tircare = acitve, retirees, champva = served some service
- on a laptop
- has tricare now

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- standard va initial page for applying for a benefit
- form is for spouse dependent or survivor of vet who meets the criteria
- eligibility is for spouse, dep, or surivor or the vet themselves
- people shouldl click on champva eligibilty link, where he expects to have eligibilyt requirements explained more
- not uncertain - all VA pages have too much information, too repetitive
- because it's too crowded, he'd prefer a more streamlined (check your eligiblity, apply, what you'll need)
- he would continue in the application
- informed score: 4/5 - it gives you the info you need to at least be comfortable to move forward


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- no q when paging through
- based on initial info input, this person would be eligible
- unclear about if tricare disqualifies
- because it was "no" and it was preselected, hard to tell
- mentioned that if you weren't using tricare, so may not be clear that eligibility for tricare is a disqualifier even if not enrolled
- pretty confident in eligibiltiy at this point, would continue
- very easy to understand the screen 5/5



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- skimmed


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- no questions again for first two
- doesnt know what information they were making the decision call on
- not clear that tricare eligibilty is the deciding factor
- yellow box is not helpful and is confusing
- most vets would be curious why they dont meet the criteria
- doesn't trust the decision because they didnt belive they put in enough information
- would look to contact a help desk number to figure out why they weren't eligible or say that it's not correct
- feels like it's blocking - doesn't provide additional information
- wouold like a list of disqualifiers to determine if it's accurate or inaccurage on determination
- confused on answering yes, they are enrolled in tricare, but then the next page says "vet or applicant is not eigible for tricare"
- would reach out to tricare to see if there was a connection between the two programs
- would probably hard stop - knew that he didnt meet criteria
- 3/5 - fixed on the previous page saying they are eligible, but the next page says "net is not eligible"
- makes it clear tricare is the piece that nots working
- prefers the first (blueberry) because it lead him to believe he could continue, gave more details
- still thinks there's too much information - more streamlined - "less is more"
- shoud be clear - you are eligible or you're not eligible
- flow should be easier
- if you had to explain to a friend - yes, but caveat that it can come across as confusing and this particular program doesn't allow you to verify your information
- felt the first version allows for more information



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Alert a
- based on what he input, it can't verify, he needs to double check.  He would know to verify all the entered info (birthday, ssn, name)
- would check for typos
- woulnd't move forward, would still reach out directly
- alert b
- saying at this moment they coudlnt confirm right now
- hates these because he feels like it isn't ideal to have to come back
- he sets aside time to do the form at once, so would be hesitant to come back if he quit
- because of that, he'd lean toward continuing the application
- alert c
- same as a, would go back to check initial information entered.
- he personally would check tricare of champva, depending on who he thoguht caused the inability to apply
- if he had verified info as correct, he wouldnt move on with the form
- alert d
- if he was determining which benefit to use, he'd resort to tricare
- because it says that he has tricare eligiblity, he knows he's not eligible for champva, so would look to tricare for coverage
- alert e
- wouldnt want to see more info
- this message would be a good sign, he'd continue with form
- all alerts
- 4/5 it's not overly confusing what the information/action would be
- called out alert d mentioning deers and tricare more specifically
- none of the alerts are confusing, but the ones that say check back later are more frustrating
- 


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- top two are talking about being eligible for tricare
- bottom two are talking about being eligible for champva
- top one doesn't mention champva at all
- bottom mentions champva in both and mentions tricare as well
- because it references champva, the bottom two are more informative
- style be is easier to understand at a glance
- responses are not bolded, but still the biggest thing is the referencing champva 



#### Post-Task Interview
