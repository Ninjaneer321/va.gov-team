#### Introduction
- Consents to recording screen/audio
- Consents to sharing video clips

#### Warm-up Questions
- Has not applied to or heard about CHAMPVA before this morning
- I thought it was AI taking over for personnel, taking over processing of VA claims but I guess it's not that
- I've heard of TRICARE
- Is CHAMPVA not the same as TRICARE? It's different?
- I thought TRICARE was for active duty and Veterans, as far as the service member and their immediate family. CHAMPVA was just for the service member. That's not correct, but that's what I thought it was.
  
#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Sounds like it's for if the Veteran passes away, dependents have insurance (sounds unsure)
- It's for checking eligibility for the program (CHAMPVA)
- Who's eligible: dependents, spouse...I guess immediate family
- Yeah basically you can't have two insurances (meaning TRICARE and CHAMPVA at the same time)
- I'd click "find out if you're eligible"
- I expect that if you complete the form, someone can help you. It's kind of like contradicting (with the link). It says "find out if you're eligible" but then someone will help you when you complete the form. I think this needs to go above (the link)
- Uncertain: If you have TRICARE, will you lose your TRICARE if you apply for this? Or does this program have stuff the TRICARE program doesn't have? It's not giving me answers to that.
- I want more information (before I apply)
- Informed rating: 2 I'm not going to fill this out before I know more


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Eligibility for TRICARE screen: it says "how to check for TRICARE eligibility" so you know if you've got TRICARE or not. It seems like you should know if you're on TRICARE or not. It's hard not to know if you're not. You know if you're paying for it or not. I don't understand why that (additional info) is there.
- Eligibility summary: I'm not sure about that section, where it says "your responses." OK so based on my responses I got 2 green check marks, so that's telling me I'm eligible for CHAMPVA (confused). We're making sure we're eligible for TRICARE, right?
- I think I'm eligible for CHAMPVA because I got 2 green check marks.
- Confidence: I'm confident now that I know we're not checking TRICARE eligibility.
- I would hit continue (with the application)
- Rating: 4 it was easy



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- - Reads the alert: Ohhhhh, nice
- It definitely screens my eligibility by going into DEERS
- That alert is helpful, it lets me know I'm not eligible for the benefits quicker
- I would click continue just to see what's next. I want to know why it disqualified me.
- I would double check that my information was correct. If I got this alert again, then I'm not eligible. I'd talk to someone physically
- How do you know that the system is right?
- Summary of eligibility: Oh this is the same as before, right? 
- Is it accurate? I don't know. But this prototype is better because it checked DEERS.
- I would exit here, but in actuality I'd go back through my answers and check twice
- I'd also contact someone using the number at the bottom, to make sure.
- Rating: 5 because I understand it
- Prototype preference: Pineapple. It does the work for you, checking the DEERS.
- Amount of information: too little. Before you even get to putting in your Social, I want more background
- I could explain this to a friend



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Alert A: I would go back and check the information. If it was still wrong, I'd contact someone.
- Alert B: This alert is you can't find me. If I continue, how do I know that my application is going to get to someone if it's "not in the system"? I would contact someone. 
- Alert C: Hmmm, nope. I would check my information and then contact someone. 
- Alert D: I'd be contacting TRICARE about my benefits or to get information on why I have TRICARE and didn't know it
- Alert E: I would click continue

Confidence rating: 3

#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- These are all summaries of benefits eligibility information
- Prefers Card Style B: it tells you if you're eligible or not, if you met the requirements. Card Style A doesn't explain to me. It just says "your responses"



#### Post-Task Interview
- More feedback: I want more context to keep from hogging up the phone lines. A Q&A section
- What's more info about what the program's for, who can get it, etc. 

#### Additional Notes**
- Reconfirms video clip
