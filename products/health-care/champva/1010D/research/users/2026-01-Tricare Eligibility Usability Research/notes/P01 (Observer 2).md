#### Introduction
- Notes

#### Warm-up Questions
- Has heard of CHAMPVA but not totally familiar with the term
- Explaining diff between Tricare and CHAMPVA
     - Tricare is for Active Duty
     - CHAMPVA is for Veterans, not sure for 100% disabled

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- 1st page
     - Looks like a standard VA initial page that comes up if you were applying for a benefit
     - Believes the Veteran themselves could be eligible
     - Found link that would explain eligibility
     - Expectations are that once info is input, the system will tell you if you are eligible
- Confidence rating = 4
- General feedback
     - VA Pages are filled with so much info (sometimes repetitive)


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Walking thru the prototype
     - Understands based on data input,
     - Due to prototype prefill, uncertain if eligible for Tricare, whether they would be eligible for CHAMPVA
          - Assumes it might be different with different answers on previous screens
- Confidence rating on CHAMPVA eligibility = 5 (quite confident)
- Difficulty rating = 5 (pretty easy)


#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- N/A


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Walking thru the prototype
     - Not sure what data is being used as part of eligibility decision
     - Why am I not (or might not be) eligible?
     - Message is not helpful - confusing
     - Not confident in trusting the decision - all i put in was basic personal information, what is being used to determine I am not eligible?
     - Would find a contact number for CHAMPVA to validate eligibility
     - Would like to see some of the disqualifiers to help understand
     - The last page is confusing, especially with previous data input that someone is enrolled in Tricare
- Understandability Rating = 3 - confusing


#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Alert A
     - Would go back to verify data input
- Alert B
     - Doesn't like these kinds of messages
     - Frustrating, feels like it would be wasting their time
     - Would continue to apply
- Alert C
     - Same as Alert A - verify input
- Alert D
     - Understands that the system has returned info and what options remain
- Alert E
     - Would not need to see any further info, would continue with the application

- Confidence rating = 4
     - Appreciates Alert D and E


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Card Style A
     - Tricare eligiblity
- Card Style B
     - CHAMPVA eligibility
     - Would be more informative for the benefit I am applying for
     - Easier to understand at a glance
     - Referencing CHAMPVA is better and more clear

#### Post-Task Interview
- Could explain to a friend but would caveat confusing steps

#### Additional Notes**
- Too much info on the Intro page and applications
- Seems to have alot of info (summary page for example) - Streamline and direct (my word)
-
