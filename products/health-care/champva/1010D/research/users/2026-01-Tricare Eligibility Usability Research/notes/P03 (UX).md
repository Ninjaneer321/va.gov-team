#### Introduction
- Consents to screen/audio record
- Consents to video clips

#### Warm-up Questions
- Has not applied for CHAMPVA in the past
- Has heard of CHAMPVA - went through the Caregiver program, and CHAMPVA was offered to them at the same time. Ultimately decided not to participate in it because TRICARE for life offered better benefits.
- Has heard of TRICARE (has it)
- Difference between TRICARE and CHAMPVA: doesn’t really remember the difference. “Seemed like it was more convenient to stay with TRICARE than to do the CHAMPVA”


#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- "Apply for the CHAMPVA benefits"

- Who is eligible: Am I supposed to click on the link and open a new tab? (Goes to the static page and reads through it)
- (Participant does not seem to understand the question, after repeated attempts to probe)

- I would worry about my TRICARE for life benefits. I’m happy with those right now. I don’t know how much of a change it would be to apply for CHAMPVA or affect the way that I care for my husband. 

- I’m not sure if you have to pay for it (CHAMPVA) or what the extra benefits would be if I would switch (wants a way to compare the two benefits). 

- Informed rating: Well there’s a lot of places where I can go to find out more, should I want to and be ready to apply for it. 5. Easy to navigate. 



#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Summary: it just talks about what’s required and who’s eligible 

- Moderator asks: If you’re eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMPVA? That’s a good question. I’m not sure. I would like to know more information about that. 

- Moderator points out the green check marks, what does it mean to you? Well that I can check my responses and requirements against eligibility (for CHAMPVA). 

- What is the system telling you about your eligibility here? It shows the response to eligibility for CHAMPVA (nonsensical??)

- Do you think you’re eligible? Yes, I think so. It says that the Veteran is permanently disabled. (focuses on the first criteria)

- Confidence? Well this is a little tricky. I’m trying not to put my situation into the situation in the task/scenario. This one’s really hard. He has a permanent disability and he’s eligible for TRICARE…

- I would exit the application based on my confusion

- Comprehension rating: 1, it was hard for me to understand the eligibility. I was confused. 



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- I like that they checked my eligibility for me with the DEERS. It was helpful. I trust this information to be accurate. 

- Would you want to see anything else here in this message? I guess I’d like to know why I’m not eligible. More information. 

- If you thought this was incorrect, what would you do? I would just exit the application. I’d also go to the local VA office (like when I did the Caregiver program). I’d call them and ask, they have a lot of information. 

- The system is…helping me but I wanted to understand all my options before I let this application go. 

- P3 once again states she is confused by the scenario presenting different options from her RL state. 

Eligibility summary screen:

- She would continue (despite the screen saying not eligible). Well I’d know my eligibility requirements and I might think that I’m still eligible, I’d still continue. 

- Rating the prototype: 1 (very hard to project into the scenario and understand the eligibility)

- Preferences between the two prototypes: prototype pineapple
- Why? They both seem very similar. It made no difference. 

- Amount of information: About the right amount of information. But I’d continue on researching more about eligibility criteria, for more details. 

- Explaining to a friend: After I had researched and taken notes, yes (but not right now). 


#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Alert A: I’d go back and check that I entered my information correctly. 

- Alert B: I would not try again later. I’d continue to complete my application right now. 

- Alert C: I’d be concerned they can’t find my eligibility. I guess I’d select continue (sounds anxious). 

- Alert D: If they found all the information and I’m not eligible, that would be the end of the application (for me). I’d close out the application if I saw this message. Would like an “exit application” button. 

- All alerts: Nothing confusing/unclear to me. Just would be concerned if the Veteran’s information is not in the system and would want to find out why and how to fix it. 



#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Each card is giving a checklist and criteria for eligibility, based on the Veteran. 

- Prefers Card Style A
- Why? It’s pretty straightforward. It’s less wordy, easier to understand (more concise)
- The information provided is specific enough for me to understand how the Veteran and eligibility work. 



#### Post-Task Interview
- Any other feedback? It was hard to judge between the prototypes because they’re basically all the same, just worded slightly differently. It’s hard to tell which one I would go with. 

- Likes having an eligibility checklist to be able to tell if she’s eligible or not.
