#### Introduction
- Sure (screen and audio)
- Sure (video clips)

[RECORDING STARTED]
- yes (screen and audio)
- yes (clip)

#### Warm-up Questions
- No (never applied for CHAMPVA before)
- Yes (heard of CHAMPVA before)

- To my knowledge it is the civilian side of health insurance, if a Veteran spouse, it is an option we can use if we choose 

- Tricare - oh, yes!

- Yes - I believe that Tricare is the insurance you would use if you are still active duty, CHAMPVA comes when you are retired and not active duty in the military



#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- (scrolls through page)
- The page looks pretty familiar of what I know of these webpages for the VA, very standard in the way they have things laid out
- A starting point, checking eligibility , checking … (reads through headlines)

- Who is eligible to apply - retired or separated, a spouse who is deceased, be able to apply as a spouse to the Veteran.
- (reasons why) If you have already applied, if you are eligible for Tricare. I would gather that if you are eligible for Tricare you are not eligible for CHAMPVA because you are not out of the military.

- Checking your eligibility in step 1 and the link to open in a new tab

- Well it does make it sound it like we would be the person to check eligibility , some sort of AI tool or mechanism to check that, it does lead you to believe it is a human being who checks your eligibility. 


- When it gets to the gathering your information part - I might be hesitant if I didn’t have those documents ready to go, might be hesitant applying right then,
Personally yes, that is how I would always navigate these pages (check once, go gather and then go back to apply)

- [rating] Say a 3 out of 5
- So I think that it is a very helpful page what you need and eligibility but not giving anymore information about what goes into the insurance what to expect from CHAMPVA on the other side of this.
- What you get if you are eligible for, what you get
- Same as public sector if I was doing this like do for insurance 

#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- On this page alone, my eyes when to the Veteran’s DD214. And that another person and I would be like oh shoot, my eyes were drawn to that.

- okay… pretty straightforward (your information question)
- I am sure that social security number was listed on there, that is an important note that I would stope and be like make me want to make sure I have that

- (warning error)
- I think it’s fine, I am personally well aware that the VA system would have my husband’s information already into the system. I am confident that giving the information here it would be able to stop and check that he or myself is eligible or not.

- helpful is fine

- yeah (accurate)
- I would scroll up and make sure I filled out everything properly, and if it looked good on my end talk to my husband and have him get ahold of somebody at VA to find out what we aren’t eligible.

- If I was dead certain, I would continue with the application. If I had any doubt, I would not continue with the application 

- I would keep going (if believe system was wrong)
- It feels like it is helping me, the exclaimation sign and warning not a clear cut errr can’t go forward

- I don’t remember seeing that on the page before (permanently and totally disabled) that is a good drop down .. (additional info)


[Pattern eligibly review pagepage] 
- A summary of what you were just completing
- Restating how you answered the questions to show you why you don’t meet all the requirements
- And if you get an x up here you can leave the application 
- And if you receive green check marks you can move on
- Based on my understanding no (can’t get CHAMPVA if eligible for TRICARE)
- They got an x for that they would not be eligible for CHAMPVA?

- Me the prototype , no

- Confident 
- So at this point it is clear to me, if we are getting Tricare we can’t get CHAMPVA and I would be exiting the application 

- I would probably do a little more research, talk to my spouse about it if we are pretty certain we should be getting it.

- Pretty easy, 5


#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE



#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- So, with that first page, the answer being no and this second page, the answer being yes.. is that correct? Is that a mistake or is that done on purpose? (Glitch on prototype) 

- (gray box eligibility review page)
- I would take a different action, I am seeing this as you have a green light and can go ahead and continue. 

- [Rating of second] 5 - I think that having the green checks is important because it gives that added visual of yep, this is how you answered it and this would be that you are eligible. I see green checks, see my answer and good to go.

- Well interesting, they both seemed extremely similar. 

- About the right amount of information, up until this point, yes



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 

Alert A: 
- I think the alert is helpful, I would be worried and concerned if I came into this confident that my Veteran was in the system and I got the alert we couldn’t find in the system.
- Would be looking for who I could contact if I was certain they were in there, I would want to contact somebody. 
- I personally would not - I would want to - but I wouldn’t move forward with this kind of a warning 

Alert B:
- Yes I would (want to apply for benefits)
- It sounds more or less like it is a VA problem and not my own problem, if this was the alert I got I would continue moving forward and get as far as I can in the process and save for later.

Alert C:
(Waits for a few… ) It still to me sounds like it is a system problem, a VA side problem, same amount of confidence on this alert as alert b.
- Will continue and get as far as I can

Alert D:
- I think that this is good information, the explanation we found you in the system for Tricare and you can’t enroll in CHAMPVA, think that is necessary. I think that would be fine, to not have me move forward. I might ask somebody, but it does seem very clear to me I wouldn’t be eligible based on the information found in the system. 
- If I was certain I would then pursue speaking to somebody about that. If I was just coming into the system with no prior knowledge, this would be a clear enough sign that nope I’m not eligible . 

Alert E
- Nope this would be enough for me to move forward without applying 

A 5 - clarity of alerts

- I think that the alerts that have that first sentence that says can’t confirm eligible right now - sounds like a VA problem and not a you problem. 



#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Ah.. okay… 
- Each card is giving a summary to your responses and a visual for whether or not because of your response you are eligible for CHAMPVA. 
- So I think that the card style B was more straightfoward in that your response did not meet (calls out headline difference)
- I do think card style B is more straightforward and clear

- I think the only thing that I am drawn to is the last sentence on these, “The veteran or applicant is or is not eligible for Tracer” It can just feel harder to understand what the check mark and the x is in relation to that, it is not exactly what the person recorded as their response but it is the summary of it. 
- And this feels like typical VA verbiage up here, but the Veteran is eligible or not , like it is paradoxical, So you have to really understand what the summary is telling you, what you recorded below may be eligible yes green yes green, and not read too much into that last sentence. 

- If there was bolding around the meet or didn’t meet and like the Your eligible too - maybe a mix of them, a hybrid of the two would make that more clear.

#### Post-Task Interview
- no (any other feedback)
- I don’t think so, I tend to lean towards lists. I like when things are listed out, with the bullets. That is how I prefer to see it.
