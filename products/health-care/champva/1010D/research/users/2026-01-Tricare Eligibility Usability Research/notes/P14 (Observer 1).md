#### Introduction
- Of course (record screen and audio)
- Yeah, no problem (clips)

[START RECORDING]

- Yes (record)
- Yes (clips)



#### Warm-up Questions
- No *never applied
- Yes *heard of
- From my understanding it is for caregivers or family members of Veterans who don’t have access to any other kind of health care
- TRICARE is provided to military retirees but it is the active duty more so component for service members and families and can transfer over if retirement or medical retirement
- Some looking for CHAMPVA to fill gap 




#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- I like that it is numbered, that is helpful
- I like this disclaimer if you have already applied, don’t apply again I have heard from other caregivers specifically they have applied for something multiple times because they haven’t heard back
- Would check eligibility
- This note - eligible for TRICARE - this could be bolded. I assume if you click on this, it would be there, but make the TRICARE bold so people don’t waste their time.
- Helpful on gather information, nice to have live links out and checklist of things need
- I would expect there to be a start button here - step 3 
- Application for CHAMPVA
- I would have to click this to check - does this open?
- This is one of those VA things when there is a ton of eligibility requirements.
- I would read though this line by line - don’t want to waste time to apply for something not eligible for.
- So if you get TRICARE, again, you can’t get CHAMPVA. I think that is good that is noted a few times. 
- So these are all the different - would tell you the eligibility (accordion details at bottom of static page)
- Does surviving dependent child same as dependent spouse
- And again, if you have TRICARE you do not qualify 

- When you are filling out the form, like if you click yes I have TRICARE it would automatically stop the application. 
- At the moment it catches you not eligible, would stop you from completing the from

- I would not be eligible, because I do have TRICARE. At this point I don’t qualify for it, if you are a dependent child but if you age out of TRICARE, do you qualify for CHAMPVA, Might be some questions there. Would open all those gray tabs. 

- Would look for additional info before applying

- Knowing from experience of VA benefits, understands some have strict eligibility 

- [rating] I would say 5, pretty informed about what you are going to ned to do


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- So it says you won’t need to upload the Veterans DD214
- I feel like that is good to call that out - hold up a spot for somebody who is eligible for that benefit.

- Either or as self service or have the Veteran do it. Or somebody else all together, and other is that a VSO or case manager I’m guessing

- I like that it says finish the application later, like that I can go back. Noticed that already, that caught my eye

- People get nervous with sharing the social security number, I know that gets flagged in my community, how many times do I have to enter my SSN and didn’t the DOD do all this work to use DOD number?
- People nervous about Social Security - I saw ID me on previous page and I think a lot of people are more comfortable with that than sharing their Social Security number
- Veterans wondering why they can’t use their DOD number

- From some work in the survivor space - to the best of your knowledge has somebody died - I don’t know why that is rubbing me wrong. Being more sensitive to survivors, that question might hit a survivor in the wrong way.
- Would remove from the best of your knowledge 

- On here, you could answer to the best of that ability because people don’t always know rating or difference between permanent and total. This you could say answer to the best of your ability, but not the first one.

- (TRICARE) The people that have this. Definitely know. A lot of I don’t knows, there should be a way to check eligibility. 

- If I was a family member and I didn’t know, I would pause this application and save it up to here, and check eligibility on TRICARE website. Or select I don’t know and hope application figures it out for me.

- So it does give you the checkboxes back, if you didn’t meet you can exit.

- I am assuming it would have a red X if it wasn’t appropriate 

- I got two green marks, green checks, that I was a spouse of Veteran (PT) and wasn’t eligible for TRICARE which would make me eligible for CHAMPVA and could continue.
- (icon) the green check marks that I MAY be eligible 
- Yes
- Pretty confident in that understanding 
- Would continue the application because on that first page it said you will help me with my eligibility, and I got those two green checks, I made it through the eligibility and can continue on

- Only going to give it a 4 because it says MAY be eligible and it says if you are not you can stop here
- Someone my see YOU MAY not YOU ARE and the exit link could cause somebody to stop applying because that is not totally clear they are good to go forward


#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE



#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- I like that it says I don’t need to upload the Veteran’s DD214 but I’m wondering.. all ready I am thinking I don’t need to provide things like a date of service or social security 

- The 1 of 7 of eligibility I don’t know if it is going through those numbers properly

- When I see the social security number, I wonder why don’t they know this. Some hesitance here.

- So again, it is stopping you which is good, you don’t want to keep going.
- So this system is checking DEERS…
- One thing that would be helpful here, click here to figure out why you aren’t using TRICARE if you’re eligible for it

- So again, I know VA benefits are nuanced. But anytime you say MAY be eligible people will continue because they think there is an error. IF they are not using TRICARE or not using that, they might push forward because it says MAY.

- If this were me and I were applying, I would wish it would redirect me to TRICARE to get that figured out. Obviously I am here for health insurance and trying to figure that out

- No (doesn’t trust info accuracy) because it says MAY not be eligible, and it is not redirecting me to TRICARE to get that figured out

- Statement not definitive, would continue one. Wants links to access TRICARE if needed. 

- People only ever sign up for CHAMVPA because they don’t have access to any other insurance. If it is telling me I have insurance over there, would want to get there as soon as possible (TRICARE)

- Just to tie the bow on the would be send them to TRICARE to get that figured out - here is a number to call, that would be helpful.

- Not a definitive statement, keep going.

- Okay that does have (opens service-disability info component)
- That wording on the permanent and total - I would note you can see that on your rating letter. It’s not just 100% disabled and not expected to improve, but if you don’t have the P&T designation, it is important.
- The P&T I had the hardest time understanding at first, if you don’t have that noted, it is hard for people to understand. 

- Just a caregiver note on that, some conditions get worse, they happened on active duty but they are degenerative and they keep getting worse.
- This is going to be key to people hitting yes or no here.

- I know these are 1 or 7, these steps are helpful and appreciates that but thinks it is a prototype issue why it is not advancing.

- This is where I would finish this application later and find out (TRICARE)

- I love the green check… (reads line items)
- I read that as we are not eligible because of that X
- It kind of doesn’t make sense here too - you MAY not be eligible, and you can exit. Or you can continue..

- I would continue… here, I would probably still keep going. If you have access to TRICARE, don’t know why you would try and get CHAMPVA

- [rating] This one is a little bit more challenging, I feel like I understand the green check marks and red X, don’t know if my Veteran would know if he was filling that out
- The vague language, MAY not be, you CAN exit… 
- I would still go forward with this application, assume there is some error or wrong Veterans information, We don’t have TRICARE, we need CHAMPVA

- I would give this one a 3, harder to wrap around, Would still do the application but a bit wishy washy - go for it and hope for the best

- I did like that it linked out to DEERS, don’t know if DEERS is catching you over there. But if it can connect - DOD and VA, understand 
- Wants two systems linked together and talking systems especially with eligibility so people don’t clog up applications if not and streamline it for those who are and get it faster
- Yep - just saying make sure you don’t have any red x when you go through the 7 eligibility steps. And if you are eligible for TRICARE but for some reason not using it, go over there for more info.



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
Alert A
- Okay, so this happens to people all the time. This is why I think people push through.
The VA has the wrong birthdate in their for Veteran and is an issue to get worked out. 
- Would continue with the application, and hoping to find discrepancies. It is common for information to not be as accurate as you hope. Additional checks of Veteran’s record, especially if I knew name, DOB, SSN is correct and still getting this information I know he is a Veteran, keep going in application. 


Alert B
- I would complete my application here

Alert C
- Again, I read this as the eligibility tool can’t figure out who my Veteran is… if the information is correct, you can select Continue to complete application 
- If eligibility tool can’t find Veteran after double checked input, would continue 


Alert D
- Again with the non-definitive language. Very nuanced, 
- But that it says here, found Veteran’s information in DEERS, I would put that link to the TRICARE website there to figure out eligibility over there. 
- So here, get started with TRICARE, that would be helpful. And it would be great if when you go to that link, TRICARE was expecting you…


Alert E
- Yeah, you would keep going. The non-definitive language is what trips up a lot of people. I know you can’t say it, but it would be lovely if you could be more definitive. 

- Probably middle of the road here, again the non-definitive language. The color system is good, would want red in Alert D.
The yellow caution, the systems go down and people might keep trying and applying over and over again.
- Probably a 3




#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- So in this one (upper left) you MAY be eligible, you got your two green checks.
- The second, one I think that is a typo. You are eligible for TRICARE and therefore not eligible for .. it is the same sentence. I am expecting it to change based on my answer. I would expect this to say the Veteran IS eligible for TRICARE
- Double negative of TRICARE bullet is confusing 
- I read this you are not eligible for CHAMVPA this X and this is why (the text)

- I MAY be eligible 
- This sentence is helpful *intro on paragraph option B
- That helps
- That sentence is definitive, that’s a good one

- I would pick card style B, I like this sentence better, the better way to do it

- B easier to understand

- No (nothing unclear or confusing)



#### Post-Task Interview
- No I think the color coding and the icons, green check marks red X, are good indicators that you are going in the right direction or not eligible
- I saw the 1 through 7 steps, some people don’t want to do that, I already know I’m eligible can I skip it. 
- Some people might say that is a barrier they don’t want to do eligibly steps, just skip right to application.

- It says even if you are not using it, you are eligible so you are not eligible for CHAMPVA, I think there is a lot of issues there, hold Veteran’s hand between those. If they are eligible but not using it, what are their next steps to start using it. 

- yes (okay to share clips)


#### Additional Notes**
- The double negative and the red X on the eligibility summary card was confusing (for another participant) 
- The color coding and icons were appreciated throughout - both in the alerts and the icons as easy visuals when scanning - even if they were getting tripped up in the exact content. 
- The non-definitive language around the eligibility outcomes was called out as a negative and they mentioned wanting a connection to TRICARE for those who are eligible but not enrolled making it easier for them to get health coverage somewhere
