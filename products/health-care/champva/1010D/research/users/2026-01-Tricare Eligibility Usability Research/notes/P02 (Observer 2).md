#### Introduction
- Notes

#### Warm-up Questions
- Hasn't applied for CHAMPVA
- Heard the name CHAMPVA before, but not sure what it entails or what the details are
- Has heard of Tricare
- Thinks they are both cost-sharing like health insurance, but might differ in how much they cover
- Desktop
- Spouse of a veteran

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Looks like homepage
- Spouses, dependents, survivors are able to apply
- Might not be eligible if you're eligible for Tricare, though what exact details go into that I'm not sure
- Sees the hyperlink to learn more about who or who might not qualify for CHAMPVA.
- Seems like a fairly concise overview of application process
- I like how it tells you how long it might take
- I would want information on what exactly the benefits would look like (what CHAMPVA entails). I don't see anything that explains what CHAMPVA is... what really are the benefits
- How informed are you to begin the app? If I had all the background on the CHAMPVA benefits, related to the application process itself would give this page a 5


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- So far, all basic info
- Reads through the pages and the alert quickly
- "I love it, if I'm not eligible I would rather know up front and not waste my time going through a longer lengthier application"
- Helpful, not intrusive
- Like that the information is up front
- Trusts that the information is accurate
- Might be a case where it might find the Veteran's information in the DEERS system and.... (then trails off)
- If he thinks the alert is incorrect, then would look for a contact number
- Presses continue even though the prototype said he might not be eligible ... maybe because the moderator said "Ok, now you can continue"?
- Thrown off that it still says 1/7 but thinks it's because it's just a prototype. Had assumed the numbers represented the page he was on, not the section
- Likes that there's another Tricare page, to double-check in case the DEERS alert is inaccurate
- Thinks the grey eligibility summary is confusing
- "I don't fully understand from what point of view the check means" Does check mean good and the X mean not eligible?
- Confused by the double negative about Tricare eligibility
- Asked: If you're eligible for Tricare can you still get CHAMPVA? Answers: No
- I don't know if the X means good or bad in this case. I would have thought that if that's your response (the sentence "The Veteran or applicants is not eligible for TRICARE"), then that would be a good thing. **Seems to think that the sentences within the grey eligibility boxes are based on what ever the applicant filled out, as opposed to the general rules of eligiblity**
- 50/50 about this page
- I would continue the application but I would have some doubt

#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Looks to say if anything is different, seems the same

#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Notices that there isn't the alert popping up like in the previous prototype
- In this case, we said no, the applicant is not eligible for Tricare
- Difficulty: essentially the same prototype, would give it a 5. **This is easier to understand just because both options are greenlighted.**
- I feel like the prototypes were both the same except the results are different.
- **I would rather use Pineapple (to see the alert).**
- Just the right amount of information

#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- A, B, C you just can't find the applicant at all. Not just in DEERS, can't find the Veteran in the VA's system. **Would assume it's a system error**
- D we can find the application in DEERS and they're likely not eligible. Would probably still proceed in the application. "I would like to see the hyperlink to the DEERS" **assumes the hyperlink on the intro page would let you check your info in DEERS**
- E we've confirmed the veteran's information **but we can't find you in DEERS** so you should still apply

- A, B, C not sure if the you just couldn't find the applicant in DEERS or couldn't find them at all

- Would give all 5 alerts a 4

#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Likes card style B much better
- This clears up all the confusion

#### Post-Task Interview
- Like that it's upfront
- The way it's presented now is good, just polishing up the wording to make sure there's no confusion (referring to the grey eligibility card it seems)
