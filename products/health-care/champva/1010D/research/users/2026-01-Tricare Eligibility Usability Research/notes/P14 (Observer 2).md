#### Introduction
- Laptop

#### Warm-up Questions
- Never applied for CHAMPVA, but knows what it is. For caregivers that don't have insurance.
- Tricare is provided to military retires, more so active duty medical insurance, Not everyone has access to TRICARE after service.

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [X] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Likes that it's numbered its helpful. Good instruction covering not to reapply. Doing so can slow he process down.
- If you are eligible for Tricare could be bolded - ensuring people with TRICARE don't waste time applying.
- Likes to have a checklist of things. Finds the links helpful.
- This application is to apply for CHAMPVA. Unsure who is eligible. Oh this is one of those VA things that has a list of requirements.
- If you get TRICARE you cannot get CHAMPVA. User reads the Eligibility requirements.
- User determines they are not eligible. There was some grey area for aged out as a dependent child. I would look for additional information before applying.
- **Rating 5** - I feel pretty informed about you're going to do.



#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Likes that finish this application later to come back and complete. Frustrating to come back and have to redo information when completing a form.
- Questions SSN. Thought this shouldn't be required, particularly if using a DOD # or ID.ME
- Remove "Answer to the best of your knowledge," need to be more sensitive to a survivor. 
- Some people to totally understand total and permanently disable. Have to the best of your knowledge would be ok in this instance.
- Would save the application and go check Tricare eligibility before proceeding.
- You get the checkboxes. Two green checkboxes, meaning I am eligible, Would assume a red X if I wasn't. User believes they are eligible and confident they can proceed.
- **Rating 4** - you may be eligible. Doesnt say you are. The you can proceed button causes a little confusion.


#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [X] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Love they have the finish the application later.
- SSN - why do they need this.
- It's dropping you which is good so you dont keep going. One thing that would helpful. If you may be eligibile for tricare, provide a means to check.
- Anytime you say "MAY not be eligible" Leaves room for ambiguity if they are or are not eligible for CHAMPVA.
- Does not feel the information is helpful. They don't trust the information and would continue with the application.
- People only sign up for CHAMPVA because they don't have access to any other insurance.
- Helpful they found the Veterans info in DEERS.
- There was some feedback around the PNT not being on their record. This can be difficult to understand. You can be 100% disable and providers state is isn't getting better, but you still don't have the rating.
- How you define service connected disability and PNT is critical to define clearly.
- The X is there, so I read this that the Veteran does not qualify. Points again to ambiguity around the statement "you may".
- **Rating 3** - This one is a little more challenging. I understand, but my Veteran may not. and VA benefits are very nuanced. Would still do application but would proceed anyhow.


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- I liked that it linked out to DEERS, I know there is not a lot of DOD and VA connection.
- Would be lovely if these systems could talk to one another and get people insurance faster.
- Yes confident they could explain to a friend.



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- **Alert A** - This happens all the time and why people push through. If the suer were to go back and redo the information and get this same alert would be frustrating. Common for info not to be accurate - but would keep going if t hey know the info was correct.
- **Alert B** - I would complete my application.
- **Alert C** - If the error is the eligibility too cant find the veteran, you will still proceed, because you know their info is correct.
- **Alert D** - Would put the link to Tricare opposed to just saying you are eligible for Tricare. To visit Triceare. Saw you were applying for ChampVA. Good sound bite.
- **Alert E**
- **Rating 3** - Non definitive language.  


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- **Card style A** - Wording is throwing the user off, here it's yes and here it's not. I would expect it to say the are eligible for tricare. Double negative.
- **Card style B** - User missed the sentence, but on redirect, indicated the sentence was helpful. The sentence is definitive, and is helpful. Would choose Card B.
- Would like a link to TRICARE on card b



#### Post-Task Interview
- The colors are helpful. Yellow for caution.
- Some people may want to do eligibility screeners and and some are sure they are eligible and wouldnt want to be bothered in having to complete the task and just apply.

#### KEy Take-aways**
1. Speak in definitive statements removing ambiguity, and eliminate double negatives.
2. Be sensitive removing to the best of your knowledge.
3. Ability to save and return to finish application is desirable.
4. Would like better connectivity between DOD and VA systems to facilitate smoother access to benefits.
5. Statement on Card style B was helpful in understanding eligibility (user did initially miss the sentence though). Desires an actionable link to Tricare and a seamless departure from CHAMPVA to get enrolled in TRICARE if not CHAMPVA eligible.
