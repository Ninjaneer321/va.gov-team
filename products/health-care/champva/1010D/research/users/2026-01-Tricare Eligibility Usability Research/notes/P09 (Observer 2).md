#### Introduction
- Yes (recordings) 
- Yes (video clips)

[ Starts or recording] 
- Yes 
- Yes


#### Warm-up Questions
- No mam  (never applied)
- I have, yes

- (eligibility) Man that is a great question, I retired in 2019 and I am 100% and getting Tricare. It seems like with where I was with Tricare, it seems like a better option

- (difference) Tricare you go go civilian doctors and CHAMPVA you go to VA facilities 
- Because of the VA service disabled that 
- I am on Tricare Select, but I pay a little bit of pocket but it is not so bad

(Screen frozen… pause )


#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- This looks familiar, kind of what I rememberer. I have 3 kids, always trying to look for the best health options.
- Tricare - you can’t get CHMPVA benefits, I didn’t know that honestly
- Well, like most things at the VA that’s a lot of stuff
- I do remember - it seems like signing in and getting an account, the DSLogin, gets very confusing across a lot of websites. That GUI, that user interface is just… kind of what, 
- Very well done and has the links to what I want especially the eligibility upfront
- Medical benefits for dependents, spouses and children
- Number 1 there, check your eligibility 

- Um… that’s interesting (check eligibility sentence call out) I don’t know are they using AI are they just checkboxes within the form, I think that would determine and not waste my time. I find that interesting.
- I guess if you are questioning if you are eligible, 50 50 on the fence, something else is going to back that up for you
- I can see the benefit of that
- For me personally — yeah being eligible for Tricare, as a retiree of 20 years eligible for Tricare. 

- If I saw that today, I’m not applying. I don’t remember applying for CHAMPVA but also don’t remember seeing that.

- I would probably want a phone number IF I wasn’t going to be on hold for 30 minutes. If it could be, hey, quick question.
- More of an up front - tell me my situation 

- This page I would put it , but no phone number, this is very well done. How amplify some key words, and or’s are huge. Emphasizing those words, using the lists. Military we love lists, break down 
Links are huge, redirecting me to that information so not having to Google it on the side
- So 4.8
- I put this at a 5, rounding up 


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- (goes through questions, clicking continue)
Eligibility summary page
- based on my input, I would be eligible for CHAMPVA, by spouse and dependents
- No - (can’t be eligible for TRICARE)
- They mean you are good to go, green check good, red X no good.
- That I am eligible, see green checks down the side, MAY be eligible, kind of overlooked that 
- (confident) I would be pretty, again simple guy, if I see green checks based on my input I would be pretty confident
- I would continue
- Very easy, 5



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE



#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- I like that you mention I don’t have to find my DD214, that’s always nice
- Whenever I am at the VA and I see that DD214, I think how can you guys not have it. Have sent it hundreds of times.

- (alert) Well its good, it automatically checked it through the DEERS systems, know that system well from many years ago
- Nice that it automatically verified, every Vet is going to understand the DEERS system
- Or if you think you are eligible for CHAMPVA you have a lot of work to do
- It answered the question if I didn’t know I was eligible - I would make an appointment at the ID office and they can verify and adjust your DEERS

- No, very helpful. Just kind of save me the time if I wasn’t certain of my Tricare eligibility or CHAMPVA eligibility I was going through a few years back
- well, I do, there will always going to be 
- Do I trust it, but it is going to be 95% accurate, there will be those poor souls that are going to have to go and make some calls

- For me, I would click the red x up in the corner and go back to day-drinking, kidding ;) 
- Then I would go apply for TRICARE
- Great question - a phone number, or right here I am stuck, who do I call… if you don’t think you are eligible for DEERS here is a link to all the ID offices to make an appointment … it’s not a hard thing, making that online appointment 
- Most folks are going to be near some military base or national guard center, near VA they are going to be able to make those contacts 
- A link, absolutely
- A phone number or link if you have questions about your DEERS status, here’s info for that, something along those lines, that’s my suggestion
- Or a VA contact number, link and such

- I’m kind of stuck here so a couple of vectors would be nice, At this point it is a block it is not providing any sort of options here. 


- If I were to see this I would probably want to contact my DEERS 
- Again a big how to check for TRICARE eligibility - 
- I would have used that back there as well, not bad here . If I had that link earlier you would have just saved me a step.

- The red X is always bad, never a good thing, especially when you are flying planes. At this point I would know I am not eligible.

- It depends how strongly I felt about my eligibility in DEERS - but again, words mean things, I guess MAY. Your personal situation, there is a waiver for everything as we say in the military.
- I would stop at this point 
- just as easy what did I say last time, a 5
- Subtle differences but if I had to choose I would choose this one
- I think there is a good 
- You can’t overwhelm them with information or they are just going to shut down. What I have seen with the VA those big blue buttons
- The right amount of information and have to provide the right info
- You guys have determined in through DEERS and that is a huge step

- Even if, you may not be eligible, you can continue 
- Predetermenation 

#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 

Alert A
- That is a very frustrating alert, you have to check your information. I get that and my information is correct and I am stuck in a loop.
(Seen before and frustrated)

Alert B
- Same thoughts is this a server issue or it certainly be understandable
(Close out and come back)
- Difference is because we can’t find this one tells me that they can’t even get into the server.

Alert C
- Goes back to my first one on Alert A
- If it let me continue, I would just continue it 
- Alert to stop or more of a notice
