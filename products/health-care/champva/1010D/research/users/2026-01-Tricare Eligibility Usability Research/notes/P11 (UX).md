#### Introduction
- Yes
- Yes 

[ STARTS RECORDING ] 
- Yes
- Yes

#### Warm-up Questions
- No
- No
- Yes (heard of TRICARE)
- (tricare) Insurance they offer to Veterans and their families


#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- (quietly reads through page)
- So it looks like an application for health insurance
- The spouse, dependents and survivors
- If you applied for TRICARE (why they might not be eligible)
- Would go to check you eligibility link 

- The in case you still are not sure, there is a second step to check if you qualify.

- (uncertain about applying) I guess they don’t explain what makes you qualify for CHAMPVA
- Probably what makes you eligible on the side and you could see if it is worth your time to apply
- Like a link saying what are your qualifications (didn’t call out link to that info)
- {rating} Feel like its a 4, tells you what you are applying for and the steps to follow, 1,2, 3 steps
- (make it a 5) A little more explanation on the CHAMPVA itself


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- It doesn’t really explain what makes you eligible 
- I like that they started with the Veteran’s because some people put their own information first - would make Veteran’s name bigger too
- This is very simple, understandable
- I like that there are not too many on the page (questions)
- I think, I like that it has a little popup and you can check your eligibility (TRICARE page)

- The Veteran is not eligible for TRICARE (eligibility summary page meaning)
- Yes (can get TRICARE and CHAMPVA)
- Because the first page said if you are eligible for TRICARE you’re not for CHAMPVA - 
- I would still continue
- It looks like it was correct when I see it (green check marks)
- That I would assume I was eligible…Because it’s green 
- Not very confident - why this person is eligible not just check marks 

- [rating] this screen? Like a 2… because I think I am eligible but I didn’t read it (not quite sure and not confident in information)


#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE



#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- ok, same as the last one
- Did I click something (when the warning alert showed up)
- (eligibility check here) would probably stop you from continuing further
- I don’t think it’s intrusive - it’s just off. Right away
- It tells you right up front instead of going further - I feel like they should explain why. Maybe like a chat service (wants contact information)

- No maybe it’s a special case (does not trust accuracy of alert)
- Would contact somebody in person 

- Probably like an another form to ask for another person’s opinion on whether or you are eligible or not. (A contact form of some sort)

- I would (continue anyways) In case it was wrong, still have an application 

- Feels like they are blocking.  Because it doesn’t explain 


- Okay now it makes sense, not it looks like I am not eligible because I see a red x
- I would probably stop and exit the application and call somebody directly 

- [rating] I think the second one was more, it’s ….. it kind of told you were an eligible right away but it made it hard to find out why. Wanted a way to contact somebody else.
- [Rating] compared to the first one, probably a 5
- It gave me my eligibility right away

- Probably the second one (Pineapple preferred)

- Only because I wasn’t familiar with CHAMPVA, but after reading it, it does have that right amount of information and per page. Wasn’t overwhelming per page.

- Yes ((confident in explaining to a friend)



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 

Alert A
- I would probably resubmit the application, and then follow up with an in person or a call

Alert B
- I feel like the page is down, that is probably why they gave that message. Or an error with the page. I would wait for later then reapply again. 

Alert C
- um.. probably resubmit my application again and do the same as A, follow up with a person.

Alert D
- Sorry, that is really confusing. Okay, so the online information in DEERS for Tricare.. I’m not eligible because I am eligible for TRICARE I guess.. That makes sense. 
- Probably follow up with a person and pause application 
- wants a way to contact somebody
- Maybe a link or contact information 

Alert E
- I like that they made it green, very clear
- Continue


- [rating] 5 maybe

- Maybe if they made this area check marks, like an x here (alert D)

- Some people just visualize things better than reading 


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- One of them — between A and B or …

- card 1 ; based on the check marks the person is eligible for CHAMPVA
- And the second one they are not eligible because of the TRICARE

Card style B
- I think this part is more clear compared to part A (calls out the header and intro sentence)
- B easier to understand at a glance 

- No I don’t think so (nothing on cards confusing)



#### Post-Task Interview
- maybe like a … no I don’t think so
- Just clear, like button and click
- A follow up contact information 
- A chat service would be helpful 


- Yes (sharing clips)
