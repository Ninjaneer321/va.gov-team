#### Introduction
- that’s fine (record screen and audio)
- okay

[recording started]
- ok
- yes okay


#### Warm-up Questions
- No I have not (ever applied for CHAMPVA)
- Yes (have heard of it before)
- Well when I went through the caregiver program with my husband, that was offered to us. We choose not to participate in that because my TRICARE for life offered better benefits.
- Having to go back awhile, no, I don’t remember I know I get all of my medications through Tricare through life. I can’t remember exactly why, just seemed more convenient for me to stay with the Tricare


- Sometimes I have difficulty with that (technology verse)

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Ok, can you scroll up … 
- Applying for the CHAMPVA benefits and what documents I need
- Am I supposed to go to the blue Find out if I’m eligible blue opens in a new tab or something .. (moderator clicks on link to benefits static page)
- Okay…
- (eligible to apply question) (quietly thinking…)
- Okay, No I have not applied for CHAMPVA benefits 

- I guess the think I would worry about is my TRICARE life benefits. I don’t know how much of a change it would be if I went to CHAMPVA benefits and how I take care of my husband
- No incentive to apply for CHAMPVA
- Not sure if you have to pay for it, or what the extra benefits would be if I switched

- (rating) Well there is a lot of places I can go to find out more if I want to and be ready to apply for it
- It looks like it is very easy to navigate, so a 5


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Okay, yes continue
- Like I said I feel bad (would not really be applying for CHAMPVA in real life, would stick with Tricare for life)

- The first one, I’m a spouse
- Yes my husband is permanently and totally disabled, (expectation to change answer) 
- Yes
(Reading and answering questions as they would for real)
- He is in the TRICARE so the answer would be yes (yes, … laughs okay)

Eligibility pattern screen 
- Yes I read it
- Well it just talks about the information who’s eligible to meet the requirements for CHAMPVA benefits
- (eligible to Tricare still get CHAMPVA questions) now say that again… that’s a good question. Yes I would like to know the information about that. (Unsure)

- well that I can check my responses and check my requirements, check the eligibility (the green check marks)
- the response shows the eligible for CHAMPVA
- Yes I’m eligible, well it says Veteran is permanently disabled the first one
- Yes I would be eligible checking the first response
- Well this one is a little tricky to me


- I am having a hard time with it
- I know he has a permanent disability and he is eligible for Tricare, that is the part I’m not sure of
- Maybe this screen is telling you the opposite of your situation
- I probably would (exit application at this point)
- Well I would have to put it at a number 4 - it was hard for me to project what the eligibility would be (moderator reset rating scale) - well in that case I would have to do a number 1, it was very hard
- Yes
