#### Introduction
- yeah
- yes, that’s fine I don’t care (recording clips)

[Recording Starts]

- yea that’s fine (recording screen audio)
- yes (recording clips)



#### Warm-up Questions
- No I have not
- I have my mother uses it with her husband
- So from what I’m tracking you are only eligible for it if you are 100% permanent and total and permanent and total and TIU and not permanent and total. 
- Yes, of course (heard of Tricare)
- I wish I could give you an honest answer of that, only tell you what I think I know of it
- Tricare is just the insurance that works, does everything, primary insurance
- Secondary insurance is CHAMPVA and it works with your existing insurance as a back up 
- If I was on an employee insurance policy, and my disability rating goes to 100, I can’t discard my current insurance and only go CHAMPVA



#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- So this looks like the standard VA website, basically it goes over CHAMPVA and how to apply for it if you’re the spouse. This looks like something for the dependents to apply for CHAMPVA not necessarily the Veteran

- This will tell me if I’m eligible or if my dependent is eligible
- What documents I need, can click on link to find out what documents

- Eligible applicants are families, dependents of Veterans who are considered 100% permanent and total , … yeah 

- It’s all pretty straight forward - I could click on links for more information, find out what documents I need

- I would click sign in and or have my wife sign in to her account, probably check eligibility first and make sure I had all my documents then I would start my application

- Shows everything, eligibility for groups, how to apply for benefits there is a typo.. not what this is for I have OCD so that would irritate me

- Here is the primary eligibility information, (blue box)
- The only thing it doesn’t tell you is what that VA eligibility is, if you have to be TDIC or 100% permanent and total - it is a subtle difference. 
- But if somebody didn’t know because they are not education in decision letters, they could get there information here and then apply

- {Rating} 4.5, yeah strong 4
- It has everything on there except for, it does have the link, it doesn’t go into what your ratings have to be to qualify, but gives you access.
- If the information was on this page, I would give it a 5
- Instead of looking at a page to look at another page and another page - just put it on there

- (goes over subtle differences in disability rating)

#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Okay, so the first thing it is going to do is check your eligibility for CHAMPVA, or the dependent is - it seems all of this here is speaking to the dependent and not the Veteran
- Basically saying if you don’t qualify don’t apply because you are going to add more problems to the pipeline


- this is the first time I am seeing from the Veteran perspective (who are you question)
- Pretty staight forward

- Oh it says no, you are not eligible
- Basically it is saying this Veteran doesn’t have any dependents eligible because they are in DEERS and enrolled in Tricare.

- Um.. it is informative, it is not intrusive or anything 
- I am used to VA’s organization 
- The orange is the colors version of yelling at you, not red so not shouting at me, but it is saying hey maybe change it from orange to yellow, definitely not green because green means go

- The orange is very bold and stands out

- Yes (trust information as accurate)
- I would click continue - it doesn’t give me any other option, I could go back to the previous page
- I wouldn’t save it for later - I don’t need to do that
- I would click continue to see what the next page told me, out of curiosity would click continue to see what would happen next
- Maybe click “ok” or “close” or something like that
- But from here where it tells me I am not eligible, I want to click continue to see what would happen next
- Yea, instead of finish the application later, that should be gone, and something thank you for your time
- Would not see finish app or continue links/buttons, if it is saying I am not eligible but you can do this later if you like to find out you are not eligible.

- (incorrect info) I don’t know, it says even if you are not enrolled if you are eligible - I would maybe call my VSO

- If you disagree with this press continue or call 800… what if I’m not in Tricare, there is nothing I can do.

- It doesn’t explain why or give me the option to disagree with it or contact somebody to see what my next step would be. 

- Right now it is blocking me from applying and I understand what it is saying about my eligibility, but if I disagree with it, I don’t see what my options would be. What if this information is wrong?, I’m stuck. 

(Questions in eligibility info section)

- ok, so it looks like they are eligible for Tricare and I can check to see if they are eligible, so I guess clicking continue puts me in the next step and explain why and give me more information

(Pattern page)

- So if they are eligible for Tricare, they don’t qualify 
- At this point if I knew that to be true, I would exit the application, if I disagreed with that, I would click continue 

- It basically breaks it down hey you have met this connection but there is another connection you did not meet because you are not eligible for Tricare.

- (icon in gray box) out of these 3 requirements I meet the one with the check mark, I don’t think the Veteran died because earlier the Veteran was the self doing the application. Letting the Veteran know they met this requirement but they don’t meet this requirement (red x)

- Well if I was Riley Smith I would exit the application or if I disagreed and my dependents were not in Tricare,  I would click continue 

- (rating) I’m pretty confident it is pretty straightforward, the previous pages left open questions but this page answers that

- If I agree I can exit, if I know this to be untrue can still continue with the application

- 5 it was super easy

#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- All pretty much the same as it was before
- Veteran applying for benefits for spouse or dependents or both
- No, not enrolled in Tricare, I can check eligibility and click continue 

- So Riley is permanent and total disabled and him and his dependents do not qualify for 
- If you have green checks all the way across go ahead and continue 

- (rating) um 5, very easily
- It seems like it has less continues 

- Prefer to use the Blueberry - it was faster I guess. Once it imported the Veterans information and answered the questions, go right into the application
- Feels like there was an additional one or two pages to continue, could be wrong, feels simpler 
- The orange message.. I like this one better. 
- I think it is more direct, not giving me excess information 

- Knowing what I know now about the two - the Pineapple the extra alert message some time we obsess over details, so having an additional screen with additional information that is also found on this page. I think (blueberry) is much better because it has the right amount of information without having to double down on the information

- Yes, 


#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 

Alert A
- So if I put my information in and got this message - I assume the VA didn’t have my DD214 or I wasn’t registered for an account but I am signed in. I would assume the VA is missing some service information from my service.
- I would want to fix the warning, so if they couldn’t find my information I would probably call the 800 number and want to know what’s missing.
- Let me know what’s missing
- That’s what I came to the website to do is resolve something, if I get an alert I would like to resolve it.

Alet B
- I would.. I would probably click continue and then I would give it a couple of days and then call. This tells me there might be something wrong with the VA portal.

Alert C
- I would check my information. This message is a little different than the first one, maybe I put in my information wrong or messed up on social. I would double check .
- Call the VA (if double check and still getting alert)

Alert D
- If I was enrolled in Tricare, I would be well that’s that. I would know whether or not if they getting Tricare. Nobody would not know - unless they are a child - that they are on Tricare for primary insurance.

- If an error on VA side, want a path to correct. If message is accurate, good with it.

Alert E

- It’s green , green means go. Would click continue. 


- Very confident. 
- {rating} 5


- No (unclear alerts) um.. (alert A) I think if they can’t find the information in the system, and I knew the information is correct, I want to know what the next step is. Want that instruction.


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- They look very similar to me…
- So this one I got double green checks, telling me Veteran meets requirement for permanent and total and not eligible for Tricare


- This second one, the Veteran is permanent and total, but their dependents are eligible for Tricare. 

- I see… the second one has the additional headline “Your responses met” 
- To me it is saying, concrete proceed 

- Like that extra detail in the content headlines  



#### Post-Task Interview
- Uh no, I like both of them. I think the Blueberry one I liked better didn’t have double information, seemed smoother and cleaner.
- And adding that little blurb on Card B, that is an important little piece. Especially for older Veterans reading every line, be clear and precise. 

- (eligibility clarity) I like the green checks and the red x - if it says you are not eligible for this reason. 


#### Additional Notes**
- Yea (confirm ok with sharing clips)
