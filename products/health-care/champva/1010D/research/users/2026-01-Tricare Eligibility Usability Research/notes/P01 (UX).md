#### Introduction
- Yes, that’s fine (okay with recording screen and audio)
- Yes, that’s fine as well (okay to use clip)


#### Warm-up Questions
- I have not (ever applied for CHAMPVA)
- The acronym sounds familiar, may have mentioned it at appointments
- Yes (heard of TRICARE)
- If if is TRICARE standard or TRICARE in general is what active military get and retire
- It sounds like CHAMP is specific to Veterans, not sure if it is only 100% disabled
- My understanding TRICARE is active duty and retirees, and CHAMPVA just Veterans who were at one point in the military

- On a laptop 





#### First Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- It looks like a standard VA initial page, that you would come to if you were applying for a benefit, this benefit is for CHAMPVA

- spouse or dependent of service member, surviving  
- (eligible to apply) Eligibility would be the spouse or dependent

- calls out Find out link in step 1 as where most people would click and go
- I guess once you go through inputting your information, the system will tell you whether or not you are eligible 

- (uncertain about applying) No, I wouldn’t say any uncertainties. All the VA pages have too much information. A lot of information. All the VA pages crowd it with a lot of information.
I would prefer something that says check your eligibility and apply and make something along the lines of what you need to apply

- I would probably just continue with the application

- RATING] - I would say 4, it gives you the information you need to move forward and whether or not you are eligible 


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- ok, keep clicking continue ?
- (clicks through all continues quietly)

- (eligibility box) base on the initial information I input into the system, I am eligible for the CHAMPVA benefits

- Um - I am not certain, it was already selected, If the information was changed maybe it would give you different information 

- I guess if we hit yes (tricare question) it may say you are not eligible or need additional information

- (green checks) those are the requirements for eligibility - that you are totally disabled and not eligible for TRICARE

- That I am eligible 

- On that scale of 1-5, 5 at this point (confident would be eligible) 

- I would go to continue 

- 5, it was pretty easy, self explanatory 




#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE


#### Fourth Task: ELIGIBILITY 
- I feel like what information it was making a decision on the information that is in here is just my name, date of birth
The last page had questions that let up to the eligiblity decision 
When you saw the system refreshing or thinking - at this point I would be thinking why am I not eligible?

- Certainly not helpful, it is confusing
Most Veterans thinking, why do I not meet the criteria

- I am thinking , what information is it basing the decision on. It is your basic personal information. I would say no

- (not eligible) I would try and find some sort of help desk number, find some contact number for CHAMPVA, an email address or something along those lines
- I attempted to apply and I think I am eligible but it says I am not eligible, how do I find out that information

- It’s blocking me from applying
- It doesn’t provide any additional information, if it is saying bad on the Veterans information another link or pop up that lists some of the disqualified
That can help me know if it is accurate or inaccurate 

- (card review page)

- Yes, if I’m not mistaken, the previous page 
- It says the Veteran is not eligible for Tricare, on the previous page I am saying I am eligible or enrolled, but it is telling me I am not eligible for Tricare. I would still reach out to CHAMPVA and maybe reach out to TRICARE to see if there is something between the two about using the benefits

- I would hard stop and not waste my time. I would exit the application and may not be elifigie.
- I would reach out to one of the two sources directly instead of applying 

- I would say 3 just because I am more fixed right now that the previous page selected I had TRICARE and not it is telling me I am not eligible for TRICARE
- The confusion now lies on the Tricare piece

- The red X on the gray box is contradicting what they selected on the previous page

- Would prefer the first one 
- Well it led me to believe I could continue the application and provide more details on eligibly 
- It doesn’t allow you other than your basic information 
There was nothing else I could input to check on eligible 

- I still think these, know it is a prototype , I think it is too much information 
- Just more streamlined, less is more in some of these applications in my opinion 
- It just seems like a lot (eligibility summary page)
- eligible or not eligible . If not reach this number, if you are continue 
- The flow should be a little bit easier in my opinion 

- Yeah, I think I could explain it, I would caveat it that it could come across as confusing and this particular program doesn’t allow you to provide information to verify your eligibility 


#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 

Alert A 
- I would just, it is basically saying what I inputted they can’t verify my elfigilbiy and I should go back and check my info - any of the information I was required to enter, If I misspelled something or but in the wrong number, so it couldn’t verify me so that is why I am not eligible
- No I would resort to my original route and I would still reach out to them directly 
(Would not continue application)

Alert B 
- At that very moment, they can’t confirm eliginb
I hate when I see these messages, it just says try again later.
I set aside time to do things like this, if I have to stop and come back it deters me from having to apply 
- Try to continue the application and see if it made any difference
- No (actions to take before doing so)

Alert C
- I take it the same as the first one, Alert A
- Just verify the information I put in, it can’t verify me because of the information entered I would go back
- Me personally I would just reach out to CHAMPVA or TRICARE, which one caused me the inability to apply 
- Yes, only because I verified, it is saying the information I entered is correct, I would feel more confident and not move on

Alert D
- Well if I was trying to determine what benefit I want to use, I would probably resort to TRICARE. Based on the information in DEERS I am not eligible to apply for CHAMPVA.
- I think it explains what the system found and what options you have

Alert E
- I wouldn’t want to see anymore information, if I was eligible for CHAMPVA this would be a good sign and I would apply 

- I would say 4 - even the ones that are a result of ineligible, it is not overly confusing. Verify information is correct or what the DEERS information reflects if you are eligible for Tricare. 
I feel confident on what to do 

- (unclear alerts) 
- No I wouldn’t say confusing . Personally the ones that say check back later are frustrating, but I wouldn’t say confusing 



#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- ok 
- The top are in reference to being eligible and not eligible and card style B is eligible and not eligible as it applies to CHAMPVA 

- Reference to CHAMPVA and TRICARE called out
- Seeing this one (B) would back what program I was actually applying for
- Because it reference CHAMPVA it is more informative on whether you are eligible or not eligible 

- Card style B (understand at a glance)

- They both look identical, it just have a reference to CHAMPVA. But it reference CHAMPVA, again be able to acknowledge what program I am applying for and if I am eligible 

I wouldn’t say unclear or confusing, they would know if they are at the login page and doing the eligibility check for CHAMPVA, but seeing it verifies what I am applying for. 




#### Post-Task Interview
- Nothing that stands out
- I think all the work that goes into continuous improve the processes 
- It has come a long way since I first looked into the system 
- Nothing that stands out

- (Confirm sharing) yes, I am fine with that
