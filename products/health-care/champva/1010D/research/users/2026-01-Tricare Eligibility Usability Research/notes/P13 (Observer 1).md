#### Introduction
- Yes (record screen and audio)
- Yes, of course (use clips)

[STARTS RECORDING]

- Yes (recording)
- Yes (use clip)


#### Warm-up Questions
- Yes (heard of CHAMPVA)
- Sure, I am not 100% on the eligibility from my understanding eligible Veterans, their families, whose families aren’t able to have healthcare under any other circumstances. I think the Veteran has to be 100%, not sure.
- Heard of TRICARE
- TRICARE is for active duty and service members and their dependents, or those who are retired and their dependents. DOn’t have to be disabled in any form. 
- For those who are not 100% so families can have medical care.

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Okay… (scrolls through page and quietly reads)
- So this application is for those who would like to apply for CHAMPVA, and it will allow them to first check eligibility. And it annotations if they have tricare they are not eligible for CHAMPVA, it will let you check eligibility first then go forward. And if you need OHI and supporting documents. 
- Spouses or dependents and survivors
- Don’t see a reason why they wouldn’t be eligible
- I would click this link - Find out if you are eligible for CHAMPVA benefits
- So that did confuse me (sentence on eligibility check) .. Kind of like a pre-approval as you are going through the form and answer some questions and it lets you know if you are eligible or not.
- Maybe , I wouldn’t apply, maybe for reservists, maybe but they wouldn’t be rated so no.
- I guess it depends on the amount of research done previously, a lot of information out there not accurate, … clicks to static page
- I would want to do the eligibility ahead of time - doesn’t want to waste time and wants to know what needed to go forward

- [rating] I actually like how it was put together I would say a 5
- A lot of application any website and the VA - so much information on one page and get confused and a brain fog of I don’t know what to do next
- I think that is put together well and in the order in how you would want to do it for most people..



#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- What I mentioned before, I like that it is letting you check for eligibility but that is the gray area, check ahead of time. Not expecting this format. 
- It’s not going to let you go forward if not eligible (assuming)
- Ok, I think that’s pretty clear (your information page)

- [warning alert]
- Ok, so that kind of touches on that TRICARE piece of it, as long as you are eligible you are not eligible for CHAMPVA, even if not enrolled in CHAMPVA
- Clears it up
- I do probably have a little bit more knowledge of the system overall, DEERS, /.. I issued ID cards when in navy on civilian side and help do research and guide them
- Participant comments they are in the weeds on this ID card side of it on the military and civilian side, but notes does others need to do research themselves.

- I like it (*how eligibility is checked here)
- No, it was helpful for me
- Yes, um.. because I know that the systems work together, but there could always be one offs of what they are eligible for or under, there could be those one-offs where they want to fight it a little bit, maybe because the don’t understand.
- It gives me the option to continue so I would continue to see what would happen next
- NO but I have a question.. never mind..reading that too fast.
- No, pretty simple on this page
- (not eligible belief) I think that I would, from my standpoint, I would go to a DEERS location and address it there to find out. But I think a lot of times people are going to try and call the VA first
- Yes, I would I would want to know what it will allow me to do next, it may allow me to go and check something elsewhere 
- Will address eligibility concern at end
- I think that it explains very well why I am not eligible, so I think that it’s helpful 

- Like I mentioned before, I do see where it will let you go to, or check the TRICARE eligibility. That is convenient as well.

- So where it has the X for my response, the Veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRicare … hold on a sec ( re scrolls and reads though page) Is there a way to go back??

- So I marked yes, that someone was eligible or enrolled and here it has an X that a Veteran is not eligible. I am confused about that.

- I am answering for everybody from the beginning.. we did mark some
- The system and question response isn’t aligning to eligibility summary pattern box
- It is contradictory, whether yes it is showing and I marked yes, but then it has the X saying we are not eligible for TRICARE, so I would be caught up right here.
- From what I understand at the beginning, no you can not. If you are eligible for TRICARE, you can’t be eligible for CHAMP

- This is my responses so what I wrote - oh… wait a minute, no. The green check marks is that one of those is true, one of those 3. The red X means I marked the Veteran is not eligible or enrolled in TRICARE>
- It is saying I may not be eligible, still not giving me a clear picture if I am eligible or my dependents 
- I am not confident now - at the beginning it says if you are eligible for

- I probably would have went back and check in DEERS to see what DEERS actually says and who is under TRICARE
- I would have went back and check the TRICARE, depending on what is there I would continue (since they have that option)

- [rating] This screen is more like a 3 probably, let’s go with a 2
- due to messaging and content, Yes, the green check mark and the red x and it specifics that is my responses so it really confused me.



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE



#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Are you able to tell me if that last sentence was on the last one? (Eligibility intro page)
- I just didn’t recall reading it - sometimes I am bad about proactive reading and getting the information I need and just going forward, may have missed that last sentence. 
- I guess it makes you think about it , for empathetic people, do I really need to be in this line if I’m not eligible. Some people it won’t matter to them and they will go forward.
- Same information, clear, going forward

- Oh… this is where it was before… 
- I don’t think anybody is eligible for TRICARE, so I would just go forward
- So that checks, this time both with green check marks. As of here, I would be good to continue, there aren’t any questions on whether or not I am eligible or not.
- See two green checkmarks and they both align with what I marked
- Marked 100% and not eligible for TRICARE, also there wasn’t that flag in there that warning that I am eligible for TRICARE
- Between not seeing the alert and seeing the two green check marks feels more confident to proceed.

- This one is a 5 for easily understanding it.
- this one (prefer to use Blueberry)
- Before, the system flagged me, the other one had flagged that I was in or eligible for TRICARE or somebody was. 
- Is this supposed to be the exact same person, same information across the board

- The other person, application, did get that flag because DEERS is showing in the system (notes different eligibility scenarios)
- I think this one is easier because it is an easier situation, more simpler to begin with 

- (goes back in prototype to review)
- So I remember on the first screen now, or the next one… you need to check your eligibility now or it will check it through you in the application. I noticed that was missing, but I guess I wasn’t questionable on my eligibility too I guess. 
- This one doesn’t have it where you can check it ahead of time (notices missing alert)
- It seemed like it might have caused confusion, but it might be depend on the situation. If the two prototypes were done in the same scenario, would be easier to tell which one is easier.
- That gives you the warm and fuzzy to check it now before I go forward. 

- I think for this situation, this prototype is good and provided a good amount of information
- Yes (confident in explaining to a friend)


#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- That would give me anxiety. If I know I am a registered Veteran with the VA, I would be freaking out. Scrambling to get on the phone with the VA to know why I am not showing in the system. 
- That would be off my radar at first, and would want to know that is going on with my VA eligible first (would think of TRICARE connection)

Alert B
- So that, I would be confused with this. I wouldn’t know what eligibility it is taking about - my TRICARE eligibility, or my VA eligibility? If it was my VA eligibility I would be on the phone trying to figure out what is going on

Alert C
- I do like the fact that it adds in there, check the information. The reminder that I may have fat fingered it. But I am still not going forward if I think it is my VA benefits in question
- Would want to reach out to somebody at the VA

Alert D
- So this one is similar one to the Pineapple prototype. Where it clarifies that I am not eligible for CHAMPVA because I am eligible for TRICARE benefits. And as before would like to go forward to find out what’s next
- If it myself or anyone else. Not knowing all the rules of CHAMPVA, might still be eligible.
- Talks about dependent and ages and entire family eligibility 

Alet E
- Yeah, I would just continue 



- There was only 2 I was confident, and I know what was going on
- The other two something else
- The last one confident

- Across the board a 3

- yes (confusing) the one’s that didn’t mention what I was not eligible for. It said it or I assumed that it was the VA benefits, in the VA system it was having a hard time finding me. The other 2 or 3 it was not clear if it was the VA, CHAMP, Tricare. Was not clear.
- The unclear ones did not specify 


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- The only thing that was still confusing me was your responses going back to the prototype.
- Reads through card style A a couple times

- So, A, is saying that I may be eligible .. so that makes me possibly eligible
- This one is saying, I may not be eligible based on my responses… I still don’t like this, how it has the not eligible. How it has the red x there.. 
The double negative is throwing them off.

— I do remember thinking when I was reading them the third is my favorite. The last two cleared up more I think.

- I like it where it says your responses didn’t meet CHAMPVA requirements, that kind of makes it make more sense with the red X there. It is not one going against the other.
- The additional sentence clarifies eligibility for them
- The last one is easier to understand at a glance

- So one is that little Your responses met or didn’t meet I like that added that in there (heading)
- The double negative with the X and the not, that I think it works better here. The Veteran is eligible that is a requirement and the X shows that requirement hasn’t been met. 






#### Post-Task Interview
- Nope, I think we were able to clear every thing up
- I do like, because some people are going to want to be able to check it a head of time. Let me go ahead and see before I move forward. I prefer that.
- I like the pre-check system then I can decide if I want to waste my time further. 




#### Additional Notes**
- Participant was confused by the eligibility review box and interpreted the red X and TRICARE eligibility as being the opposite of what they entered. At the end they noted they preferred the alternative card summary B as it clarify the confusion.
- They called out that the prototypes were for different eligibility scenarios so it was difficult to pick a preference, but noted they would continue on in both scenarios to see what would happen next in the application 
- The participant found the alert options to be a mix of clear and confusing - most of the confusion was around wanting additional clarity of what system was being checked and what benefit eligibility was being referenced.
