#### Introduction
- iPAD

#### Warm-up Questions
- Never applied for CHAMPVA. Heard of champs before yes.
- Not sure what CHAMPVA is. Knows it is some type of insurance. Mentions TRICARE that her friends dad had when retired. Doesn't know the different between CHAMPVA and TRICARE.

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [X] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Info for CHAMPVA, tells who is eligible.
- I am the spouse of the Veteran, caregiver for my father that is 100% disabled.
- There is a backup that will double check my eligibility.
- Would like to know what types of benefits CHAMPVA has, What it covers and doesnt and how the program works. Bullet points.
- **Rating 5** - Bullet points would be helpful


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Check eligibility - Would read the paragraphs then click continue - very straight forward.
- Could apply for someone else or I am the spouse of a Veteran.
- I love that its... I am assuming they would go through the VA app and everything would be loaded for them.
- Would be nice if everything as prepopulated for them, that would be great!
- Thinks how it checks eligibility is great and its help, and accurate.
- You can only be eligible for one or the other. Tricare or CHAMPVA.
- Would research in the VA app and look for additional info on TRICARE - Would like a link to TRICARE to go straight to it.
- Prefers that eligibility comes up immediately to prevent completing a form that takes time and not being eligible.
- Likes the dropdown with definition of service connected disability is very helpful.
- Likes there is a link to check eligibility on TRICARE website in dropdown.
- Checkmark is based on previous responses, I must fall into one of the listed categories. Yes, believes they are eligible for CHAMPVA, but not Tricare - confident in they are eligible CHAMPVA.
- Likes the ability to save the application and resume at a later point.
- **Rating 5** - plain and simple.


#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [X] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Notes

#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 

- Eligibility content - very straight forward.
- Very straight forward options for who is applying.
- Likes the asterisk in red and must be completed and required - which is good.
- Dropdown the second sentence - Assumes there are some Veterans that may be 100% but may improve, so they wouldn't be eligible.
- Everything is marked with Green check, so I would continue.
- **Rating 5** - Compared to the other prototype, this didn't have red x's and is clearcut that I am eligible to proceed.
- Would prefer the Blueberry - This one is not confusing. There is one section where the Veteran is eligible and the red x that they are not eligible. 
- The right info was available on the prototypes.
- Using Blueberry they would feel confident explaining to a friend.



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- **Alert A** - Would look for a something to go backwards to review the information to ensure it was completed properly.
- Would apply for CHAMPVA still with this warning. Would go back, review the info, correct the errors and look for any warning alerts.
- **Alert B** - Perhaps a link to go to the beginning of the info to look for errors. Once corrected, the program should allow me to proceed.
- The message is kind of confusing. I don't like alert B, who wants to go back into an app that is confusing. They can't confirm eligibility or try again later.. Is the app down. I would be frustrated if I went back later and still get the same scenario.
- **Alert - B** - Post rating statement. didn't care for. why select continue if giving you and icon warning. Don't care for you can try again later. is the app or system down. Don't want to waste my time.
- **Alert C** - Would prefer there was a link to go backwards to review the info. There is no sense in clicking continue, waste of time because of the error. Wants to resolve the issue.
- **Alert D** - It's either one or the other. You can't have Tricare and CHAMPVA.
- A little link for TRICARE, "Click here, this link will take you to TRICARE benefits". Wants a redirect.
- **Alert E** - This has a green checkmark which is proceed.
- The others have a triangle
- **Rating 5** - Very confident - tells if you a eligible and which program.
- I Like Alert A - with a drop down or link to go back to check info and accuracy.


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- **Card style A** - Left information I do like that.
- Box on the right, infers you cant be in both programs, one or the other.
- **Card style B** - Left box - tells they meet the prerequisites. pretty straight forward.
- Right box - These responses are perquisites for CHAMPVA. X red tells me to stop, Top portion meets CHAMP VA and isn't eligible for Tricare.
- User doesn't see the different immediately.
- Card style B - is easier to understand.
- Card B - reminds you this is for CHAMPVA - you either met or didn't meet the Eligibility, and the Veteran is eligible for TRICARE.
- 



#### Post-Task Interview
- If the user was alerted with an email if the dependent, spouse, or Veteran, you may be eligible for CHAMPVA or TRICARE . They would click on links and be taken to the area to apply.

#### Key Take-aways
1. Loves the idea of everything being prepopulated in the form.
2. Prefers the Blueberry prototype as it is not confusing.
3. Like the ability to save a form and return later to complete the process.
4. Strong opposition to Alert B - Why select continue if giving you and icon warning. Don't care for "you can try again later". Questions if the app or system down and doesn't want to waste their time.
5. Preferred Card Style B - as it was easier to understand and reminds you this is for CHAMPVA - you either met or didn't meet the Eligibility, and the Veteran is eligible for TRICARE.
