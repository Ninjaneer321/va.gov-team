#### Introduction
- Partner served in Air Force, TRICARE was their healthcare while parner was in serving, now they still use it and pay for it

#### Warm-up Questions
- Notes

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Looks like an intro to CHAMPVA, an application for medical care, essentially
- The page asks if you've heard/know of CHAMPVA, which I've never
- Eligibility... pretty step by step, I like that
  - Not all members are eligible, 
  - Clicks eligibility link, opens new tab
  -   a LOT of information
  -   I would have to see if I were eligible...
  -   In the prior screen it said "certain criteria" but now I don't see...... *scrolls* oh found it.
  -   Now it says here that: You're the spouse... permanently... Your spouse has to be 100% disabled or passed away.
Back to prototype
- I assume they're going to ask for my social security number to confirm our eligibility. I know I'm in the system
- It's helpful to know they'll check our eligibility so I think they'll do that.
- I personally don't know the whole process or how they know we're eligible
- I know my partner needs to log into "Homestead" to get paper proof that they are 100% disabled
- This page could be hard for someone who's deaf
- "It might say yes you are eligible or not and I hope it just says yes."
- Easy, scores it an 8/10, changes to 5/5 ;)
  - I personally hate visiting this website because theres so many pages, articles, etc
  - But I like this page because it's all laid out step by step


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Page 1
  - "Not sure what that last sentence is about" they kinda take it personally!
- Page 2
  - Makes sense!
- Page 3
  - If someone's in a rush people can miss that they they're filling out info for the veteran, not themselves as a spouse.
 - Theres a lot of information in this alert. So you can be eligible for TRICARE and not CHAMPVA, okay. Hard to parse.
 - It did what I thought it was: checked my social security number, CHAMPVA verified what I am and am not eligible for. "May not be eligible?" well am I or am I not?
   - In this placement, this alert is confusing to me. Maybe it should have been before I started the form/filling out info.
   - This could be very confusing especially to an old person! They get to this point and the wording has them wondering "should I go on? Should I not?"
   - "I would hit continue just to see what happens next!"
   - Maybe this alert could be at the end of the application because it may make someone hesitant to continue...
   - It says "may not" so I'm just gonna hit continue.
   - I know partner is 100% disabled so I would probably stop and call to make sure everything is fine...
   - Gonna question DEERS regarding eligibility, make sure they know partner is 100% disable.
   - This alert is not stopping me from applying. I will continue. In the end, there's still a button that says continue, so I will try to continue.
- Page 4
- Page 5
  - Does not need additional information
  - At this point in your lifetime you know what you are
- Page 6
  - Yes
- Page 7
  - The green check means yes. If you can say yes to the green check, this is saying you can hit continue
  - BUT you can exit the application if the vet isn't eligible for TRICARE.
  - Initially misreads eligibility box
  - X means spouse is confirmed to not be eligible for TRICARE, so they can continue
  - THE CONTINUE BUTTON IS STILL THERE SO I'M GONNA HIT CONTINUE
  - OR this page means I need ALL green checks and since there's a red X, I need to exit out.
  - Two routes of interpreting this page!
  - I'M GONNA CONTINUE! Cuz why not ;)
  - Ease of use score: 1/5
    - Confusing!
- Back to prototype start page

#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Page 1
  - The VA just doesn't want me to bombard the system with false applications, okay
- Page 2
  - I'm a spouse this is correct
- Page 3
  - Pretty standard
- Page 4
  - He has not died, we'll continue
- Page 5
  - Yes
- Page 6
  - No, okay.
  - "It says any"
- Page 7 
  - Oh god dang.
  - Now I get green checks.
  - Now I know that if you don't have TRICARE then I'm gonna get a green check.
  - So I'm assuming that I read the prev prototype wrong, you can't have both.
  - Nothing is making me second guess anything, so we're all green good to go!
  - This one I'm confident, no red X's, we're conditioned that Red = bad!
  - Ease of use score: 3/5 (rating both versions of pages)
    - Only because now I see that you can't have TRICARE with this. User error was made.
    - For me they're both the same, maybe in the eligibility reqs in the beginning, it says you had to be a service member/spouse/dependent who's 100% disabled or passed away, but I don't remember anything that mentioned TRICARE, could be an oversight on my part but that should be plain and clear. You can't double dip with TRICARE and CHAMPVA.
  - Preference between prototypes: between the two prototypes it was the same, it was just an a-ha moment with the TRICARE question. I got two different results only because of lack of understanding of TRICARE.
  - Would not feed confident in explaining this process to a friend.
    - READ ELIGIBILTY, THATS SO IMPORTANT!

#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Alert A
  - I'd continue because it could have been user error, I could have entered the wrong number.
 
- Alert B
  - I'd try again later! I wouldn't hit continue if they couldn't confirm his eligibility.
 
- Alert C
  - I'd just go back and make sure the info I entered was correct
  - We're human, fat fingers, we make errors.

- Alert D
  - This is worded so confusing to me, had to break it down twice!
  - OKAY Partner is in DEERS so that's GOOD
  - Even IF you AREN'T enrolled... does not AUTOMATICALLY? Make us eligible for CHAMPVA...? SO if you're eligible for TRICARE... you are NOT eligible for TRICARE. I'd have to go back, pause, and deep dive for more information regarding the two, just to confirm just cuz he DOES get TRICARE he cannot get CHAMPVA...
- Confidence rating: 3/5
  - I understand the alerts but I'm still gonna go to the websites to make sure and confirm what I interpreted

- Alert E
  - I'd continue! Green means go!

#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 

- Even on second viewing, Card Style A is re-confusing participant all over again
- The Xs and Checks... I don't even know what they mean anymore!
- First Card: GREAT!
- Second Card: Based on info, the applicant may NOT be eligible?? Why am I getting Xs here? It's confusing because we're conditioned on green/red colors. Second card means something is WRONG.

- Card Style B
  - See's difference between these and Style A.
  - Seems like extra sentence helps, but participant is confused, structure of prototype is confusing, isn't sure of what isn't being asked of them. Kinda just giving up, which is fair. Lots of content.
  - "I feel like I'm in an escape room and I'm not figuring out the way out here."
  - Conditioned on colors. Red means not to proceed with the application
  - Preference between card styles? "I like the second set because of new two lines" which make the situation plain and simple.

#### Post-Task Interview
- "That was crazy."
- I think anything military-related should be easily accessible and 'right there.'
- Sometimes I've applied for things through the VA or anything military and you always really have to deep dive for clarity.
- You should have a solid understanding for what you're applying for
