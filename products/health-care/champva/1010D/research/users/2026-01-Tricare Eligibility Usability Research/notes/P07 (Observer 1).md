#### Introduction
- Sure not a problem (record screen and audio)
- Sure (clips)

[Starts Recording]

- Yes (recording)
- Yes (clips)

#### Warm-up Questions
- A long time ago, yes
- I know that you or your spouse 100% disabled to get it, I know that it’s not like typical health insurance
- Oh yeah I was on that when my husband was active, yes (Tricare)
- Tricare from my understanding was active duty military, their families, spouses dependents a
- And there is this whole group that gets to use CHAMPVA, have a whole opinion on that program
- Have to be 100% in order to be eligible for the program 

- It’s a surface - don’t know what that’s considered anymore (laptop or mobile question)


#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Okay… it is pretty basic. It looks to me the instructions on how to apply.
- If you already have benefits what to do, check your eligibility and go from there
- Spouses and dependents or survivors of a service member who meets service requirements. I guess I could click and find out what those are
- You can’t get CHAMPVA if you are eligible for TRICARE, that makes sense. 
- I would click on that link to find out if I am eligible
- To me it seems pretty staightforard
- Very easy to understand, very simple
- Get your stuff together and do your application, and upload the various proof and certificates and what not
- I would continue personally I would have reseearched all this before hand and be ready
- Trying to figure out what it was first before applying (arriving at this page)
- a 5 very confident
- The biggest thing is gathering all the little proof you need, finding all the certificates and where they are




#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- This all again is pretty standard to be honest, if I was doing this for real I would just click continue and keep on going and not read it
- I have read that before and it is being reiterated
- This is something I have seen in various forms (your info question)
- Again the Veterans information, nothing out of the ordinary, you should have that and it wouldn’t be a problem
- Veteran status should be able to answer that no problem
- That is something you should be able to answer and click on the little link to get more information
- I’m not eligible and that there is a link to check.
- I like that there is a I’m not sure because some people might not
- and I would click continue
- And yay, I’m eligible, that is clear
- There is a way to get out of the application if not, sorry

- It means that I am able to receive CHAMPVA benefits, I’m eligible. Because of my Veteran’s disability status and my Veteran or myself or not eligible for Tricare so we are eligible for CHAMVPA.
- And not we have to fill out the rest of the form to get cards I guess or whatever for this information.
- To me the green check marks mean you are good to go, you met the requirements
- If one showed up red there is a problem and you would have to fix or you are not eligible and would need to exit and figure something else out.

- I;’m eligible. Very confident, easy to see. Green means go, explains why.
- This is an assumption, but if you are not I would assume it would tell you why.
- For the average person dealing with computers, this is an easy thing to grasp.

- Very easy, 5. To me it was incredibly easy. Simple, easy to understand, clear. 
- In between the gray box and text is a big you are eligible, or not eligible. Big bold green or red. To make it even more simple to understand. 



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE



#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- This is the same as the other one, checking your eligibility so you can determine if you should apply for this if it’s worth your time.
- That is pretty easy to understand
- Veterans information , simple nothing out of the ordinary
- Clearly labels it is for the Veteran and not for you, if you are used to the military that’s your sponsor that makes sense.
- Now it is telling you are not eligible because you are in DEERS
- I like it , it makes it easy for you
- It immediately tell you, you are not going to have to wait for weeks to wait for a letter in the mail
- I think it’s helpful, makes it easier for me to figure out what to do to move forward
- For my situation, no. But for this individual it would be applicable. For me personally we have not been in that system for 10 years, so I would be like they make a mistake.
- I would talk to my husband because there is a problem , not sure how to call, but that we would have to figure that out.
 
- If it is true, I would stop trying to get enrolled. Because we already have Tricare and we would not need CHAMPVA.
- If this applies to me I would stop the application, and maybe as a few questions of like a Tricare representative
- No point in moving forward if not eligible 
- Some kind of a link to take you where you could talk to someone, or get a phone number. I hate the chat bots - but where you can get ahold of a person and find out what this means. 

- Would reach out to husband first then together a representative or another human being to figure out what happened.

- I think it’s helping - it is very clear you may not be eligible and you may not want to move forward until you figure out what is going on .

- Yes or no, can’t do much more with that
- Again, you are you aren’t and if you don’t I don’t know what to tell you. You should know.

- I like it you get the red X. I thought you would.

- This is what I thought would happen, I am kind of excited. 
- Well again, I think there should be between the title and box - make it red may not be eligible. 
- I would try to find out because you are not eligible for Tricare you should be eligible for this. 
From what I understand if you don’t get Tricare you should be good to go - there is a disconnect there.
- That is a bit of conflicting information (reading Tricare sentence with red X)
- Again a 5 - something of a bold statement telling you eligible or not eligible.

- Not really (preference) It wasn’t such a glaring difference, I couldn’ tell you what it was

- I think it is the right amount of information , enough to get more information, move forward or stop the process all together.

- Yes, I could easily walk someone through this. 


#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 

Alert A
- Okay that would be scary, not that it’s a bad alert. But if you can’t find in the system them causes a bit of panic. Need some kink of a link to a person to figure out what is going on.
- If I got that, go back and make sure typed in correctly, and got this again. I would look for someone to speak to, some kind of representative to find out what is happening.
- I would still try to apply, but get this cleared up before moving forward.
- Talk to somebody so I could move forward

Alert B
- I would probably hit continue so I could see what happens next, what I could complete. Then find a representative to speak to. 


Alert C
- I would do the same thing, hit continue, complete application and try to find somebody.
- The biggest thing is to reach out to a human being to figure out what is going on
- If there systems are down, if you get a message that we can’t confirm you because system are down and try again later that would be helpful. And if they had a timeframe that would be extremely helpful, then the person is not worried. Its to me, its you.

Alert D
- Much like before, I would see that and I would stop the application. It clearly says for whatever reason you are not eligible because you are found in the system.
- I would want to reach out to a representative, we are no longer in DEERS and should not be in the system and get that straightened out. Or if the person is eligible and finds out then they shouldn’t apply. 


Alert E
- Nothing , just keep on going. Don’t need to speak to anybody, just keep on going. 


- Definutly a 5 incredibly confident on how I would proceed in the scenarios.
- The only thing, very simple, an orange stripe at the end. Instead of orange, make it red. People see red they know there is a problem. 

- Associated colors with driving 

#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- hmm. Okay, now I understand (reading through option B)
- Okay, ahah moment 
- ON card style A, the red X makes me think something is wrong. But wait a minute, I’m not eligible. 
- Okay let me see how I can explain this, it needs to be really bold

- My brain is like wait a minute that doesn’t make sense to me.
- The sentence with not eligible for Tricare and the double negative was confusing for the participant.

- All four are telling you if you should proceed with your application
- Or if you should stop your application and figure out what happened and where the problem is so you can move forward or just stop all together.

- Card B - with the little red X makes sense to me — Yes! That’s not messing with my brain.

- That makes a lot more sense to me, B

- (looking for difference) I admit I might not be able to see it, what’s the difference?
- Oh I see that, your responses I like that
- Now I see it, in B I like this statement but it needs to be bolder so that they can see it. Or a different color, or bold and a different color. 

- B (easy to understand at a glance)
- It makes sense, when you look at the card on the right that has the red X and the wording is correct. That is what tripped me up on the other (A)
- It’s very very clear to understand you are a go or you are a no

- Not anything I haven’t already said


#### Post-Task Interview
- Not that I can think of, I’m really happy they are moving to an online system
- When I applied forever ago it was paper had to fill it out and wait for ever and a day
- I like that you could stop your application and come back to it at a later point and you are good to go
- You get immediate feedback, not waiting weeks.

- No never did it again (not enrolled) 

- PROGRAM elaboration …

Don’t have a clear understanding of what covered, how it works

Doctors don’t have clear understanding on how to bill this program
