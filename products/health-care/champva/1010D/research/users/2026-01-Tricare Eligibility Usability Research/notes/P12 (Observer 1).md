#### Introduction
- Okay to record
- okay to share
- He's off camera

#### Warm-up Questions
- has not applied before
- has heard of the program
- in  his own words: for vets familiy members who need healthcare, but not eligible for tricare
- has heard of tricare
- difference between tri/cva: cva is a hmo - pay for out of pocket, tricare you pay for but you have option between military and civilian as needed (i think he meant civilian/va care?)
- on a tablet

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- basically asking if you've applied for cva/how would you apply
- breaks it down easy, opens new tab for eligibility
- goes through what you need
- then you would go through the application and they'll get back to you after
- blue box should be at the top prompting you to sign in
- who is eligible: yourself and you'd click on the link to see if your family members are eligible
- any reason you wouldnt be?: no
- "we'll also help you..." - expectation is that they'd take me to a page that would list who is eligible and what are the qualifications
- nothing that makes him uncertain about applying
- would probably look/take more information first
- he likely wouldnt have all the needed docs right away, would have to gather
- informed score: 4/5 - has most the information
- what would make it a 5 - bolded info with required info is at the bottomo.  would like bolded bullets for qualification/eligibily
- 


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- pretty self-explanatory, no d214, must meet requirements
- applying for everyone (your information page), doing his whole family
- enter his name on next page, self-explanataory
- verifying at the end, now it's saying he's not eligible
- how he feels - if it's looking for deers, it makes sense
- it's stopping him from wasting his time
- feels like it's helpful - good to know
- trusts that it's accurate
- would stop after seeing the message
- if he thought it was wrong, that he wasn't eligible for tricare, he'd look for contact information (email, chat or call center)
- seek contact before continuing
- feels like it's helping
- eligibility pattern - confusing because if he is disabled, he should be eligible.  if he's not eligible for tricare, he should be eligible for cva
- if youre eligble for tricare, you are not eligible for cva (what he believes)
- check = elibigble for tricare
- not eligible for tricare AND not eligble for cva
- 95% in that understanding
- wouldn't continue, would see what's going on (call)
- 5/5 - understands what it's saying but not the eligibility determination if he's fully disabled
- 



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Notes


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- pretty easy "who this is" or what bucket he fits in
- info all straight forward
- service-connected siability seems straight forward, understands there not being an "i dont know"
- tricare eligibility - there should 4 - yes (eligible, not enrolled), enrolled, i dont know, no
- double negative is throwing him off
- this time, he'd still have questions
- he thinks he would be eligible in this case, he'd continue
- easier to understand
- 5/5
- would prefer the second one
- 



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- a - can't find the info in the system, would go back to check that his info was entered correctly
- b - would try again later, figured it's a lag
- for a - wouldnt continue without confirming/correcting info
- c - would still contineu but he'd call at the end to confirm
- d - telling him he's not eligible because he's eligible for tricare
- would like to see a link on d taking him to tricare if he's eligible
- e - he would continue, everything looks good
- 5/5 - he thinks he's good
- no alerts that are confusing


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- A - left quad - telling him he's not eligible for tricare, that's why he's doing cva
- a - right - telling him he has a disability and that he IS eligible for tricare, but the double negative is tripping him up
- b - left - two checks b/c he's not eligible for tricare and fully disabled
- b - right - x is confusing because he is eligible for tricare, but he x implies not
- lower right quad tells him he didnt meet all requirements
- easiest at a glance - double check mark
- a vs b - b is better - the little statement at top made it very clear whether he met the requirements or not
- x throws people off, double check would have been preferred



#### Post-Task Interview
- No other feedback
- if you're eligible for tricare, it would be nice to direct them to tricare coverage (they're trying to get coverage somewhere)
