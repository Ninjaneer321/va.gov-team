#### Introduction
- that’s fine (recording)
- that’s fine (clips)

[ STARTS RECORDING]

- Yes I am comfortable
- Yes I am comfortable 


#### Warm-up Questions
- No (applied)
- Yes (heard of it)
- CHAMPVA eligibility - for family members of Veterans, if they are not eligible for TRICARE

- Yeah (have heard of TRICARE)
- Oh.. essentially CHAMPVA from what I understand is like an HMO, pay for it out of pocket. TRICARE you pay for it, but you have the option between military, CHAMPVA all civilian. Tricare is a mix, VA and civilian as needed. 



#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- So basically it says that it asking you if you have applied for CHAMPVA.
- Basically the landing page to apply for CHAMPVA, breaks it down pretty easy.
- I f you are eligible and what you will need, and then go through the application 

- This blue box, should start at the top because you have to sign in first anyways 

- Well who’s elibigibl to apply is yourself, but then you have to click on this for your family members.
- It says who - I don’t know who I am applying for

- For me, no. But um… spouse dependent or survivor it does say it up top. I don’t know why I wouldn’t be eligible, would need to click on the hyperlink to find out if I am eligible.

- That I am , that they check your eligibility, expect it to take me to a page of who is eligible and a list of qualifications

- Nope (nothing making unsure about applying)
- I would probably want more information first, probably because I wouldn’t have everything needed to apply. I would need to all these things, that’s why I wouldn’t end up applying today because I would need to gather this stuff.

- [rating] um feel that I am able to get another information, 4
- (make it a 5) not having to .. you should have some bullets for qualifying, like the bullets for what you need. But not a list of qualifying in bullets. 



#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- All right that is pretty self explanatory, don’t need my DD214, and must meet all the eligibility requirements 

- Here I am applying for everybody, my whole family and everyone that I think is qualified

- This is my name and contact information, so self explanatory

- Now it is going to verify, that I’m not applicable
- If it is looking for my DEERS number that makes sense, but…
- So, it is giving you an option, you found a DEERS number, so you are aren’t eligible for CHAMPVA. So it is stopping me from wasting my time pretty much.

- It’s helpful, good to know
- Yeah (accurate)
- I would stop 
- No (nothing else want to see)
- I would look for a contact information, whether that is form of email, chat or telephone number
- I’d seek contact right away
- No it feels like it is helping me

- yes, that’s an easy
- This is asking me if I know I am eligible but it gives me the option if for some reason I didn’t know

- So because I am permanently disable, may not be eligible

- It’s confusing, because if I am disabled I should be eligible for TRICARE, And If I’m not eligible for TRICARE then I should be eligible for CHAMPVA
- I don’t think you can , I think that is the whole thing. If you are eligible for Tricare, you use Tricare. And CHAMPVA is for those who are not, I may be wrong.
- The check mark means that I am eligible for TRICARE since I am permanently disabled. 
- It is telling me that I am not eligible for TRICARE and I am not eligible for CHAMPVA either

- [confident in understanding] 95
- [really applying today] I would exit the application and see what is going on, and call if I believed I was supposed to be getting it

- [rating] um 5
- Um because everything , I take that back. I understand what this screen is telling you, … I understand the words, I just don’t understand why not eligible for both 





#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- All right, same thing as before, pretty easy to determine who I am , what bucket I fit it
- Name still the same, everything obvious
- (at first doesn’t remember disabled question]
- Tricare, so here it should be… I think there should be four radio buttons: eligible, enrolled, I don’t know, and no. Yes should be separated into two - eligible or enrolled.

- So this is with the check box, okay I see the difference… that is weird. 
- The previous screen had the x, so that meant… it meant that I actually I was or wasn’t eligible for TRICARE, this check means I’m not eligible for TRICARE.
- Double negative in first prototype was throwing them off.

- I would still question if I am not, since I am still, it appears that I am not eligible for TRICARE.
- Noooo… because I am not eligible for TRICARE, so based on my information I may be eligible, I am eligible because I am permanently totally disabled
- This is a positive, that I qualify for CHAMPVA
- I’d continue

- [rating] I think it was easier, I understand that if I am not eligible, makes me eligible for CHAMPVA. 5

- Prefer the second one, blueberry

- Right amount (of information)
- Yeah (explain to a friend)


#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 

Alert A
- So, … I would make sure everything is spelt right and numbers correct
- NO, I would go and check my information then continue 

Alert B
- Would try again later, thinking it is a lag

Alert C
- I would still continue, because and then at the end I would call. But I would want to get through it. 

Alert D
- Um.. I wouldn’t go on because it is telling me I am not eligible and that I am eligible for TRICARE
- Maybe a link, if I am eligible for Tricare maybe a link to enroll in Tricare

Alert E
- I’d continue, it says I ‘m good


- [confidence rating] 5 I think I’m good
- No (none unclear)



#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- So the first one, Card style A, left it’s telling me I am not eligible for TRICARE and I am permanently totally disabled and that is why we are doing CHAMPVA
- Upper right, it is telling me I have a disability and um… and that it is telling me that I am eligible for Tricare. The double negative I don’t know it just looks weird.

- I am eligible on B, lower left two check marks
- And I believe here it is confusing, because if I’m not eligible there shouldn’t bet be an X there, you telling me the reason why.
- There should be an x, that is why I am eligible for CHAMPVA because I am not eligible for TRICARE

- Met and didn’t meet requirements for CHAMPVA, 

- The double check marks (easier to understand at a glance)

- Um.. card B, just from the little statement on the top. So even if I am confused with this X here, I still know my responses didn’t meet eligibility . Then take a minute to think about it.
- This check mark means this is a requirement, 

- the use of the X throws people off, I think this is more clear, double green checks 




#### Post-Task Interview
- No, they were pretty cut and dry
- Um, just… like I mentioned before if you are not eligible, make the TRICARE a hyperlink and click on the word TRICARE to where they need to sign up. It seems to me if they are looking at CHAMPVA so they are trying to get healthcare from somewhere.

- Yeah that’s fine (clips)
