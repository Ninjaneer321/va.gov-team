#### Introduction
- Notes

#### Warm-up Questions
- Never applied to CHAMPVA and knows about it.
- Knows they are eligible for CHAMPVA if not eligible for Tricare.
- ! Claims CHAMPVA is like an HMO, and you pay for it out of pocket. 

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [X] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Brakes down the information easy. The blue box at bottom should be at top, because you have to sign in first.
- Don't see why they wouldn't be eligible immediately, I would have to go look to see if I'm eligible.
- User expects to be taken to a page to who is eligible.
- User prefers more information first before applying. Doesn't believe the would need to gather items before applying. Would return to apply.
- **Rating 4** - Needs bullets for who's eligible.


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Self explanatory, I know who I am applying for.
- Needs to verify, if its looking for their DEERS number it makes sense.
- Its stopping me from wasting my time. The info is helpful and feels its accurate. User would stop and not proceed.
- User would look for a contact info, email or chat if they didn't feel the info was accurate.
- Because I'm permanently disabled I may not be eligible. Confusing that he isn't eligible for TRICARE, then CHAMPVA is for those that are not eligible for Tricare.
- Checkmark means I am eligible for Tricare. System is saying I'm not eligible for either TRICARE or CHAMPVA.
- User is 95% confident on their understand of not being eligible. Would contact the VA. 5 Very easy to understand the screen. User understands the words but not why they arent eligible for either CHAMPVA or Tricare.


#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [X] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Notes


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Pretty easy to determine what bucket I fit in.
- Believes their should be four radio buttons - eligible or enrolled, no, I don't know.
- The previous screen with the X meant I was eligible for TRICARE, The check means I'm not eligible for TRICARE.
- Would still question eligibility. The user understands they are CHAMPVA eligible and would proceed.
- ** Rating 5** This experience is easier to understand.
- Would prefer blueberry, right amount of info.
- Could easily explain to a friend.



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- **Alert A** - Would go back check spelling and numbers. then continue with the application.
- **Alert B** - Would comeback and try again later.
- **Alert C** - Would continue and call at the end to confirm. Would want to get through it.
- **Alert D** - Would not continue because I would be eligible for TRICARE. Should have a link to TRICARE enrollment page because they are looking for insurance.
- **Alert E** - Would continue.
- **Rating 5** - Believes alerts were all clear.


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- **Card style A** - I'm not eligible for TRICARE and why we're doing CHAMPVA. Upper right - looks weird and is confusing.
- **Card style B** - I'm eligible because I'm not eligible for TRICARE.
- The Check and X's are confusing to the user and creates confusion because of double negative meaning.
- The double check mark is easiest to understand. Card B is easier to understand.
- The statement at the top of B adds clarity.
- The x icon throws people off. 



#### Post-Task Interview
- If you are not eligible, because you are eligible for TRICARE, adding a link to get to that type of insurance would be useful because they are looking for healthcare.

#### Key Take-aways
1. Double negative Iconography was confusing for the user in understanding whether they were eligible or not
2. If not eligible for CHAMPVA, they would like direct linkage to TRICARE to be able to apply.
3. User mentioned having ability to contact the VA if their information wasn't correct.
4. Blueberry prototype, although preferred, still provided ambiguity around eligibility, but user would proceed
5. Statement at the top of Summary card adds clarity.
