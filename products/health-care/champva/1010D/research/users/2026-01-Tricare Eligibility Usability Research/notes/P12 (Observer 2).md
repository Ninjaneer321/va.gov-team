#### Introduction

#### Warm-up Questions
- Never applied to CHAMPVA and knows about it.
- Knows they are eligible for CHAMPVA if not eligible for Tricare.
- ! Claims CHAMPVA is like an HMO, and you pay for it out of pocket. 

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [X] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Brakes down the information easy. The blue box at bottom should be at top, because you have to sign in first.
- Don't see why they wouldn't be eligible immediately, I would have to go look to see if I'm eligible.
- User expects to be taken to a page to who is eligible.
- User prefers more information first before applying. Doesn't believe the would need to gather items before applying. Would return to apply.
- **Rating 4** - Needs bullets for who's eligible.


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Self explanatory, I know who I am applying for.
- Needs to verify, if its looking for their DEERS number it makes sense.
- Its stopping me from wasting my time. The info is helpful and feels its accurate. User would stop and not proceed.
- User would look for a contact info, email or chat if they didn't feel the info was accurate.
- Because I'm permanently disabled I may not be eligible. Confusing that he isn't eligible for TRICARE, then CHAMPVA is for those that are not eligible for Tricare.
- Checkmark means I am eligible for Tricare. System is saying I'm not eligible for either TRICARE or CHAMPVA.
- User is 95% confident on their understand of not being eligible. Would contact the VA. 5 Very easy to understand the screen. User understands the words but not why they arent eligible for either CHAMPVA or Tricare.
