Participant: (Veteran / Family Member)

Notetaker: [Jessica]

-----

#### Introduction
- Yeah that’s fine (record screen and audio)
- yeah that’s fine (video clips)

[Starts Recording]
- Yes (recording)
- Yes (video clips)


#### Warm-up Questions
- No, never heard of it.. oh, I have heard of them this morning I read a clip on Facebook,
- Uh… so, that I read it its not the thing I thought it was. Civilian doing VA claims, but I guess it’s not the same
- Yeah I have heard of TRICARE
- Yeah, but it’s not the same as TRICARE? It’s different?
- Like one is, while I always thought TRICARE was just for military and Veterans actual members that served and their immediate family. And the VA was just for the service member. 


#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- It sounds like if the Veteran passes away, the dependents have insurance
- (Scrolling prototype issues)(shift to moderator to screen share)

- I can decipher, (a little blurry for the participant)

- Checking eligibility (application for) for a program
- The dependents, spouse and I guess immediate family 
- Uh.. (not eligible reason question) yeah if you have TRICARE. Basically you can’t have two insurances. 
- I would click find if you’re eligible

- If you complete the form, someone can help you but it’s kind of like contradicting, so find out if you’re eligible and then someone will help you complete the form. But if you can’t complete the form, you need help before. I think that line needs to go above it. 
- If you have TRICARe, will you lose your TRICARE if you apply for this??
- Or this program might have stuff that the TRICARE doesn’t have, but it isn’t giving me answers. If I apply for this will I lose TRICARE
- I want more information 
- How this benefit impacts TRICARE
- A fact before that section

- {rating} Not informed. I would give it a 2 I’m not going to fill this out before I know
- Wants a lot more information before filling out


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- (tries to make screen bigger on their end)
- (reads through first page) 

- So these are preselected … okay
- Nope (no questions so far)

- Uh, wait. It says how to check for TRICARE eligibility. So if you know if you have TRICARE or not. Are you or any applicants.. but at the bottom it says how to check, like it seems like they should know if they are in TRICARE or not. IT is hard not to know if you’re not

- Thought process is people would know if they are in TRICARE and wouldn’t need to check 
- So they mark no they are not, so I would check to make sure if I am eligible. 
- If you are telling me to check this if I am eligible for TRICARE, 9 times out of 10 it is probably telling you you are eligible. If they are asking you to check for it maybe you should be in TRICARE.

- It says your responses, that they went through the process. I think I missed something.. is there something above “Your responses”?
- had to scroll down… (reads page content out loud)
- I am not sure what that section, it says Your responses… (reads through page)
- Okay so based on my responses I got two green check marks so it is telling me I am eligible for the program
- So it has a green mark says a Veteran is not eligible for TRICARE, so… wait did I miss something? If you are eligible for TRICARE you are eligible for this too, did I miss something? Got a check mark the they are not eligible for TRICARE, so I hit continue.. 

- We are making sure we are eligible for TRICARE right now?
- But we click on check eligibility for TRICARE, right?
- Participant confused for a moment about which benefit eligibility check is happening 

- (green check) means that you are eligible

- Yes (thinks eligible for CHAMPVA) because I got two green checkmarks

- I’m confident
- I would, I met eligibility, so, I would select continue
- (rating) it was easy, two check marks. Give it a 4
- Just personally me, I’m not, I got the basis of it now



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE



#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- ok, continue… 

(Warning alert)
- (reads through alert) Oh, nice. Continue…
- It definitely screens it, like going into DEERS
- That red box is helpful, lets me know I am not eligible for the benefits quicker
- I mean.. (accurate trust)… yeah, you got my social security number and it is the government

- I would click continue just to see what is next. I want to see if it tells me, what gave it that notification. 

- (incorrect error) I would go back to the last page and reread it again and make sure I didn’t click the wrong thing
- I probably wouldn’t even, if it says I’m not eligible I’m not eligible. But I would talk to someone, reach out. 

- The system is telling me that I am not eligible, but I haven’t clicked continue yet to see if it is letting me go on. 
- But it does say if you are not eligible you are holding up progress for other people, but how do you know that is right. 

- Oh, wow, okay (TRICARE question page with add info open)
- No questions here 

- Oh, that’s the same, right? That is the same as before, it gives you the check marks and the X’s
- This one tells you didn’t meet it, the other checked DEERS, it did it for you very streamlined, Very quick. It’s okay, is it right, I don’t know. It is definitely better than the other one.
- You filled it out, filled out everything, you get two green check marks but actuality when someone reads your application and they found out you are not really eligible they could be checking someone who does qualify. 

- I would exit but I would definitely check twice , yeah I would contact at the bottom and make sure

- (rating) 5, I mean I understand it. Yeah, it’s easier yeah. 

- Pineapple preferred - it does all the , it does the work for you (liked system check)

- Too little (information) More clarification on before you even get to the putting in your social
- Yeah before starting the application (wants more info)
- Yes (confident in explaining to a friend)


#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
Alert A
- I have to check… would go back and check info
- (still see message) check it again, but still wrong but I would contact the system 


Alert B
- I don’t know. Alert B is… like if you didn’t find me when I put my info in, then I can complete the application in, how do I know my application is going to actually get to someone, if not in the system kind of thing?
- I would contact someone 

Alert C
- I would check information still and contact someone 


Alert D
- okay, I mean I would be contacting TRICARE about those benefits. 
- Or to get information on why I have TRICARE and don’t know I have TRICARE.


Alert E
- continue

- (rating) you mean on what to do - Overall? 3
- No, none were unclear, it’s just got to check everything 



#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- These are like summaries 
- Telling you if you’re eligible or not eligible and giving you the reasons why
- I’m looking at card style B… (reads through summary card content, goes back up to card style A and re-reads those too)
- Oh, never mind I see what you are saying - Card Style B. Now I know what I’m looking at, tells you if you’re eligible or not, met requirements. 
- (what makes clearer than A) Uh.. it doesn’t explain, like before it just says your responses
- Says card style B explains eligibility better 



#### Post-Task Interview
- Just more context to keep from hogging up the phone line, more of a question and answer section
- Information (more eligibility clarity) Like what’s it for - a lot more information 

- yes (sharing clips)


#### Additional Notes**
- Participant was confused initially on what the eligibility review screen was for - CHAMPVA or TRICARE eligibility 
- Participant assumed that the content on the TRICARE question page and the additional info component meant that most people (9 of 10) would qualify for TRICARE and that is why that information and link is there
- Participant preferred prototype Pineapple because it checked eligibility sooner and “did all the work for you” but they wanted a clearer action to take, would still continue in application to see what’s next
