#### Introduction
Prior recording: 
- Sure (recording screen and audio)
- I guess as long as it won’t leave that space that I am not aware of 

On recording: 
- Yes (screen and audio)
- Yes (clips)


#### Warm-up Questions
- I have not (applied CHAMPVA before)
- I feel like I have heard the name but I haven’t looked into it in detail, what it entails, characteristic of it
- I have heard of TRICARE, yes
- Um.. I would think probably the type of coverage what each of them, I think they are both a type of cautionary program in addition to your general health insurance
- What is covered and how that translates into cost for the user

- Desktop 



#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- To me this looks like your homepage if you will or landing page for the CHAMPVA benefits application. Information on what steps to look out for or are necessary
- First to see if you are even eligible for it…
- So definitely your starting point in the application process
- Spouses, dependents, survivors of Veterans or service members
- So if you are eligible for TRICARE you can’t , you wouldn’t be eligible for CHAMPVA
- Though what details go into that I’m not sure
- Right here - I see the hyperlink to find out if you are eligible
- I assume if you go there , 
- Again one disqualifying item is if you are eligible for Tricare you wouldn’t be
- Fairly concise way of giving you an overview of what the application might look like
- The documents you would need 
- I like that it tell you how much time it would take

- I would want information first regarding what exactly the benefits would look like. For somebody who does not know what CHAMPVA details. I don’t see anything that says what the CHAMPVA benefits are exactly. 
- Not really what are the benefit 


- I guess again if I had all the background of the CHAMPVA benefits, just the application itself — I would say a 5 related to the application process itself. 
- Not knowing where this page lives - this could be specific to the application process and there could be another page that talks more about the CHAMPVA benefits 
- If I had the background


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- This is eligibility information… (reads through page) 
- So far it is all kind of very basic info if you will

(Warning alert)
- Okay 
- I love it (how it checks eligibility)
- If I am not eligible I would rather know up front and not waste my time going through a broader application, 
- Not apply for something 
- Helpful, definitely not intrusive 
- I do trust that the information is accurate - there might be a case they find the Veteran’s information, don’t know where I was going with that … yes, I find it to be accurate. 

- If I knew that, I would still continue, I think you are still able to continue
- Of if I see that application is denied or can’t move forward I would look for contact information and reach out by phone
- It says it may not be eligible and I can see, not blocking me per say just a heads up

- This through me off it shows 1 of 7 (progress bar comment)
- I guess this is all part of the first step though, so maybe. I thought each page, but if section that could make sense. A little confusing

- Okay makes sense (disability rating additional info content)

- Opens TRICARE eligibilty add info 
- this is good right, you could double check that initial popup from earlier, if you think it is incorrect
- If think in system and not, that is a different conversation to be had

- I guess this is a little confusing, this box here.
- But the check mark and the x, I don’t fully understand from what point of view, being the check the response is good and the x is the response is not validating your eligibility.
- I am confused about 

- This is your eligibility summary, you may not be eligible and the responses I guess are flagged if you will
- What is throwing me off is the check and the x

- No (eligible for Tricare and get CHAMPVA)

- What’s throwing me off, how it is framed.
- It highlights these 2 responses, the responses that are sensitive to that .. to designating whether you are eligible for not.
- This x I don’t know if that is good or bad in this case.
- If that is your response, that would be a good thing
- This is the response that is validating your ineligibility.

- I’m not even sure, I think it is telling me I may not be eligible, Not exactly sure why… 
- The system telling me I didn’t meet, the tricare

- I don’t know, I’m 50/50

- I would continue the application and go from there, but still have some doubt if I can even apply for it or eligible for it

- This screen… a 2 or 3(these things throwing me off) Not that it is hard, but confusing how you view those lines or that
- A 2

 

#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Very familiar to the first, trying to see if I see anything that is different 
- It almost seems exactly the same, could be missing something


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Okay, same thing as before
- Same as before … 
- In this one we didn’t have that little box pop up letting you know you might not be eligible 

- Same thing (opening additional info component)

- Now I kind of see that the applicants may be eligible.. the pineapple prototype if you will, the latter assumption that we made, these are the two criterias.. but then responding along the way that the Veteran was eligible for Tricare which is why we had the x here. 
- This one is green lighted and that now eligible
- Context the same, now going through both and see the difference, seeing the angle going about it
- Same, just continue through

- It is essentially the same prototype a 5 in this case, if this would have been the first .. it is easier to understand both the options are green lighted.


- I guess what’s the difference. Both the same, just the results are different. In once case they might be eligible, they other they weren’t 

- I feel like the prototype itself is the same, or maybe I missed something 

- If that’s the case, yes I would rather use Pineapple (once pointed out earlier warning alert) 

- Just the right amount, I don’t want too much information being thrown at you but also not too little then you are also confused. 

- Yes, definitely (explain to friend)


#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- (reads through all alerts)
- Well I guess, which one .. there are different scenarios here
- I think A, B and C just can’t find
- And D is we found your info and not eligible 

- It confirm but you are eligible 

- I think it is telling me that it couldn’t find the Veterans information in the system overall, not just DEERS, but overall. That’s what I think A, B and C (not a Veteran in the system)
- If I know , yes I would still continue. Think system error and still continue with the application.

Alert D
- Not to this extent (additional info)
- Would like to see the hyperlink to the DEERS, in one of the flows have that to verify yourself in the system. 

- Confident ) 5 if I know what to do. A, B and C not sure if can’t find overall or just in DEERS itself. 

- More info in alerts A, B and C


- All 5 alerts, rating 4

- No (nothing else confusing or unclear) 


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Definitely like card style B much better
- This line right here clears up all the confusion (reads out headline)
- Yeah, B

- Your response didn’t meet this criteria… drawing a blank here.. a factor that is making you ineligible 
- (a checklist of sorts)

- No, not necessarily (that card B confusing) 



#### Post-Task Interview
- no, I think we covered it
- The added clarity in some of those, like the summary cards clears up some of the confusion noted throughout the flow
- The best way, as clear as possible. I like that it is broad upfront. The best way is hard to say because there are so many options.
- The way it is presented is good, just the wording, polishing that up. 
- If the applicant is eligible or not
