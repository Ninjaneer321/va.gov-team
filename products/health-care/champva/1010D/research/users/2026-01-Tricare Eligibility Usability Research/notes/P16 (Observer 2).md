Participant: (Veteran)

Notetaker: [Insert Name Here]

-----

#### Introduction
- Laptop

#### Warm-up Questions
- Never heard of CHAMPVA until this AM from a Facebook article. I thought it was AI taking over for civilians doing VA claims.
- Has heard TRICARE, and knows that CHAMPVA is different. TRICARE is for the Veterans and immediate family. VA is just for the service member, but that isn't correct.

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [X] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Sounds like this is if the Veteran passes away, the dependents have insurance.
- This application is for checking eligibility. The Dependents, spouse, immediate family is who this is for.
- You can't have two insurances. Would click find out if you're eligible.
- If you complete the form someone can help you. This is contradicting. But if you can't complete the form. Mentions information should be placed above.
- This program may have stuff that TRICARE doesn't.
- User want more information. Wants a FAQ for this section.
- **Rating 2** - I'm not informed. Wants more information before proceeding.


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Are these pre selected?
- Wait is says how to check for TRICARE eligibility - you know if you have TRICARE or not. Seems like they should know if they are on TRICARE or not. You know if you are paying for TRICARE or not.
- I don't understand why that is in there. If it is telling you to check for TRICARE, maybe you should check to see if you're eligible for it.
- I think I missed something. Is there something about your responses. So based on my responses I have two green checks that tells me I'm eligible for the program.
- I think I missed something. User is confused on the eligibility. We are making sure we are eligible TRICARE right? User believes they are checking for TRICARE.
- Green check means you are eligible. I have two green checkmarks. I'm confident now that I know I am not checking for TRICARE eligibility.
- **Rating 4** - That was easy. 



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [X] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Notes


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Oh nice! Views the message.
- Definitely streamlines the checking process by going into DEERS.
- The box is helpful in letting me know I'm not eligible quick.
- You got my SSN and it is the government. So trusts the information.
- If the user doesn't think the error message is right they would go back to the prior page to make sure the info is right.
- I would reach out and talk to someone directly. Contacts the VA.
- How do you know its right? I would still continue even though it says you may be holding up other people.
- oh Wow!
- Oh this is the same. I didn't read it but it gives the checkmark and x's.
- This one tells you, you didn't meet it. It checked for you and is very streamlined.
- This is definitely better than the other one.
- User would definitely check twice, but would exit.
- I would use the contact info at the bottom.
- **Rating 5** - it's easier.
- Would prefer to use Pineapple. It does the work for you and the system check.
- There was too little info. Needs more info before starting the application.
- Would feel confident explaining to a friend.



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- **Alert A** - User would go back and check info. If it is still wrong I would contact the system.
- **Alert B** - I don't know. If you didn't find me when I complete the application. How do I know my application is going to get to someone. I would contact someone.
- **Alert C** - Nope, Would check information and contact someone.
- **Alert D** - OK. I would be contacting TRICARE for benefits. To get information why I have TRICARE.
- **Alert E** - Would click continue.
- **Rating 3** I'm half and half.
- Everything was clear. Gotta check everything.


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- **Card Style A** - These are like summaries
- **Card Style B** - Ok
- Telling you if you're eligible and not and the reason why
- (Redirect) to paragraph on card B - Telling you if you're eligible and not and the reason why.
- Oh never mind. I see what you're saying. Card style B.
- It doesn't explain, on card style A, B does.



#### Post-Task Interview
- More context to keep from hoggin up the phone line. Needs a question and answer section.

#### Key Take-aways
1. Participant was not clear on what the CHAMPVA is, and overall desired additional information to better understand if they were eligible.
2. Participant was delighted with the Pineapple precheck of information with DEERS for eligibility and quickly informing them if they were eligible.
3. Participant missed the clarifier statement on Card Style B - but on redirect acknowledged that the statement was helpful in conveying eligibility.
4. Participant became confused using Blueberry prototype believing they were applying for TRICARE benefits, not CHAMPVA.
