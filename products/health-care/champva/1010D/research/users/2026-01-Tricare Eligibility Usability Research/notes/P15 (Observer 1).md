#### Introduction
- Sure (record screen and audio)
- Sure (use clip)


[STARTS RECORDING]

- Yes (recording)
- Yes (clips)

#### Warm-up Questions
- No (applied)
- I have heard of CHAMPVA before, yes
- Since I am not involved I don’t know what it is, know it is some sort of insurance. Had a friend when her dad was retired military but I believe she talked about it was called TRICARE, she was already an adult her mom and dad had it because her dad was retired.
- Couldn’t explain the difference between the two “No, I couldn’t”

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- It’s just info for CHAMPVA, the pre reqs and who’s eligible. The insurance of CHAMPVA, different links and so forth.
- That would be spouse, dependent or survivor that meet certain criteria, that’s it
- Myself, I am the spouse of a Veteran, but I’m doing this study as the caregiver for my father who is at 100% disabled. To check your eligibility under number 1
- That there is a back up that will double check my eligibility
- No (nothing uncertain about applying)
- I would like to know what types of benefits the CHAMPVA has, give a little more what it does and does not cover. How the program works 
- At least some bullet points
- (rating) 5
- (improving) nothing besides those bullet points, no



#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- I would just read the short paragraphs, and then I would click continue, it is very straightforward. 
- I would click on I’m the spouse, dependent or survivor or in my dad’s case, he is 100% disabled, I may click this on his behalf and click the bottom one, applying for benefits on behalf of somebody else.
- Asking basic information, Veteran’s name, DOB, social very straightforward
- I am assuming this prototype is somebody would have to go through the VA app and then everything would be loaded for them, is that what it should be.
- It would it be nice, if someone where to find this information and they are wanting to apply, that everything is already pre-populated. That would be great.

-(warning alert)
- I think it’s great, it saves time. It is telling the applicant they might not be eligible for the benefits and the reason why.
- Helpful and accurate
- It says this person is in already enrolled in TRICARE, then it already says if you are not enrolled if you are eligible. SO you can’t be eligible for both, one or the other.
- I would research in the VA app if that’s how I got here and look for information on TRICARE, since it says I am eligible for TRICARE
- A link to TRICARE so I can go straight into it 
- It would be helpful if perhaps there was another link that states eligible or ineligible then it takes you to which choice you chose
- I would stop application and get more information on the TRICARE

- Well it brought up the window that states I may not be eligible for CHAMP then talks about TRICARE, to me that is a timesaver instead of going through the entire application process. 
- I prefer that it comes up immediately after name, DOB and social

- I’m reading about the Veteran’s status, if they died they will ask more questions.

- And I would look at the drop down where it defines the service connected disability 

- And the prerequisite is 100% disabled and not expected disabled and permanently and totally disabled. I like that drop down with the definition of service connected disability. Very helpful.

- Just going over the eligibility for the TRICARE and um…it just states it is a health program for service members and their families, to be eligible you must be enrolled in TRICARE, and it is required so I would click yes. 
- And it just states .. uniformed service decides who is eligible and DEERS and a link I can click on to check my eligibility on the TRICARE website, I like that 

- Hmm.. ok. The CHAMPVA benefits summary has the box, it states based on the Veteran’s information the Veteran may not be eligible. My responses a check or an X, (reads bullets). And then the X is the Veteran or applicant is NOT eligible for TRICARE. So it is a summary of based on my responses, for the CHAMPVA eligibility .

- No (can’t get both understanding)
- The check is based on my previous responses, it is giving me I must fall into one of these categories. (Reads bullets)
- Um.. CHAMPVA, yes. But I would not be eligible for the TRICARE/ Because there is an X in that same box, says that applicant is NOT eligible for TRICARE.
- Confident
- Well the next thing I would read, is if I didn’t meet all the criteria, the next thing I would do is exit. But then it says if you did meet or still believe you are eligible, select continue button. 
- I also like that if you are under a time constraint, that you don’t have to start over from the beginning and it just starts from where you left off. 
- This is for the CHAMPVA, so I would continue because I met the criteria
- It was plain and simple, a 5



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- This is just stating the eligibility requirements for CHAMPVA and ask a few questions to ensure I am eligible. It says it will use the Veteran’s information to confirm for the Veteran and the applicants, won’t need to load the DD214. And must meet all the eligibility requirements, if not submit an application and it would delay for other applicants. Very straightforward.

- Asking for my personal situation, which one describes me best. Very straightforward again. 

- And here it talks about the Veterans personal information, identification information, pre-populated for the most part
- I do like the fact it has the asterisk in red, that it must be completed and is required

- Again more eligibility info, the Veteran’s stats
- Again the drop down with the definition of what a service connected disability is
- Perhaps the Veteran is deemed 100% disabled and not expected to improve, there may be some Veterans with 100% disability and could improve…

- TRICARE.. reads page out loud. Again it has a drop down how to check for TRICARE eligibility. There is 3 options, choices, yes no or perhaps this person doesn’t know if they are already enrolled in the DEERS program
- The dropdown for the TRICARE eligibility , the uniform service decides and it gets reported in the DEERS system, and a link you can click on to the DEERS website

- This says the CHAMPVA eligibility summary, based on the Veterans information the applicants may be eligible (reads gray box outloud)
- Veteran or applicant is not eligible for the TRICARE

- This one, everything is marked with the green check, so to me I would continue. 
- yes both of the prerequisites are marked (green check)
- (rating) 5, this one compared to the other one, the Pineapple, this one didn’t have any red X’s and it looks like it is clear cut I am eligible to proceed for applying for the CHAMPVA benefits.

- The blueberry (*preferred to use)
- This one seemed to be a little bit - it’s not confusing. Where the pineapple, had one section where the Veteran or family member was eligible, but then had that read X and the reason why they may not be eligible 
- This one is clear, based on the information I provided, a 100% go, totally eligible to continue applying 

- The right information
- Yes (confident and explaining to friend) Using the Blueberry prototype 



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
Alert A 
- It states app cannot confirm eligibility of applicants, and could not find Veterans info in system. 
- So I would then look for a button or drop down or link that I could go backwards and re-review all the information of the Veteran or spouse or dependent to ensure I completed the information properly.
- Sure (still apply) well it is just telling you they couldn’t find the information on the Veteran and go back and review the info you completed, so I would go back review and perhaps their were errors to correct and once I did that I would look for any alerts 

Alert B
- Again, they can’t confirm the eligibility of applicants
- Hmm.. so perhaps if they had a link you could click on that would take you to the beginning of the information, maybe errors made. Once those were corrected, then the program should allow me to go forth with the application.
- it’s kind of confusing to try again later or continue application, I really don’t like the alert B because it is try again later. Who wants to go back into an app, that is telling me the eligibility or the information wasn’t entered correctly and maybe the system is down, says try again later. OR the other choice to continue. It’s a bit confusing. I don’t prefer the verbiage in alert B
- When I see try again later, I’m thinking is the app down. I would be frustrated if I tried to go back into the app later and came up with the same scenario. 


Alert C
- (reads alert outloud)
- I would prefer that there was a link to take me backwards so I could review the information. Why wouldn’t you go back and re-verify your information. There is no sense in clicking continue, it is a waste of time. Says there is an error .
- wants this resolved before moving on


Alert D
- (reads alert outloud)
- So it is either one or the other. It is stating it did find the Veteran’s information and he is already enrolled in TRICARE and you can’t be in CHAMPVA if in TRICARE.
- If there was a little link to TRICARE, if it there, I would then if it said something like click here to go to TRICARE benefits. 
- Wants to be redirected to TRICARE



Alert E
- This says just based on the information provided, the applicants may be elfin. This one has the check mark and it is also in green - so you associate with go and proceed.
- Where the other alerts have the triangle with the exclamation point is to my hey read this and telling me what is wrong. And to review and resolve the issues. 


- (rating) Very confident , because it tells you whether or not you are eligible and for what program. 5

- The alert B, I didn’t care for the try again later OR select again later. Why would you select continue if it is giving you that icon that there is a warning there. And I don’t care for try again later.. don’t want to waste my time. 

- I like Alert A, it says the information of the applications can’t be confirmed for eligibility. If there was a drop down or link to go backwards and check information for accuracy. 
- Really Alert B, I don’t care for.


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Um, the left in card style A, it again has the green check marks and telling the applicant according to the responses they may be eligible for CHAMPVA. Also telling the Veteran or applicant they are NOT eligible for TRICARE. I do like that.
- the box on the right, that they MAY NOT be eligible according to the responses they entered. And apparently the Veteran qualifies based on service connected disability and then it is also telling me if we are applying for the CHAMPVA, the Veteran or applicant is NOT eligible for TRICARE. You can’t be in both programs it is one or the other. 

Card Style B
- Based on the information entered, the left box, again tells me, that they meet the prerequisite regarding the disability. Or the Veteran died from their disability or time rated permanently and totally disabled.
- And it also states the Veteran or applicants are NOT eligible for TRICARE

- The right side, these responses are the perquisites for CHAMPVA (reads through bullets in first itme)
- The bottom bullet the next sentence states, the red X tells me to stop, the Veteran or applicant is eligible for TRICARE. IT is telling me the top part that the meet CHAMPVA  but they are eligible for TRICARE. 

- (easier to understand at a glance) There is not (scrolls back and forth through the two)… are they the same?
- I would state card style B, because it states based on the information entered it is telling you the eligible for CHAMPVA, has checkmarks stating why eligible
Then it also states a summary of why they may not be eligible. The top portion shows they met some and that the Veteran or applicant is eligible for TRICARE. 

- no, but I like the Card style B because it is telling you, perhaps reminding you, that this is for CHAMPVA. You either met the eligibility or the information you entered you didn’t. 
- That little blurb is helpful



#### Post-Task Interview
- No (no other feedback)
- Perhaps if I was alerted on the spouse or the dependent child… I would prefer an email if the dependent/spouse/Veteran has given the VA permission to email. Based on the criteria the email states you may be eligible and spouse/dependents for CHAMPVA. Or maybe it’s for TRICARE, an email alerting the Veteran that they may be eligible for TRICARE. Take you to the different links
- Want to know what else qualifies for

- Sure (share clip)




#### Additional Notes**
- The participant cleared stated they understood it was an either or situation - the applicants can be eligible for TRICARE or CHAMPVA, but not both
- The participant misinterpreted the Pineapple prototype summary card in that it was telling them that they were not eligible for TRICARE when the opposite was true - but they answered very confident in their understanding
- The participant wanted more information or a link directed to TRICARE as a next step on that warning alert, but also wanted all warning alerts to have a resolution and would not proceed without fixing first
