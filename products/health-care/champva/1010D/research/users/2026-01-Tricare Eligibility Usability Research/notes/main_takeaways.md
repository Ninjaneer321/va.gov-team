## Session Summaries and Observer Top 3 Callouts

Main takeaway from the research sessions

#### P1

**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant mentioned calling CHAMPVA help number or TRICARE multiple times at confusion points in the flow instead of continuing on
- They wanted details and information on what eligibility was based on - not a system check on basic personal info
- There was confusion around the eligibility box and how it read within the context of the flow

**Observer 1:**
- seemed confused about tricare/champva connection at first, but seemed to be more clear as the study progressed
- not clear what the deciding factors were when denied
- wants less information overall - info pages, alerts (very concise, clear yes/no or actions are preferred)

**Observer 2:**
- Too much info on pages, prefers direct streamlined information
- Could be a 'winner's bias'  but was totally fine with the positive eligibility decision, and didnt ask about how it came to that, but did want to know more when he got the non-eligible decision
- Alerts/Summary - need to be very clear and direct
