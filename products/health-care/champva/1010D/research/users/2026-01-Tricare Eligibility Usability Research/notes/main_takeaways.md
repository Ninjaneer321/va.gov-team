## Session Summaries and Observer Top 3 Callouts

Main takeaway from the research sessions

### P1

**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant mentioned calling CHAMPVA help number or TRICARE multiple times at confusion points in the flow instead of continuing on
- They wanted details and information on what eligibility was based on - not a system check on basic personal info
- There was confusion around the eligibility box and how it read within the context of the flow

**Observer 1:**
- seemed confused about tricare/champva connection at first, but seemed to be more clear as the study progressed
- not clear what the deciding factors were when denied
- wants less information overall - info pages, alerts (very concise, clear yes/no or actions are preferred)

**Observer 2:**
- Too much info on pages, prefers direct streamlined information
- Could be a 'winner's bias'  but was totally fine with the positive eligibility decision, and didnt ask about how it came to that, but did want to know more when he got the non-eligible decision
- Alerts/Summary - need to be very clear and direct


### P2

**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant found the warning alert on the Pineapple prototype helpful and not intrusive but would still continue with application
- The eligibility summary box was confusing; unsure what the green check and red x meant. Preferred the alternate option B shown at the end of the study and stated the headline content specifically cleared that up for them.
- Found the link to DEERS helpful so they could look up and verify the information on their own

**Observer 1:**
- P2 did not have a clear preference between the 2 prototypes, but did prefer card style B and liked the mid-flow alert in Pineapple. Overall, wants clearer content in the design around eligibility criteria.
- Initially did not understand the eligibility criteria until going through both prototypes and seeing the differences in the flow
- Did not seem to think that the alerts (or ineligibility messaging) would stop him from applying, but it would give him some pause/concern about the outcome of his application.

**Observer 2:**
- Found the alert in Pineapple helpful, likes that the information is up front. Would still continue on but would be unsure if they should (because of their confusion with the red X)
- Preferred card style B. Previously in the Pineapple flow seemed to think that the text within the grey eligibility summary was referring to the applicant and whatever they filled out in the form (i.e. "The Veteran or applicants is not eligible for TRICARE") instead of being the general eligibility language
- Grouped alert options A, B, and C together. Assumed they were all system errors (i.e. not a user entry error but I guess the participant wasn't entering information on their own in the prototype and probably assumed all the pre-entered information was correct)


#### P3
**UX Notetaker:**
- Had no preference between prototypes blueberry and pineapple, which came down to confusion over the scenario/task vs. her real-life circumstances. However, if faced with an alert that said she was NOT eligible, she said would continue with the application (may be a reflection of knowing her real-life eligibility). 
- Preferred Card Style A because it was more concise. - Wanted the ability to find more information and research the areas on the eligibility summary checklist on her own time.
- Expressed a lot of concern with Alert C and the possibility that the VA had lost her Veteran's information. The lack of specificity in the alert style seemed distressing, to her.

**Observer 1:**
- Aware of the eligibility choice between CHAMPVA and Tricare - had to make that choice when they signed up for the Caregiver program, decided to stay with Tricare due to convenience and already getting coverage/medications
- Later in prototype blueberry the eligibility pattern and the participants own situation (not fake info) was giving them a hard time, difficult to explain way - due to it being the opposite of their real life situation
- Gave the eligibility review pattern a 1 out of 5 rating for ease of understanding
