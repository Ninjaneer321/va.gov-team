## Session Summaries and Observer Top 3 Callouts

Main takeaway from the research sessions

### P1

**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant mentioned calling CHAMPVA help number or TRICARE multiple times at confusion points in the flow instead of continuing on
- They wanted details and information on what eligibility was based on - not a system check on basic personal info
- There was confusion around the eligibility box and how it read within the context of the flow

**Observer 1:**
- seemed confused about tricare/champva connection at first, but seemed to be more clear as the study progressed
- not clear what the deciding factors were when denied
- wants less information overall - info pages, alerts (very concise, clear yes/no or actions are preferred)

**Observer 2:**
- Too much info on pages, prefers direct streamlined information
- Could be a 'winner's bias'  but was totally fine with the positive eligibility decision, and didnt ask about how it came to that, but did want to know more when he got the non-eligible decision
- Alerts/Summary - need to be very clear and direct


### P2

**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant found the warning alert on the Pineapple prototype helpful and not intrusive but would still continue with application
- The eligibility summary box was confusing; unsure what the green check and red x meant. Preferred the alternate option B shown at the end of the study and stated the headline content specifically cleared that up for them.
- Found the link to DEERS helpful so they could look up and verify the information on their own

**Observer 1:**
- P2 did not have a clear preference between the 2 prototypes, but did prefer card style B and liked the mid-flow alert in Pineapple. Overall, wants clearer content in the design around eligibility criteria.
- Initially did not understand the eligibility criteria until going through both prototypes and seeing the differences in the flow
- Did not seem to think that the alerts (or ineligibility messaging) would stop him from applying, but it would give him some pause/concern about the outcome of his application.

**Observer 2:**
- Found the alert in Pineapple helpful, likes that the information is up front. Would still continue on but would be unsure if they should (because of their confusion with the red X)
- Preferred card style B. Previously in the Pineapple flow seemed to think that the text within the grey eligibility summary was referring to the applicant and whatever they filled out in the form (i.e. "The Veteran or applicants is not eligible for TRICARE") instead of being the general eligibility language
- Grouped alert options A, B, and C together. Assumed they were all system errors (i.e. not a user entry error but I guess the participant wasn't entering information on their own in the prototype and probably assumed all the pre-entered information was correct)


#### P3
**UX Notetaker:**
- Had no preference between prototypes blueberry and pineapple, which came down to confusion over the scenario/task vs. her real-life circumstances. However, if faced with an alert that said she was NOT eligible, she said would continue with the application (may be a reflection of knowing her real-life eligibility). 
- Preferred Card Style A because it was more concise. - Wanted the ability to find more information and research the areas on the eligibility summary checklist on her own time.
- Expressed a lot of concern with Alert C and the possibility that the VA had lost her Veteran's information. The lack of specificity in the alert style seemed distressing, to her.

**Observer 1:**
- Aware of the eligibility choice between CHAMPVA and Tricare - had to make that choice when they signed up for the Caregiver program, decided to stay with Tricare due to convenience and already getting coverage/medications
- Later in prototype blueberry the eligibility pattern and the participants own situation (not fake info) was giving them a hard time, difficult to explain way - due to it being the opposite of their real life situation
- Gave the eligibility review pattern a 1 out of 5 rating for ease of understanding

#### P4
**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant preferred Blueberry prototype because it seemed simpler without duplicative information
- They would want to be presented with information on how to correct anything they thought was incorrect, they didn't want to just continue on but would want to call and resolve errors
- They preferred the alternate B style to the eligibility pattern that has dynamic headers and intro text but did seem to understand and react positively to the green checks and red x's used in the pattern

**Observer 1:**
- Veterans love to give feedback.
- Green checkmarks are a win.
- Unclear what to do if they didn't agree with the precheck.

**Observer 2:**
- Participant was very confident in their prior understanding of the program and skipped over text explaining the differences and who could apply until getting into the form AND seeing the alerts/checkboxes.
- Preference for less repeated information unless it was clearly explaining the "why" behind something and a "what's next".
- Green means go. Orange means yelling.

#### P5 - no show

#### P6
**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant stated is was clear that if they were eligible for TRICARE they would not be eligible for CHAMVPA
- Found the alerts to be clear overall but stated that some, because of the intro sentence, made it seem like it was a VA system issue and not an eligibility check issue
- Wants a hybrid approach on the eligibility pattern gray box - stating the outcome in the headline and the responses, not a summary, below. They found the icons, list and visual representation helpful.

**Observer 1:**
- Participant found the green check marks helpful in the summary cards ("green checks mean good to go!"). But the last bullet point about TRICARE eligibility coupled with a green check or red X "feels paradoxical" and gave them pause. I do want to experiment with the realtime content feedback they shared about improving the summary cards!
- Participant was keen on wanting to learn about CHAMPVA benefits and what services to expect (vs. simply eligibility and application process info) on the intro page.
- Participant liked that the eligibility pattern alerts were orange (vs. red and alarming) and found them helpful: "It's just telling me to slow down."

**Observer 2:**
- Participant preferred to be prepared and know everything up front rather than find out they needed something later (consistently clicked the more information dropdowns, noted expecting the VA to state what documents and info would be needed before starting, eyes directly to DD-214 form and recognizing it was NOT needed).
- Preferred when information had clear why's behind it so they did not need to interpret what might be going wrong or wonder if it was a system issue.
- Some potential difficulty identifying requirements vs. responses on the last card but preferred written out Version B or a hybrid.

#### P7

**UX Notetaker:**
- No strong preference for either prototype, but P7 did want to stop the application if she got an "ineligible" message to talk to her sponsor and a representative to make sure this wasn't a mistake or fix any problems before proceeding with the application
- Had issues with the double negative in summary card style A, felt that card style B aligned more with her comprehension of TRICARE and CHAMPVA eligibility
- Wanted slightly more bolding or green/red alerts to really let users know "green means go, red means no" for the eligibility information.

**Observer 1:**
- Participant seemed confident that is was clear that if you were eligible for Tricare you could not be eligible for CHAMPVA (noticed on the intro page and within the eligibility pattern)
- The participant preferred eligibility card option B where the content was changed in context; the default wording with the red x was confusing and unclear to them
- They seemed to view the alerts as informative and not blocking, but did mention wanting a person to talk to when a warning alert would appear if they were completing the form


#### P8

**UX Notetaker:**
- It was clear to them if they qualify for TRICARE the are not eligible for CHAMPVA and they caught that on the intro page
- The double negative statement on the default eligibility review box was confusing for them, they preferred alternate option B
- For most alerts would follow the same process - double check inputted information then reach out. They did state they would schedule an appt with the VA eligibility and enrollment office

**Observer 1:**
- P8 had no prior knowledge of CHAMPVA, but was easily able to grasp the eligibility requirements for the program based on the intro and static pages. 
- P8 had no preference for prototypes but did prefer Card Style B for clarity of language. 
- Notable in P8's session was how often she wouldn't exit the application, but would prefer to save in progress to troubleshoot. This came up with regards to system errors as well as summaries of the eligibility.



#### P9

**UX Notetaker:**
- Would like to know his eligibility at the front end so he does not have to waste his time with any additional processes.
- Prefers multiple ‘vectors’ at blocking point (warning alerts) so he can reach out to the personnel to quickly confirm the situation or information
- Commented on the naurnce of language, noting that many of the content uses the word “may” so if he was in a situation where he really wanted health care for his dependent, he we go through the form to have a “true determination” from an actual person.


**Observer 1:**
- Overall the participant was focused on efficiency and having information presented upfront and as early as possible. He did not want to waste his time.
- Participant liked visual symbols to help relay information, such as checks and x, bullets, and call out boxes to increase scanability, readability, and call his attention. 
- He wanted to have options for next steps and actions, he didn't want the experience to be a dead end. He wanted to know what to do next and have that information presented the first time an ineligibility alert was presented.

**Observer 2:**
- Participant was well aware of TRICARE, but understood yet was unaware that you couldn't be eligible for CHAMPVA too
- Participant appreciated the alert and the check in DEERS but would like an action (links to check, phone number to call, facilities to visit) for those that need to resolve an incorrect data issue
- Pineapple was preferred because they were informed earlier


#### P10

**UX Notetaker:**
- Wasn't clear to the participant that if they were eligible for TRICARE they couldn't get CHAMPVA until after the eligibility summary screen in the second prototype (Blueberry). They stated they may have missed that in the intro page content but it should be bold and called out more.
- The gray eligibility summary card was confusing for them: double negative great quote: 
> The second card, says may NOT be eligible, and the difference is the Veteran or applicant is not.. wait a second what? I’m so confused. (Re reads the last bullet) What in the trick-ness is going on here? What? The x’s and checks I don’t even know what they mean anymore

- The alert mentioning that the Veteran information was found in DEERS was also re-read by the participant a few times, stated they wanted a link or more information here in addition to re-wording to be more clear

**Observer 1:**
- Initially, participant was unsure of why the start of the form gently informed them to not submit ineligible applications, then proceeded to say that despite alerts of ineligibility, that they'd just keep continuing with the application. "If the continue button is still there, I'm gonna click it just to see what happens!"
- The form eligibility summary card in the first prototype (pineapple) was completely misinterpreted, at least initially. Participant didn't realize that their responses in the form so far was informing what the card was saying and telling them that they aren't eligible, so they found it confusing and felt like they were receiving mixed messages. The card was still up for interpretation for the participant and they said they'd just continue anyway.
- Despite all the alerts and info provided, participant stated multiple times that they'd still probably go back though "the websites" and deep dive on more information on TRICARE and CHAMPVA and how they relate to get confirmation on their eligibility.
- Bonus takeaway: I got the feeling that the way the final task with the Summary cards was laid out overwhelmed the participant and they were ready to dip. They were able to discern the differences between the two card styles, but ultimately seemed like they were unsure of what was being asked of them. "I feel like I'm in an escape room and I'm not figuring out the way out here." Though upon further questioning, and maybe abandoning all the other wording and green checkmarks and red Xs, they focused in on that extra sentence in the Card Style B and found clarity.



#### P11

**UX Notetaker:**

- Participant felt the alert in Pineapple prototype and Alert D to be confusing when mentioning TRICARE/CHAMPVA eligibility. They wanted contact information provided in the alert to reach out in addition to changes to content or visual icons.
- The participant didn't have any issues with the pattern eligibility summary cards, but did prefer Option B due to the extra sentence adding clarity of eligibility
- Still the participant preferred the Pineapple prototype and appreciated being informed of eligibility earlier in the process, they just wanted it explained and more clear as to why and who they could contact

**Observer 1:**
- Iconography helped with understanding of eligibility
- Desire to have a contact method for confirmation of eligibility - Phone or chat. *Less information on the page adds to quick comprehension and clarity * Users will still proceed even if eligibility is questionable.  Having capability to immediately inform users of their eligibility with minimal content and clear messaging with supporting iconography is desirable, and may prevent unnecessary contact with the VA


#### P12

**UX Notetaker:**
- The wording and double negative in the gray eligibility patter was confusing for the participant, but they did rate the eligibility summary page as a 5 out 5 for understanding but they were interpreting backwards due to the double negative
- The participant understood the intro page content and the concept that if you are eligible for TRICARE you can't also be eligible for CHAMPVA but would appricate a link to sign up with Tricare when those DEERS alerts were shown
- the red "x"'s overall in the eligibility pattern seemed to be confusing for the participant, mentioning that is not their preference

**Observer 1:**
1 - double negatives were very confusing
2 - wanted a hyperlink to tricare (either to check for availability or once they've determined they're ineligible for cva because they are eligible for tricare)
3 - immediately knew the validation was checking deers, not surprised by any of that portion

**Observer 2:**
- Double negative Iconography was confusing for the user in understanding whether they were eligible or not * If not eligible for CHAMPVA, they would like direct linkage to TRICARE to be able to apply. * User mentioned having ability to contact the VA if their information wasn't correct. * Blueberry prototype, although preferred, still provided ambiguity around eligibility, but user would proceed
- Statement at the top of Summary card B adds clarity

#### P13

**UX Notetaker:**
- double negative is not good
- previous experience with deers was helpful
- very nervous about alerts saying she couldnt be found in system -  seemed to think that it may be shes not in system at all, would immediately call

**Observer 1:**
- Participant was confused by the eligibility review box and interpreted the red X and TRICARE eligibility as being the opposite of what they entered. At the end they noted they preferred the alternative card summary B as it clarify the confusion.
- They called out that the prototypes were for different eligibility scenarios so it was difficult to pick a preference, but noted they would continue on in both scenarios to see what would happen next in the application
- The participant found the alert options to be a mix of clear and confusing - most of the confusion was around wanting additional clarity of what system was being checked and what benefit eligibility was being referenced.

**Observer 2:**
- Participant like the eligibility checks up front as a way to save time and determine if they wanted to move forward.
- She would seek out DEERs to get questions answered vs. going to the VA. But if there was information that didn't align with what she expected, she would seek out answers first many times before proceeding with the application.
- The language around not being eligible due to TRICARE on the cards was really confusing. And she wanted clarification on what program the eligibility was in reference to.
- Bonus: not being found in the VA system was such as terrible experience


#### P14

**UX Notetaker:**
- non-definitive language was a big hang up (wanted more clarity)
- wanted more communication between dod and va (expressed desire for tricare to have the vet info already if they determined they were eligible for tricare as part of the cva enrollment)
- knows that sometimes va has wrong information on their side, so if she got an answer that they weren't found and she's confident everything is correct, she'd continue


**Observer 1:**
- The double negative and the red X on the eligibility summary card was confusing (for another participant) 
- The color coding and icons were appreciated throughout - both in the alerts and the icons as easy visuals when scanning - even if they were getting tripped up in the exact content. 
- The non-definitive language around the eligibility outcomes was called out as a negative and they mentioned wanting a connection to TRICARE for those who are eligible but not enrolled making it easier for them to get health coverage somewhere


**Observer 2:**
- Speak in definitive statements removing ambiguity, and eliminate double negatives
- * Be sensitive removing to the best of your knowledge.
- * Ability to save and return to finish application is desirable. * Would like better connectivity between DOD and VA systems to facilitate smoother access to benefits.
- * Statement on Card style B was helpful in understanding eligibility (user did initially miss the sentence though). Desires an actionable link to Tricare and a seamless departure from CHAMPVA to get enrolled in TRICARE if not CHAMPVA eligible
