## Session Summaries and Observer Top 3 Callouts

Main takeaway from the research sessions

### P1

**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant mentioned calling CHAMPVA help number or TRICARE multiple times at confusion points in the flow instead of continuing on
- They wanted details and information on what eligibility was based on - not a system check on basic personal info
- There was confusion around the eligibility box and how it read within the context of the flow

**Observer 1:**
- seemed confused about tricare/champva connection at first, but seemed to be more clear as the study progressed
- not clear what the deciding factors were when denied
- wants less information overall - info pages, alerts (very concise, clear yes/no or actions are preferred)

**Observer 2:**
- Too much info on pages, prefers direct streamlined information
- Could be a 'winner's bias'  but was totally fine with the positive eligibility decision, and didnt ask about how it came to that, but did want to know more when he got the non-eligible decision
- Alerts/Summary - need to be very clear and direct


### P2

**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant found the warning alert on the Pineapple prototype helpful and not intrusive but would still continue with application
- The eligibility summary box was confusing; unsure what the green check and red x meant. Preferred the alternate option B shown at the end of the study and stated the headline content specifically cleared that up for them.
- Found the link to DEERS helpful so they could look up and verify the information on their own

**Observer 1:**
- P2 did not have a clear preference between the 2 prototypes, but did prefer card style B and liked the mid-flow alert in Pineapple. Overall, wants clearer content in the design around eligibility criteria.
- Initially did not understand the eligibility criteria until going through both prototypes and seeing the differences in the flow
- Did not seem to think that the alerts (or ineligibility messaging) would stop him from applying, but it would give him some pause/concern about the outcome of his application.

**Observer 2:**
- Found the alert in Pineapple helpful, likes that the information is up front. Would still continue on but would be unsure if they should (because of their confusion with the red X)
- Preferred card style B. Previously in the Pineapple flow seemed to think that the text within the grey eligibility summary was referring to the applicant and whatever they filled out in the form (i.e. "The Veteran or applicants is not eligible for TRICARE") instead of being the general eligibility language
- Grouped alert options A, B, and C together. Assumed they were all system errors (i.e. not a user entry error but I guess the participant wasn't entering information on their own in the prototype and probably assumed all the pre-entered information was correct)


#### P3
**UX Notetaker:**
- Had no preference between prototypes blueberry and pineapple, which came down to confusion over the scenario/task vs. her real-life circumstances. However, if faced with an alert that said she was NOT eligible, she said would continue with the application (may be a reflection of knowing her real-life eligibility). 
- Preferred Card Style A because it was more concise. - Wanted the ability to find more information and research the areas on the eligibility summary checklist on her own time.
- Expressed a lot of concern with Alert C and the possibility that the VA had lost her Veteran's information. The lack of specificity in the alert style seemed distressing, to her.

**Observer 1:**
- Aware of the eligibility choice between CHAMPVA and Tricare - had to make that choice when they signed up for the Caregiver program, decided to stay with Tricare due to convenience and already getting coverage/medications
- Later in prototype blueberry the eligibility pattern and the participants own situation (not fake info) was giving them a hard time, difficult to explain way - due to it being the opposite of their real life situation
- Gave the eligibility review pattern a 1 out of 5 rating for ease of understanding

#### P4
**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant preferred Blueberry prototype because it seemed simpler without duplicative information
- They would want to be presented with information on how to correct anything they thought was incorrect, they didn't want to just continue on but would want to call and resolve errors
- They preferred the alternate B style to the eligibility pattern that has dynamic headers and intro text but did seem to understand and react positively to the green checks and red x's used in the pattern

**Observer 1:**
- Veterans love to give feedback.
- Green checkmarks are a win.
- Unclear what to do if they didn't agree with the precheck.

**Observer 2:**
- Participant was very confident in their prior understanding of the program and skipped over text explaining the differences and who could apply until getting into the form AND seeing the alerts/checkboxes.
- Preference for less repeated information unless it was clearly explaining the "why" behind something and a "what's next".
- Green means go. Orange means yelling.




#### P5




#### P6
**UX Notetaker:**
- Participant stated is was clear that if they were eligible for TRICARE they would not be eligible for CHAMVPA
- Found the alerts to be clear overall but stated that some, because of the intro sentence, made it seem like it was a VA system issue and not an eligibility check issue
- Wants a hybrid approach on the eligibility pattern gray box - stating the outcome in the headline and the responses, not a summary, below. They found the icons, list and visual representation helpful.

**Observer 1:**
- Participant found the green check marks helpful in the summary cards ("green checks mean good to go!"). But the last bullet point about TRICARE eligibility coupled with a green check or red X "feels paradoxical" and gave them pause. I do want to experiment with the realtime content feedback they shared about improving the summary cards!
- Participant was keen on wanting to learn about CHAMPVA benefits and what services to expect (vs. simply eligibility and application process info) on the intro page.
- Participant liked that the eligibility pattern alerts were orange (vs. red and alarming) and found them helpful: "It's just telling me to slow down."

**Observer 2:**
- Participant preferred to be prepared and know everything up front rather than find out they needed something later (consistently clicked the more information dropdowns, noted expecting the VA to state what documents and info would be needed before starting, eyes directly to DD-214 form and recognizing it was NOT needed).
- Preferred when information had clear why's behind it so they did not need to interpret what might be going wrong or wonder if it was a system issue.
- Some potential difficulty identifying requirements vs. responses on the last card but preferred written out Version B or a hybrid.
