#### Introduction
- consents to recording
- consents to sharing a recording of the sesions

#### Warm-up Questions
- Has not applied to CHAMPVA before
- Has heard of CHAMPVA but doesn't know any details or characteristics of the program
- Has heard of Tricare
- Differences: the type of coverage, cost-sharing program like health insurance. The differences could be the percentage of what's covered

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- This looks like your standard homepage/landing page for the CHAMPVA benefits application. Gives a good bit of information and steps to prepare for the application.
- Who is eligible: spouses, dependents or survivors or Veterans (reads the intro text at the top of the page)
- May not be eligible: scrolls to check eligibility step, identifies Tricare eligible. Exactly what details go into that eligibility, I'm not sure.
- I would click on the "find out if you're eligible" link to get more information on who is/is not qualified for CHAMPVA benefits. But notes again that one disqualifying item is having Tricare
- Uncertain about applying? No, it's a fairly concise overview of what the application process looks like, examples of documents you may need. I like that it tells you how long it'll take and next steps. Nothing concerning in my opinion
- I would want more information regarding what exactly the CHAMPVA benefits would look like, what CHAMPVA entails. I don't see anywhere here that focuses on what CHAMPVA is, specifically. It's just the application process and eligibility. Not what the tangible benefits are.
- Rating: if I had all the context about CHAMPVA benefits and just focused on the content on the intro page, it's a 5. Related to the application process itself, there's quite a bit of information.
- Not knowing where this exact page lives on VA.gov, there could be another page focused on the actual CHAMPVA benefits.
- I would proceed to the application with the information


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- So far very basic info (based on Veteran's information screen)
- Reads the alert on the Veteran's information screen
- I love (the alert). If I'm not eligible, I'd rather know up front and not waste my time going through a lengthier application if I'm not able to apply/enroll
- Helpful, not intrusive. It's up-front and honest, right away.
- Accurate: good question. I trust that it's accurate. There might be a case where they might find the Veteran's information in DEERS and it's not accurate...I find it to be accurate.
- If you knew it was wrong: I would still continue, I think you're still able to continue the application. And if I see the application is denied and I feel that it's incorrect, I'd look for contact information and reach out via telephone.
- System: It says "MAY NOT" be eligible. But the continue button isn't closed off, it's just a heads up. It's not blocking me.
- Stepper: would prefer it would move to step 2 after saying the Veteran's information wasn't eligible
- Clicks the "how do we define service-connected disability" and reads the explanation. "Makes sense."
- Eligibility for TRICARE page: clicks "how to check for TRICARE eligibility" info component. Likes the link to double-check the initial alert around eligibility.
- Eligibility summary: I think this is confusing right here. Based on the Veteran the applicants may not be eligible? The check mark and the X I don't fully understand the point of view. Which response is invalidating your eligibility?
- Knows if you're eligible for TRICARE you're not eligible for CHAMPVA
- Thrown off by the way the icons are framed respective to the content. I would think with the X that I'm not eligible for TRICARE, which should be a good thing.
- What is the system telling you about eligibility: I'm not sure. I think it's that I'm not eligible, but I'm not exactly sure why. I think the system says I didn't meet this criteria "not eligible for TRICARE."
- Confidence rating: I'm like 50-50
- Next steps: I would continue the application but I would have some doubts about whether I'm even eligible for it.
- SEQ: 2. It's a little confusing based on how you view the gray box.



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Seems pretty much the same so far, but I see there's no popup about eligibility
- Gray box: yeah so now I see that the system is telling me the criteria didn't match with the "X"
- The context is the same as prototype pineapple, but now I understand the difference between eligibile and ineligible
- I would take the same action: continue the application
- Comprehension: 5, it's easier to understand if you "may be eligible" and the options are green. (admits they are identical)
- Preference: What's the difference? They're the same.
- Amount of information: just the right amount. I definitely don't want too much, it adds to confusion.
- Explaining this to a friend: Yes I'd feel confident doing so.



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Alert A: you can't the applicant in the system overall (not just in DEERS, but you entered someone who isn't a Veteran or there's no record of them). Says this applies to Alerts A, B, and C. If I know the person I'm applying with I would continue on. I'd assume this was a system error. 
- Alert D: I still would proceed with the application, honestly. No additional information needed...or maybe I'd like to see a hyperlink to checking DEERS (recalls the additional info component).
- Confidence: 4, but I'm not quite sure about Alerts A-C. I would want a little bit more information. Relatively confident in them. 


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Prefers Card Style B over Card Style A. The like "Your responses..." clears up all of the confusion. It makes the "X" make sense.
- Card style B: tells you you didn't meet all of the criteria. It's like a checklist.
- Nothing about card style B is confusing or doesn't make any sense. 



#### Post-Task Interview
- Nothing to add, just want the added clarity in the summary cards and alerts
- Wants the eligibility information to be upfront. The wording just needs to be cleaned up.
