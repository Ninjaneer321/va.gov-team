#### Introduction
- I’ve heard of it, my mom uses it with her partner. 

You can only use it if TDIU or Permanent and Total

Have you ever heard of Tricare and Champva? I think tricare is the insurance that just works and is primary. But CHAMPVA is secondary that works as like a backup from your existing insurance. If I had job insurance and then my disability rating made me eligible I couldn’t completely switch over. 

#### Warm-up Questions
- Notes

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ 1] Prototype PINEAPPLE

What does this mean to you
This looks like the standard VA website
This goes for how you apply for it if you are the dependent. It’ll check if my dependent is eligible. Tells me the documents and I can click them and then Step 3 will let me start if I start. 

Families of Veterans who are 100% P&T
It’s all pretty straightforward. I can click to see what other documents I would need. So if I was applying…I would sign in or have my wife sign in. Then I would check eligibility and make sure I had all my documents 

Reviewing the TOC

Primarily eligibility blue box. But it doesn’t tell you the VA disability and I know there’s a difference between TDIU vs 100 P&T. Decision letter says the specifics, so if someone wasn’t sure they could find out. 

4.5 or strong 4 for feeling prepared. It has everything on there - it does have the link - but it doesn’t give you what you need to know if you really qualify. Instead of looking at a page to take you to a page to take you to another page. 


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

It looks like all of this is speaking to the dependent. Oh, now I’m seeing from the veteran’s perspective. 
It says it’s because of Tricare. 

I’m used to the VA’s orange box of notification. It’s yelling politely. Not red so it’s not shouting at me. 
I would trust this alert. 
The only thing it gives me to do is continue. So I would see what the next page tells me. 

Need some guidance and an exit path. For disagreement. This isn’t explaining why or contact someone to find out what my next step would be.

Right now it’s blocking me from applying. I understand what it’s saying, but if I disagreed, I can’t see what my options would be. 

Reviewing summary page
Read through, focused on continue for elegibility 
It says in one way you are eligible and in one way you are not.

Out of these 3 checkmarks I only meet 1  not the other. 
I would exit unless I disagree because my dependents weren’t on Tricare. 
I’m pretty confident, it’s straightforward now after the previous couple of pages. But this one answers them perfectly. 
5 it’s super easy to understand.




#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- So far it is the same, I just checked the Tricare and it says any of the same ones. 

5 very easy. It had less continues. I noticed. 
I prefer blueberry, it was simpler and faster. Once it imported the veterans information it goes right into the application. It feels like there was an additional 2 pages of continues to answer on the other one. 

I like this better, if there was a red x that would be better. 
I’d say the first one the extra alert message. We obsesss about details and information. So having an additional screen with additional info that is ALSO found on this page can be confusing. So I like this page because it has the right information without repeating itself. 



#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- Notes



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Notes
Alert A: VA doesn’t have my account and is missing service information. I would want to fix the warning, I would call the 1800 number. Tell me what’s missing and let me resolve it. 
I came to the website to do something, if I’m getting an error I’d like to resolve it.

Alert B: I would click continue and then give it a couple days and then call. The VA portal might have something wrong with it. 

Alert C: Maybe I mixed up numbers in the social so I would double check. I would call the VA. 

Alert D: I would only need more info if I knew for a fact this wasn’t true. Everyone in Tricare knows they are unless it’s a child. Otherwise ok with this message

Alert e: Green means go. 

#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Notes
Card Style
They look very similar to me.

Style B- I see, it has the extra information saying may be eligible or won’t be. It’s concrete. I think the extra detail is important. 




#### Post-Task Interview
I like both of them but I like Blueberry better because it seemed smoother cleaner, and it didn’t have double information. 
Older Veterans read every line, so for people who might confuse themselves, you need to have the extra line. 
I like the green checks and red x.
