#### Introduction
- N/A

#### Warm-up Questions
- Have not applied for CHAMPVA but heard of it
- Retired in 2019, have TRICARE benefits, have 100% service disability
- Comparing Champva vs Tricare, eligibility was better in Tricare, and it uses civilian doctors
- Using a laptop
- In the Cyber industry

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [X Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- It looks familiar, has 3 kids, looking for the best options
- Commented that he did not know that have tricare means you cannot get Champva
- VSlogon is very confusing
- This page is for health benefit for spouse or dependent
- Point to the “check eligibility” if not sure about eligibility
- Checking; are they using AI or is there a checkbox? Find it interesting.
- If you’re questioning if you’re eligible, then this gives you a reassurance. 
- Commented that he is eligible for Tricare, so he would not apply today.
- Would like a phone number to ask a quick question (like to check it at the start not the end)
- Rate the intro page a 4.8/5. 5/5 for rounding. But not missing a phone number. 
- Notes that in the military, they love lists, links, 


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- Quickly clicked through the questions
- Summary Check “based on my input, I’m eligible for Champva”
- Green check = good to go, x = not good.
- I’m a simple guy, if I see a green check based on my input, it means i’m good to go
- noticed that the title said “may be eligible.” 
- Rate the summary page 5/5 



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [X] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Like that first page note the user does not have to upload DD214, commented that multiple application ask for it to be uploaded
- API Check: It is good. It automatically checks it
- Comments his familiarity with the DEERS system and expect all vets to know it as well
- Notes that the API check would save him  a lot of time
- Very helpful, save me the time if I’m not certain with my eligibility
- Trust the system is accurate but comment that there is always exception (95% accurate) due to human error
- Would “crease the application” after seeing the alert
- If he believes the message is wrong, he wants a phone number to reach out to the offices (ID offices)
- Would prefer a link to find ID/DEERS office to make an appointment
- Would like a “couple of vectors would be nice”
- At this point, it would be a block because it did not provide options
- Pointed out the message did say “may” 
- Would like the TRICARE eligibility link at the API check.


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- The red x is always bad
- At this point I would think i’m not eligible
- Depends on how he feels about his eligibility at DEERS. If he knows he's eligible for DEERS, he would exit. If he were in a different situation, like looking for health care for his dependent, he would continue until someone stops him
- Rating 5/5
- Prefer the second ones (Pineapple) because he sees the links for Tricare eligibility, but comments that it is the “office meme” of the same photo
- Comment that it is like putting 10 lbs into 5lbs, the right amount of information
- Confidence in explaining to a friend, and you can continue the application
- Noted that a “true determination” of eligibility would require them to go through the application with a person reviewing the application. 



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- Alert A: Frustrating alert because his information is correct. Stuck in a loop.
- Alert B: Same thoughts, frustrating. Is this a server issue, something I need to come back to? Sometimes just close out and come back to it. Frustrating but understandable. 
- Alert C: goes back to Alert A, but would continue if the application lets me continue. It depends on what the instruction of the alert is. Probably continue because it could not be confirmed.
- Alert D: Mentioned earlier, loves the alert because it is informative, but wants several vectors (instrucitons on what to do next). Really like the alert. 
- Alert E: green is good, i’m continuing.
- Depending on the response, if I was able to continue, okay thats great. 
- The one that said you can try again later, that is most likely a server issue.
- Alert A is frustrating, especially since he served 25 years. 
- Wants link to actionable stuff. 


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- Comment that the subheading for card style B is very definitive, very helpful.
- Comment that the checkbox and x should align



#### Post-Task Interview
- How shold eligibility be added to online form? Intraoperative, between DEERS and the form be very helpful.

#### Additional Notes**
- 3 takeways
- Would like to know his eligibility at the front end so he does not have to waste his time with any additional processes.
- Prefers multiple ‘vectors’ at blocking point so he can reach out to the personnel to quickly confirm the situation or information
- Commented on the naurnce of language, noting that many of the content uses the word “may” so if he was in a situation where he really wanted health care for his dependent, he we go through the form to have a “true determination” from an actual person.
