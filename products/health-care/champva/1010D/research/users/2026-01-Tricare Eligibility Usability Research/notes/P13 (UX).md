#### Introduction
- comfortable with recording
- comfortable with sharing clips
- 

#### Warm-up Questions
- Has heard of cva
- not 100% on eligibility, but from what shes heard it's for eligible vets' families that are not able to have healthcare under other circumstances.
- not 100% positivie, but thinks they have to be 100% disabled
- has heard of tricare
- tricare = active duty and dependents, those are retired and dependents, does not have to be service connected
- cva is for those not connected to tricare and so families can have medical care
- 

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- in own words: application is for those who want to apply for cva and it will allow them to check eligibility
- lets them know that if you are eligible for tricare, you wouldnt be for cva
- tells them you will need ohi and other supporting docs
- scrolled through with little hesitation
- spouses or dependents or survivors are eligible
- when asked why they wouldnt be eligible, they said no, but previously had mentioned tricare
- would follow link for "find out if you're elibilge..."
- expectation for "we'll check your eligiblity" - that part was actually confusing to her when reading
- she expects if you didnt check before, the form would ask a few questions that would determine their eligiblity and let you know
- maybe reservists wouldnt be eligible? but they shouldnt be rated yet
- would she continue - it would depend on how much research she had done previously.  there's so much information that shes not sure if it's accurate, so she'd want to check
- she would definitely check eligibility requirements before applying
- how informed - 5/5 - likes how it was put together.  Sometimes va has too much info on the page, so you can get confused or "brain fog"
- besides the grey area of the reservist, everything is organized well
- 


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- likes that it's checking for eligibility, but that was a grey area
- she didn't expect that it would be in this format, but does like that it's here
- mentioned that it may not let you move forward without being eligible (on first eligibily screener page)
- pretty clearn on "your information"
- read through alert thoroughly
- from what shes reading, if you're eligible for tricare, you wouldnt be eligible for cva, so that clears it  up for her
- she did clarify that she had quite a bit more knowledge of deers and what that means for veterans and active members
- someone else may not be as familiar as she is with deers
- she tries to avoid giving out too much knowledge as she wants others to do their own research
- she likes the automate check, what's to do as little of possible
- felt it was easy/helpful
- trusted information was accurate, but if they felt there was an issue (one-offs), they may want to fight that determination a bit
- because it says continue, she would continue just to see what happens
- if she thought it was wrong (she wwasnt eligbible for tricare) - she would go to deers location and address it there
- but alot of people will default to va first
- she would continue and address the eligibility concern at the end if it didnt within the application
- helping you understand or blocking: it's explaining very well why she's not eligible
- sees the link to check for tricare eligibilty, which is convenient
- had to go back to review the "eligibiklty for tricare" page after seeing the "based on the veteran's infor"
- The x with the "not eligible for tricare" is confusing as she had marked yes that she was eligiible
- she wouldnt know what to do next based on what is shown because it's contradictory - she marked yes, but it's saying x by not eligible for tricare
- from what she understands, if you're eligible for tricare, you are not eligible for cva
- green checkmark says that she meets the requirement for disability level (one of the three is true) and the red x indicates that she has indicated that she's not eligible for tricare (even though she had said yes)
- not confident now whether she is eligible or not because of the final alert
- thinks maybe just one person is eligible and others arent?
- She would go check deers to see who is eligible
- if she was applying today, she'd go back to check tricare
- depending on that, she'd probably continue
- 2/5 - harder side - content/messaging is hard.  green check mark and red x are confusing even if its supposed to be her answers



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Notes


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- caught the last sentence this round
- now that she's seeing it, she does think maybe it would change a bit - empathetic people might consider how this would affect others being in this line. others wouldnt care and would just continue
- would expect that she would go forward after the question about tricare eligibilty answering no
- both green check marks, feels like she'd be good to continue because they both align with what she marked (100% disabled, not eligible for tricare)
- didnt see alert telling her she was in deers, so this makes sense
- 5/5 easy to understand
- prefers blueberry
- the other one had flagged that she wasn't eligible in the alert
- asked if the information was different or the same - we clarified that the information was different
- becuase the answers were different last time, there was no alert, so this situation was easier scenario
- went back to see see if the alert was missing - this version didnt have the link to check the eligiiblty ahead of time
- wants ability to check before
- this prototype was good and provided a good amount of info
- would feel confident explaining to a friend
- 



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- a - would give her so much anxiety, would freak out that she wasnt in the system.  she would immediately call to see what is going on with va eligibility fist
- b - would be confused because she wasn't sure if it was tricare or va eligiiblity.  if it was va eligibility, she'd be on the phone
- c - does like that it adds a reminder to check the information to see if she fat fingered it, but she still wouldnt continue
- d - clarifies that shes not eligible for cva because she's eligible for tricare.  she would likely go forward just to see what happens. is it herself or soemone else (a kid) that wasnt eligible
- e - would continue
- confidence level - only 2 were confident what was going (info not found - she'd stop and call, last one was high confidence), overall 3/5
- the ones that didnt mention what she's not eligible for (va or tricare), not clear what it was taht they couldnt find


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- green checks mean may be eligible, and red check mean not elibile (top two)
- a - may be eligible because she meets 1/3 AND not eligible for tricare
- negative a - meets 1/3, but still doesn't like the red box next to "not eligbile for tricare" - double negative
- b positive - favorite of all
- b negative - more clear, the x is more clear that this is the one qualifier that she doesnt meet
- x is showing the requirement has not been met
- b is the preferred
- 



#### Post-Task Interview
- no other notes, everythign able to be cleared out
- preference for eligibility - wants to be able to check before hand, likes the precheck
- still okay sharing clip
