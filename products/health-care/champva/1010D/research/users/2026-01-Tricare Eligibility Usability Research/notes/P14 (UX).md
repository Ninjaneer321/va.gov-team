#### Introduction
- Okay to record
- okay to share clip
- 

#### Warm-up Questions
- Has not applied
- has heard of the program
- Program is for caregivers or family members of vets who don't have other insurance
- Tricare difference - Tri is provided to retirees and active duty
- not everyone has access to tricare, so that's why theyd look to CVA
- 

#### First Task: [INTRO PAGE] 
- [x] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [ ] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- likes that it's number, that's helpful
- likes the disclaimer at the top about having already applied before (has friends who have applied multiple times)
- would click on eligibility link
- suggested bolding the tricare note so it's more clear tricare benes shouldnt apply
- She likes the live links for supporting docs - she likes a checklist personally of things she'll need
- would read the eligibility form very closely, line by line, before applying
- it's noted a few times about tricare eligibility being a disqualifying factor for cva
- knows she has to fulfill at least one of the relationship qualifiers and not be eligible for tricare after reading rrequirement list
- expectst that if she's indicated that they are eligible for tricare or if you are an ineligible relationship (parent of vet), the form would prevent them from continuing
- because she has tricare, she knows she wouldnt be eligible
- shes not sure if you age out of tricare as a dependent child, would you then be eligible for cva?
- She would look for more additional information before continuing
- 5/5 - pretty informed about what you're going to do 


#### Second Task: [ELIGIBILITY PATTERN] 

- good to call out not applying for a benefit if you aren't eligible as it will delay others
- applying for benefits on behalf of someone else - woudl expect it to be a vso
- "answer to the best of your knowledge" has someone died - how would you not know that?
- answering to the best of ability makes sense for things that are more uncertain -might be helpful to provide more details about total disability
- if she was a family member and didnt know tricare, she would probably save in progress and go do more investigating
- or she'd click "i dont know" and hope that the form is checking
- gives two green chck marks, so indicates she is eligible, assumes red x would indicate she isnt eligible
- feels confident that she's eligible for champva
- if she was really applying, she would continue the application
- ease of understanding 4/5 - it only says "you MAY be eligible" and still included info about not being eligible.  So that was a  bit confusing and may have someone stop applying 



#### Third Task: [INTRO] 
- [ ] Prototype BLUEBERRY
- [x] Prototype PINEAPPLE

- Notes


#### Fourth Task: [ELIGIBILITY] 
- loves the finish application later
- 1/7 may be confusing, is it going through eligibility already (thinks it's just the eligibility check)
- with the alert on vet in deers - it still says "may not", it's not definitive
- would consider still going through the form because it's not definitive 
- would like the link for tricare eligibility info
- if she was confident that she wasnt using tricare, she would keep applying
- she wants to be directed to tricare to get coverage
- the wording on permanent and total is also available on their decision letter for disability - we could include a note to check that determination letter
- P&t was hard to understand at first, so directing to where they can find that information would be helpful
- service connnected - it can be degenerative, so it can get worse
- addign more detailsa round these terms will greatly impact if users select yes or no
- confused by the stepper not advancing again
- likes that this version sends you over to tricare
- she would go check tricare first, using the "finish this app later"
- green check mark is good
- x reads as not eligible because of this reason (eligible for tricare)
- again mentions the soft language "you may not be eligible" vs "you are not eligible"
- she doesnt know wny if you had tricare, why you'd apply for cva
- knows that va benefits are very nuanced
- 3/5 - this one is harder to understand, wrap their head around, because its not definitive
- amount of information - liked that it linked out to deers
- knows there's not alot of dod and va communication, but would be nice to link over to the tricare sign up pages
- would be lovely if these systems could talk to each other so users didnt clog up eligibility or could streamline application process
- could explain it to a friend - make sure you dont have a red x.  if you have a red x and you're not sure she would recommend going to deers to double check
- 



#### Fifth Task: [ALERT MESSAGES] 
- a - laughed a bit at "couldnt find the vet info in system"
- this happens all the time and is why people push through - the VA has the wrong birthdate on their system
- if you go back and double check, everything is correct, but what would you do - this would be frustrating
- she would continue the application in the hope that they would find the discrepency along the way
- she hopes they would check that information along the way
- b - she would complete the application
- c - reads as eligibility tool cant figure it out
- if the info is correct, she would select to continue after the double check if it's all entered correctly
- d - non-definitive language again
- many vets and family members know that it's very nuanced
- she would include the link here again for tricare because that's more helpful than just saying "we found it over here"
- ideal would be that tricare is expecting you - has your information already
- e - would keep going
- 3/5
- 


#### Sixth Task: [SUMMARY CARDS] 
- thinks theres a typo next to the red x - she knows that its the disqualifying factor, but it's misleading
- called out that the sentence is the same with green check and red x
- double negative is throwing her off, she wants sentence to change depending on answer
- wnats link again to tricare if they are not eligible for cva but they are for tricare
- content above bullets, below header, was helpful (style b)
- that sentence was definitive, it's very helpful
- would pick card style b because it's definitive
- anything unclear or confusing - no
- 



#### Post-Task Interview
- any other feedback - color coding is very helpful (yellow caution, green yes, red no)
- visual indicators are helpful for quick indicators
- she would want to go through the eligibility check, but some would see it as a barrier to access if they felt very confident that they were eligibile
- did catch that even if you're not using tricare, but you are eligible for it, then it's still a disqualifier
- that's why it would be so helpful to provide so many links to tricare if they are determined to be eligible
- 

#### Additional Notes**
- still okay with recording and sharing clips
