00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:08.729
Moderator: Alright, I have started recording. I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.610
P2: Yes.

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:22.970
Moderator: All right, and then I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with our VA partner if we remove any information that can be used to identify you.

4
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.860
P2: Yes.

5
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.650
Moderator: Alright, thank you, and that was all for the boilerplates, and now we can get to this.

6
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.660
P2: Okay, cool.

7
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:44.840
Moderator: And then, so, a few warm-up questions for you here. Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program, of the Department of Veteran Affairs, or the CHAMPA program?

8
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.309
P2: I have not.

9
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.449
Moderator: Okay. And then, have you ever heard of the Champa program before?

10
00:00:51.740 --> 00:01:02.429
P2: I feel like I've… I feel like I've heard the name, but I haven't looked into it in detail, so I'm not sure exactly what it entails, or, like, the characteristics of it.

11
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.899
Moderator: I gotcha. And then… Let's see, and then, have you ever heard of TRICARE?

12
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.310
P2: I've heard of TRICARE, yes.

13
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:20.900
Moderator: Okay. I know you don't know, like, what CHAMFA is, but what do you… what would you think the difference between, TRICARE and CHAMPA would be?

14
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.310
P2: I would think… probably, maybe, like, just…

15
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.650
P2: The type of coverage, like, what each of them… I think they're both…

16
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:43.840
P2: like, a type of cost-sharing program, like, similar to your, like, just general health insurance. I think maybe some differences might be…

17
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:52.560
P2: The extent of that coverage, like, what percentage is covered, and then how, obviously, like, how that translates into cost for…

18
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.779
P2: You know, for the user.

19
00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:11.609
Moderator: Okay, thank you for that. And then, for this next part here, I will be sharing a prototype with you, and I just want to confirm a couple of information so I know the correct one to send to you here. You are using your desktop, or is it going to be a mobile device?

20
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.519
P2: Desktop.

21
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.930
Moderator: Desktop, okay. And then you are, like, a spouse or family member? Okay.

22
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.160
Moderator: So let me copy the right link, and then…

23
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.479
Moderator: I will paste it to you in, in the chat here.

24
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.249
Moderator: So, I'd like you to open it in your browser and share your, share your screen in Zoom.

25
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.700
P2: Okay.

26
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:43.319
Moderator: I can kind of help you walk through that if you need. I'll give you a moment to kind of close any other browser or tabs that you may need.

27
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.259
P2: Yeah, let me do that…

28
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.429
Moderator: It takes a little bit of time to, to load the prototype as well.

29
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.650
P2: Yeah, I'm trying to… okay.

30
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.640
P2: Go.

31
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.219
P2: Let me share…

32
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.339
P2: Great, let me know when you can see it.

33
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.410
Moderator: I can see it.

34
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.989
Moderator: Alright, so… For today, on the

35
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:43.269
Moderator: We are gonna take you through, the second prototype, which is that orange-looking one, the prototype pineapple. Go ahead and click into that.

36
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.270
P2: Okay.

37
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:53.769
Moderator: So, on this first page here, please take a few moments or longer to kind of look through the instructions, and then when you're ready, in your own word, tell me what this means to you.

38
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.199
P2: Okay… Chem about benefits…

39
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.420
P2: Okay, so to me, this looks like…

40
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:28.890
P2: pretty much your home page, if you will, or landing page for the Champa, like, benefits application, kind of your…

41
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.849
P2: I mean, it gives you a good bit of information on, you know, like, what steps

42
00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:45.680
P2: to look out for are necessary, and obviously step one would be, you know, checking if you're even eligible for it. You know, gathering your information and starting the actual application process. I…

43
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.439
P2: Two, after you apply, okay…

44
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.520
Moderator: Okay.

45
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.620
P2: Yeah, so definitely kind of your… like I said, your…

46
00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:03.619
P2: landing page or starting point in that, like, CHAMP benefits application process, if you will.

47
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.449
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, who is eligible to apply?

48
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:15.209
P2: Spouses, dependents, survivors of, of veterans or service members.

49
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.800
Moderator: And then, do you see any reason that you might not be eligible?

50
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.770
P2: Oh, if you're… so if you're eligible for TRICARE, you can't,

51
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.579
P2: you wouldn't be eligible for a Champa.

52
00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.819
P2: Though… exactly what details go into that, I'm not sure.

53
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:40.440
Moderator: Okay.

54
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.430
Moderator: And then, if you weren't sure, whether you qualify or…

55
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.740
Moderator: Or whether… where on this page would you look?

56
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:59.939
P2: Right here, so I see the hyperlink of, find out if you're eligible for, CHAMPA benefits. I'm assuming if you go into there, you'll kind of get more information on…

57
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.670
P2: you know, why…

58
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.159
P2: who or who might not, you know, qualify for CHAMPA benefits, it looks like. And again, it looks like if…

59
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.349
P2: kind of one disqualifying item is if you're eligible for TRICARE, you wouldn't be.

60
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.730
Moderator: Okay. And then, is there anything here that makes you uncertain about applying?

61
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:31.219
P2: uncertain? No, I mean, I think it's, like, it's a fairly concise way of giving you an overview as to…

62
00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.559
P2: You know, what the application process would look like.

63
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.890
P2: I see, like.

64
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:49.550
P2: you know, a few kind of examples of documents, and more documents you'll need in that application. I like that it kind of tells you how long, more or less, it might take, and kind of next steps after applying, so may not…

65
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.070
P2: Not, nothing concerning, at least, in my opinion.

66
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.800
Moderator: Okay.

67
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:59.170
Moderator: And then, would you continue, or would you want more information first?

68
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.380
P2: I would probably want information…

69
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:13.089
P2: regarding what exactly the benefits would look like, you know? Like, for somebody that doesn't know.

70
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.349
P2: what JAMPA really entails.

71
00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.720
P2: I would want more information, and to your point… I don't…

72
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:26.140
P2: I don't see anywhere here that actually kind of focuses on what

73
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.700
P2: the Champa benefits are, really. Like, I see… if I look at the hyperlinks, it's just more of, like.

74
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.410
P2: The application process, eligibility, documents… But not really, like…

75
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.249
P2: You know, what are really the benefits?

76
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:42.780
Moderator: I gotcha.

77
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:56.589
Moderator: And then… so, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application that you're about to begin based on this page's content?

78
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.010
P2: I guess, again…

79
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:12.699
P2: if I had all the background of the Champa benefits, and I'm just strictly kind of considering this… the application itself, just focusing on that.

80
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.980
P2: Sorry, the scale was 1 through…

81
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.139
Moderator: 1 to 5. 1 to 5, okay.

82
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:24.360
P2: Yeah, I mean, I would definitely say a 5, like, related to the application process itself, I think.

83
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:31.390
P2: To see… quite a bit of information, like, which I already mentioned, right? Like, the whole process, eligibility.

84
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.530
P2: Next steps, things like that.

85
00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:46.269
Moderator: I gotcha. So, in your mind, if you already did a little research or know about the program, and you hit apply, then it would be 5 out of 5 because of the information is relevant to what you're going for.

86
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.080
P2: Yeah, cause I think, like.

87
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:59.299
P2: you know, maybe not knowing any better as far as, like, where this exact page lives, like, this could just be the page that's specific to the application process. Like, there could be another page that's, like, just

88
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.020
P2: specific to, or focused on, like, the actual CHAMPA benefits, right? Like…

89
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.530
Moderator: Right, I get that. Alright, thank you for that.

90
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:18.039
Moderator: And then… so, in this case, you would proceed on to the application from what you have read so far?

91
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.349
P2: Yeah, yeah, if I had the background, right, yeah.

92
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:28.319
Moderator: Right, okay. Then go ahead and click on that blue alert box, scroll down right there, yeah. Just click on this box.

93
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:45.240
Moderator: And you proceed to the next page. So, since this is a prototype, we pre-fill some of the information that you would normally type in for real. Please go through these, like, next few questions, and remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content.

94
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.210
Moderator: And information here, and then you can click on the continue button when you're ready to proceed to the next page.

95
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:55.729
P2: Okay, so this is eligibility information, Jamfa…

96
00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:03.229
P2: First, we'll ask you a few questions to make sure you're eligible. We'll use the veteran's information and responsibility of the veteran and the applicant's

97
00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:09.800
P2: transfer, you won't need… Table a little bit on CT4… Okay.

98
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.199
P2: Which of the best subscribe to you?

99
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.420
P2: Yes, I'm a veteran at my parents.

100
00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:20.780
P2: Someone else, okay.

101
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:27.110
P2: Veteran's name, date of birth, and identification information.

102
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:40.019
P2: Last name… Cree number… Okay, I mean, so far it's all kind of very… Basic info, if you will.

103
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:47.580
P2: Based on the information, the applicant may not be eligible for child benefits. We found better information in defense of…

104
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.489
P2: The tiers for TRICARE benefits, even if you aren't enrolled.

105
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.589
P2: If you're eligible for TRICARE, okay.

106
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:57.050
Moderator: I'll stop you right there.

107
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:06.159
Moderator: So for this, part here, how do you feel about the way that the application checks your eligibility?

108
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:13.799
P2: I mean, I love it. I think that it's… you know, if I'm not eligible, I'd rather kind of know up front, and not,

109
00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:18.560
P2: However, I'd definitely rather that no upfront, and also just not, kind of, like…

110
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:25.720
P2: waste my time going through a broader, lengthier application if ultimately, at the end, I'm not gonna be…

111
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.380
P2: You know, able to apply for something that was maybe known Earlier on.

112
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.549
Moderator: Okay. And then, did you find this helpful, intrusive, or something else?

113
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:41.990
P2: Oh, helpful. Definitely not intrusive, I like that. It, kind of upfront and… And honest, right away.

114
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:46.060
Moderator: Okay. And then, do you trust that this information is accurate?

115
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:53.339
P2: So that's a good, I guess, good question. I mean, I would… well, I do trust that the information is accurate,

116
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.930
P2: you know, I… I…

117
00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:04.390
P2: there might be a case where, you know, I don't know, it might find the veteran's information in the DEERS system, and…

118
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.129
P2: Yeah, I mean, I don't know. I don't even know where I was going with that, but yes, I…

119
00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.299
P2: I find it to be accurate.

120
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:25.490
Moderator: Okay, and then if you believe this check was wrong, let's say you're the opposite, so in this case, it'd be you're not, or you are eligible, or you're actually not eligible for TRICARE, so that means you qualify for CHAMFA. What would you do?

121
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.660
P2: Right, so if I knew that, and I knew that was the case, then,

122
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:35.820
P2: Well, I would… I would still continue. I think you're still able to continue.

123
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:44.199
P2: And if I see, like, the application is denied, or it doesn't let me move forward, and I feel like, hey, this is just incorrect.

124
00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.520
P2: I would, you know, look for a contact information and reach out.

125
00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.330
P2: Via phone.

126
00:12:50.760 --> 00:13:00.240
Moderator: Okay, thank you for that. And then, does this, feel like the information's helping you understand your option, or is the… or is the system blocking you from applying?

127
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:02.980
P2: No, it says,

128
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:11.889
P2: may… I mean, it says, like, the applicant may not be eligible, but it's not… and I see that the… I mean, I think, presumably, that I could still keep going through, so…

129
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:13.789
P2: It's not blocking me, per se.

130
00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:14.390
Moderator: Okay.

131
00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:15.519
P2: Kind of like a heads up.

132
00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.000
Moderator: Right, that makes sense. And then go ahead and continue.

133
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.490
P2: That's a… oh, okay.

134
00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:37.380
P2: This threw me off, because it still said, like, one of seven, but understanding is just a prototype. The veteran died, we'll ask more questions about those details.

135
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:42.309
P2: Permanently, you're totally disabled from a service-connected disability. Okay, no, makes sense.

136
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:51.390
Moderator: pause you up there. So, for that step up there, so you… you're saying because it's the 1 of 7 that's confusing to you, you'd rather have it, like…

137
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:54.200
Moderator: Show the exact page you're on.

138
00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.530
P2: Yes.

139
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:56.270
Moderator: Okay.

140
00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:58.959
P2: or now, let me see…

141
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.250
P2: I guess this is all part of the first step, though, so I guess maybe…

142
00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:08.400
P2: I thought maybe, like, yeah, each page you're on might be…

143
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:20.639
P2: Like, in this case, like, 307, per se, or whatnot, but maybe this is still part of the first step, so if I think about it that way, then that would make sense, but yeah, a little bit… could be a little bit confusing.

144
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:21.530
Moderator: Okay.

145
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:22.280
P2: Yep.

146
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.560
Moderator: Thank you for that.

147
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.860
P2: T… Okay, Veteran Service Connected Disabilities.

148
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.619
P2: Until he's heard from my service.

149
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.460
P2: like the disability.

150
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:39.890
P2: Okay, and I see that it has… okay, how do we design… how do we define service kind of accessibility?

151
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.809
P2: That we've rated as 100% at disability, and that's not expected to improve. Okay.

152
00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:58.810
P2: Makes sense. Eligibility for Tricer is a veteran.

153
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.340
P2: How to check for TRICARE…

154
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.080
P2: Good reporting on the funds.

155
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.379
P2: Tricer website… so, I mean, I get… so this is…

156
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:20.099
P2: Good, right? Because this is kind of, like, you could double-check that initial…

157
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.950
P2: Pop-up that we were talking about earlier.

158
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:30.150
P2: Right? If you feel like, hey, I think this is incorrect. I mean, and even if you feel like it's incorrect, and somehow you find yourself in…

159
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.280
P2: Being reported in the deer's…

160
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:39.949
P2: system, then maybe that's a different conversation to be had. But at least it's kind of like a second

161
00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:42.750
P2: Check that you have there? That you could do yourself.

162
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.120
Moderator: I gotcha.

163
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:48.570
P2: Based on the internet?

164
00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.900
P2: The applicant may not be eligible. Your responses?

165
00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.660
P2: The veteran is not eligible.

166
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:09.770
P2: I guess this is a little, like…

167
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.530
P2: confusing, I feel like, this box here.

168
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:18.360
P2: Like, based on the veteran's information, the applicants may not be eligible. Your responses. Your responses.

169
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:21.239
P2: I mean, I understand the responses, but…

170
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:23.550
P2: Take the check mark and the X.

171
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:30.589
P2: I don't… fully understand, like, I guess from what point of view.

172
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:36.649
P2: Like, the checkme being that this response It's good, and then…

173
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:48.079
P2: the X is, like, the response that's invalidating, or potentially invalidating your eligibility, but then that response is the veteran is not eligible for TRICARE, which we know

174
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:52.459
P2: would be… would give you eligibility for CHAMPA.

175
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:55.669
P2: So, I guess that's what I'm confused about. Okay.

176
00:16:56.570 --> 00:17:03.380
Moderator: And then, tell me in your own words, let's see if you can reframe this page here, what this whole page means.

177
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.259
Moderator: Like, the whole point of this page.

178
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:12.090
P2: Yeah, I mean, I think this is… this is, like, your eligibility summary, I mean, as it says up there,

179
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.759
P2: This is kind of the THE summary right here, basically telling you…

180
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:23.059
P2: may not be eligible, because these are the, like, the responses, I guess, that are kind of,

181
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.980
P2: Flagged, if you will.

182
00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:30.229
P2: But I guess what's throwing me off is, yeah, those… that check and X.

183
00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:36.630
P2: And then… Yeah, but that's kind of, like, what I gather from the page.

184
00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:43.319
Moderator: Okay, so let me understand you correctly here. If you're eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMFA?

185
00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:46.550
P2: No.

186
00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:53.530
Moderator: Okay, and then… For, can you go back to what you were saying about the icons earlier?

187
00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.090
P2: Yeah, so, like, what's throwing me off is…

188
00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:07.430
P2: I guess the way it's framed, it says, like, you know, the veteran… based on the veteran's information, the applicant may not be eligible, and then it kind of highlights these two responses, which…

189
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.969
P2: I would assume that those are kind of, again, like, the…

190
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:15.930
P2: The… the responses that are kind of, like, sensitive?

191
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:25.699
P2: to… You know, that… To, like, just, you know, designating whether you're eligible or not, and then…

192
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.610
P2: what throws me off is this X, because I don't know if this X means…

193
00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:35.619
P2: good or bad in this case, because, you know, the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

194
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.900
P2: I would have thought that if…

195
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:44.490
P2: that's your response, then that wouldn't… that would be a good thing, right? Like, that you would be…

196
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.900
P2: eligible for CHAMPA.

197
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.569
Moderator: That's… that's throwing you off there.

198
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.110
P2: Yeah, because it almost makes it seem like this is the response that's…

199
00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:56.499
P2: Invalidating your eligibility, if that makes sense?

200
00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.180
Moderator: Yeah.

201
00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:57.570
P2: Yeah.

202
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:03.610
Moderator: And then… so, in your own words, then, what is the system telling you about your eligibility here?

203
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.480
P2: I'm not even sure. I mean, I think it's… it's telling me that I may not be eligible.

204
00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.190
Moderator: I gotcha.

205
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:20.790
P2: But I'm not… but I'm not exactly sure… Why? Or… Or I guess, since…

206
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.569
P2: Since the system basically is telling me, like, hey, you didn't meet.

207
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:29.639
P2: I guess if you look at it that way, hey, you didn't meet this criteria.

208
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:34.029
P2: like, I guess, inherently saying that you are eligible for TRICARE.

209
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:38.460
Moderator: Right. And then, how confident are you in that understanding?

210
00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.159
P2: I don't know, I'm like 50-50.

211
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.740
Moderator: Okay, I gotcha.

212
00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:47.349
Moderator: So what would you do next if you were really applying today?

213
00:19:51.510 --> 00:20:02.389
P2: Well, I would continue the application and just kind of go from there, but but yeah, I would still have some doubt as far as, like, can I even apply for it, or am I even eligible for it?

214
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.190
Moderator: I gotcha.

215
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.370
Moderator: And then, let's see…

216
00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:18.199
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand the screen?

217
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.819
P2: This screen,

218
00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:28.519
P2: it's really these things that are throwing me off, so I would give it, like, a 2 or 3.

219
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:35.809
P2: Definitely not… it's not that it's hard to understand, but it is a little bit of,

220
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.669
P2: a little confusing, I guess, depending on the way you view

221
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:43.039
P2: The view… the way you view those lines, or that box.

222
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:49.449
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, can you give a more concrete number, like 1, 2 versus 3?

223
00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:50.889
P2: At 2.

224
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.949
Moderator: Two? Alright, thank you for that.

225
00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.479
Moderator: Okay, and then go ahead and click on the continue.

226
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:08.409
Moderator: So this brings you back to the start of the prototype menu here, and now we're gonna switch gear and…

227
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:16.240
Moderator: And look through, the second prototype that I had mentioned earlier, and this is where…

228
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.870
Moderator: And this is where not everything,

229
00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:37.220
Moderator: works, and we're really interested, and you're like… sorry. This is a prototype again, and not everything works, so this in… this is another prototype. You're gonna be seeing a lot of the same things, and this, again, we're just seeing your feedback. Go ahead and click on the, prototype blueberry.

230
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:41.510
P2: Okay.

231
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.040
P2: Dr. Champa…

232
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.610
Moderator: And then go ahead and proceed the same way you did before, where,

233
00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.730
Moderator: You're looking through this form, and…

234
00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:52.420
P2: Yeah.

235
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.959
P2: I mean, it seems very familiar to the…

236
00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.750
P2: first prototype I'm trying to, like.

237
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.320
P2: See if I see anything that's different, but…

238
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.110
Moderator: Okay.

239
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:12.410
P2: Gather your information, sign your application… It almost seems, like, completely the same. I could be missing something, obviously, but…

240
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:18.810
Moderator: Okay, yeah, so go ahead and click on the, start your form without signing in, that blue box, yep.

241
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:20.830
P2: And then…

242
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:25.980
Moderator: In this prototype, go ahead and proceed the same as you did before by,

243
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:35.669
Moderator: Kind of go through the, you know, think out loud as you're going through this, and kind of, we want to hear your thoughts, and then click continue when you're ready to go to the next page.

244
00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:41.480
P2: Sure. Okay, so this is just… we'll use the same thing as before.

245
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:46.290
P2: I'm disposed of a… okay, same thing as before.

246
00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.629
P2: Veterans Day and Date of birth identification number…

247
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:58.150
P2: Okay, same… pretty much same… Same so far.

248
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.929
P2: But I see in this one, we didn't have that little…

249
00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:07.310
P2: Box pop up, kind of giving you a heads up that you might not be eligible?

250
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:09.540
P2: Is a veteran there to ask you more questions?

251
00:23:10.370 --> 00:23:18.670
P2: Okay, so, no… Veterans Service Connected Disability… Okay…

252
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.710
P2: Same things.

253
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.180
P2: It's a veteran applicant.

254
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:32.210
P2: Enrolled in TribeQer, editable enrolled in Tribe queer, okay, no.

255
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.390
P2: Okay, yeah, so this goes back to… now I kind of see that…

256
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:47.499
P2: the applicants may be eligible. So, what it was telling us last… in the last, kind of, like, pineapple.

257
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:49.600
Moderator: Prototype, if you will.

258
00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:56.730
P2: Was… was the kind of the latter… Assumption…

259
00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.610
P2: That we made, which was, like.

260
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:10.800
P2: These are the two criterias, and the last one, we kind of… we were okay with the first one, which is the veteran is permanently disabled or… or has died, from a service-connected disability.

261
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.060
P2: But then…

262
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:20.189
P2: I guess we had a responding along the way, and I didn't remember responding that way or seeing it, but I could be completely wrong that the…

263
00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:27.439
P2: like, veteran was eligible for TRICARE, so then that's why we had the X here. In this case, we said no, so that's why…

264
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:29.199
P2: You know, both of them are kind of…

265
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:33.119
P2: Green-lighted, and it does say the applicants may be eligible.

266
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.990
Moderator: Gotcha. So this is a lot clearer to you, in this context.

267
00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.529
P2: Well, the context is the same, it's just kind of now going through both

268
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:50.669
P2: Because, yeah, the context is completely the same, but now understanding the difference between both, and yeah, I can see, kind of, like.

269
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.489
P2: That angle.

270
00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.579
P2: I'll bring about it, yep.

271
00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.050
Moderator: And then, in this case, would you take the same or different action as compared to the other prototype?

272
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.150
P2: Same, just continue through.

273
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:12.449
Moderator: Okay. And then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand the second prototype?

274
00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.630
P2: It's essentially the same prototype,

275
00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:25.750
P2: Yeah, I would give it a 5 in this case, but again, it's because, like, for example, if this would have been the first prototype…

276
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:31.029
P2: Actually, this is easier just because it's easier to understand, you know, you've…

277
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:37.900
P2: You may be eligible. Both of the options are green-lighted, so… Yeah, so 5.

278
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:39.859
Moderator: I gotcha.

279
00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:46.599
Moderator: And then, comparing the two prototypes, which, which you prefer to use?

280
00:25:53.080 --> 00:26:00.859
P2: I guess, what's the difference? I feel like they're both the same, just in one… In one case.

281
00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:11.500
P2: both the same prototype, just the results are different, because in one case, the veteran applicant might be eligible for TRICARE. In the other case.

282
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:16.830
P2: They weren't, like, they weren't included in the DEERS system, so…

283
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:20.880
P2: Yeah, but I feel like the prototype itself is…

284
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.069
P2: It's the same, or maybe I missed something.

285
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:28.079
Moderator: Okay, so you think it's the same thing. I want to note that earlier you actually…

286
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:32.460
Moderator: Caught that you didn't see the… that checkbox thing.

287
00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:34.150
Moderator: That little box thing.

288
00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:43.080
P2: Okay, yeah, that's true, that's… well, I would want… if that's the case, then yes, I would rather use the pineapple, so the previous one.

289
00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:55.349
Moderator: I gotcha. But in your case, the Bose prototype is, at least for your initial take, is the same, but if knowing that you have that checkbox, you want to use the pineapple because of the checkbox.

290
00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:06.399
Moderator: I gotcha. Thank you for that. And then, thinking about everything that you just saw, was there too much, too little, or about the right amount of information?

291
00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:13.599
P2: Oh, just the right amount. I like that, you know, I definitely don't want too much information getting thrown at you. I think that's just…

292
00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.570
P2: Adds the,

293
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:23.729
P2: more confusion to the mix, and but then obviously you just want… you don't want too little information, and then you're also kind of confused.

294
00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:24.380
Moderator: Right.

295
00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.280
Moderator: And then, if you had to explain this to a friend, how…

296
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:33.739
Moderator: How would you feel con- or would you feel confident in doing so?

297
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:35.700
P2: Yes, definitely.

298
00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:42.360
Moderator: Okay, yeah, thank you for that. We can go ahead and click the continue button on the bottom of the screen there.

299
00:27:44.200 --> 00:28:01.549
Moderator: Alright, and then now we have gone through the second prototype, so I want to walk you a few different scenarios and messagings to get your feedback. If you scroll down a little bit from the main menu here, you see the two gray buttons. We'll start with the warning alert, go ahead and click into that.

300
00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:15.980
Moderator: So I'll read you a scenario, and then you'll review the messages, and then kind of state any questions that you may have, or feedback that you can provide. So for, warning alert A here, in this scenario, you've entered…

301
00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:24.699
Moderator: the veteran's information, and you see the following message. Please think out loud on your thought on… around that, and what you think it means to you.

302
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:30.740
P2: Okay, under A, we can't confirm the eligibility of the Oh, he couldn't find…

303
00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:36.399
P2: the veteran's information in our system. If you think it doesn't ever check the information you entered, we can't confirm the veteran.

304
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.700
P2: The object is right now, we can… you can try again, so that continue to complete your allocation.

305
00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:44.950
P2: It's an error, information, or select.

306
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:47.580
P2: Continue to complete your application with Kenka.

307
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.860
P2: That may not be eligible returns.

308
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:07.080
P2: Well, I guess, like… which ones? For that sin, I mean… Sorry.

309
00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:08.399
Moderator: So, am I supposed to…

310
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:12.999
P2: choose any of these, or… because I think these are, I mean, obviously, You know, there's…

311
00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:27.640
P2: there's different scenarios here, right? Right. Like, this one's… they just can't find the applicant. Like, I think A, B, and C, you just can't find the applicant's information in the system. D is like, hey, we found your information.

312
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:33.549
P2: And it looks like you are in the system, so you might not be eligible for CHAMPA benefits, and then, like, E is…

313
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.329
P2: You're, you know, like, we've confirmed the veteran's information.

314
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:42.049
P2: But you're… but it doesn't look like you're in the DEERS system.

315
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.089
P2: So it looks like you might be eligible.

316
00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:45.830
Moderator: Okay, and then can you go…

317
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:46.670
P2: interpret.

318
00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:54.189
Moderator: Can you go back to Alert A and just, kind of your thoughts around what you think it's telling you, essentially?

319
00:29:54.780 --> 00:30:00.450
P2: what I think it's telling me is that… that it…

320
00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:12.740
P2: Yeah, that is… that I couldn't find the veteran's information in our system, just overall. Like, not just in DEERS, but just…

321
00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.309
P2: Like, if you just put somebody that's not a veteran.

322
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.690
Moderator: And.

323
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:22.540
P2: I see, you know, there's no record of that person being a veteran, that's what I think A, B, and C.

324
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.159
Moderator: I gotcha.

325
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:26.620
P2: Oh, yeah, 100%.

326
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:35.950
Moderator: I gotcha. And then in this scenario, in these scenarios, if you were doing it, and you saw this message, would you still… would you still continue on?

327
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:46.540
P2: I mean, if I know the person that I'm… like, yeah, I would still continue, I would think that maybe it's just a kind of, like, system error, and I would still continue with the application.

328
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:50.789
Moderator: Okay, I see. And then can you scroll down to Alert D here?

329
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:59.689
Moderator: So, in this, Alert D, you… you see that the application,

330
00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:07.290
Moderator: basically, they're found in it, and because they're eligible for TRICARE, they may not be eligible for CHAMFA.

331
00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:11.039
Moderator: Would you… in this case, would you proceed as well?

332
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:19.180
P2: If I think… I probably still would, honestly.

333
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:20.480
Moderator: Okay. Yeah.

334
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:24.279
Moderator: And then, is there any additional information you would want to see here?

335
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:30.690
P2: No, not to this extent. I feel like… Or…

336
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:41.370
P2: I would like to see the… kind of the hyperlink to the deers, you know, like, I think in one of the… in one of the flows.

337
00:31:41.810 --> 00:31:46.919
P2: And one of the pages, like, you have that, like, hyperlink for you to verify yourself?

338
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.750
P2: Like, within the Deere's system.

339
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.250
Moderator: Right.

340
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:57.229
P2: I think that would be… Like, good to have here already? Like, for you to double-check on your end?

341
00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:07.109
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, across all 5 alert messages that you just saw, how confident, do you feel that you know what to do?

342
00:32:09.410 --> 00:32:11.139
P2: I mean…

343
00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:22.130
P2: I think 5, if I feel like what I know what to do. I think, like I said, the A, B, and C, I'm, like, not too sure exactly if it means that it just can't find the applicant.

344
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.799
P2: Overall, or just within DEERS itself?

345
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:26.940
Moderator: Okay.

346
00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:31.939
Moderator: And then, so, for the A, B, and C, you would want a little bit more information, then?

347
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.560
P2: Right, yep.

348
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.650
Moderator: Gotcha.

349
00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:42.360
Moderator: And then, so, in general, all 5 of the… all 5 alerts, what rating would you give it?

350
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:49.130
P2: All 5 alerts, A 4, solid 4.

351
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.550
Moderator: Okay, so you're relatively confident in… Yes.

352
00:32:52.890 --> 00:33:01.120
Moderator: And then, were there… I know you mentioned the A, B, and C was unclear. Was there anything else that was confusing and unclear?

353
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.180
P2: No.

354
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:03.220
Moderator: Alright.

355
00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:07.819
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that, and then you can scroll down to the bottom.

356
00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:10.290
Moderator: Go ahead and click on that… that button.

357
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:14.550
Moderator: So, for the final task, we're gonna…

358
00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:26.500
Moderator: I like to see, I like to ask about your feedback on several messages that happens at the end of the eligibility summary here. So go ahead and click on the summary card.

359
00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:47.250
Moderator: So on this screen, you'll find four summary cards. The first two, card style A, are from the prototypes that we just went through, and then, the card… the third and fourth card, or card style B, are alternative designs, so please take a few moments to look at all four before we talk about them.

360
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.359
P2: Copy, it may be eligible.

361
00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:13.010
P2: Your responses met all the eligibility requirements for CHAMPA. Your responses did not meet… yeah, definitely, like, cardstyle would be much better.

362
00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.250
P2: This little line here.

363
00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:25.759
P2: clears up all the confusion. Your responses met all the eligibility requirements for Champa, or your responses didn't meet all the eligibility requirements for Champa.

364
00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:31.590
P2: And you could, you know, you could tell which one didn't, so… Yeah.

365
00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:38.010
Moderator: Okay, and then, can you tell what… oh, what do you think each car is telling you?

366
00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:44.659
P2: So this, like, that basically your response didn't meet this criteria, right?

367
00:34:45.339 --> 00:34:51.309
P2: Or, sorry, that you're… yes, so that this is, like, a…

368
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.879
P2: a… how do you call it?

369
00:35:02.389 --> 00:35:07.399
P2: I'm drawing a blank here, but basically that a factor that is making you ineligible.

370
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:10.780
Moderator: Gotcha. So it's almost like a checklist of some sort.

371
00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.570
P2: Yes.

372
00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:22.259
Moderator: Okay, and then I think you mentioned that the bottom two, so the car style B is the easiest for you to understand, or the easier ones for you to understand?

373
00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:23.050
P2: Right.

374
00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:29.179
Moderator: And then… and then you specifically pointed out that a sentence, is it below the… the title?

375
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:30.959
P2: Yes, making that easier.

376
00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.120
Moderator: I gotcha.

377
00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:40.740
Moderator: And then, was there any part of that card, that was… that felt kind of unclear or confusing?

378
00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:43.630
P2: No, no, not necessarily.

379
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:52.859
Moderator: Okay, I want to say that is it. You can end the screen share here.

380
00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:55.819
Moderator: And then you can exit out of that anytime you like.

381
00:35:56.110 --> 00:36:05.639
Moderator: So, that's the end of the prototype portion, and then we'll just go through, like, a few post-interview questions here, and then I can let you go.

382
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:12.339
Moderator: Is there any other feedback you would like to add about the two prototypes and messages that you saw today?

383
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:17.249
P2: No, I mean, I think we've covered it. I think just, you know, kind of like…

384
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:23.919
P2: the added clarity in some of those, like we just saw, kind of the summary cards, I feel like.

385
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:29.419
P2: It cleans up a little bit of the confusion that we noted throughout the flow.

386
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:36.120
Moderator: I got you. And then, do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

387
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:41.299
P2: I guess, what do you mean by that?

388
00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:44.119
Moderator: So, like, how would you…

389
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:58.949
Moderator: want that information, like, the eligibility to be inserted into a form. Like, this, you… This is just the first portion of the form, and there are, like, many ways to do a form. We're curious, like…

390
00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:04.049
Moderator: For that eligibility information, like, what's the best way for you to understand that?

391
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:06.289
P2: I mean, I think…

392
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:15.660
P2: the best way… I mean, as clear as possible, but, I mean, I like that it's kind of…

393
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.910
P2: brought… Fourth up front.

394
00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:38.010
P2: I mean, I think just… the best way, I don't… it's hard to say, because there's so many different options, but I think kind of, like, the way it's presented now is good. I think just kind of, like, the wording, like we mentioned, right? Just, you know, kind of a little bit of, like, polishing up the wording, just to make sure there's no, like, confusion, whether…

395
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:48.739
P2: You know, they're… The applicant is eligible or not, and, you know, what exactly is causing the ineligibility.

396
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:54.170
Moderator: I gotcha. So you're content with the flow, but you just want some clarity in some of the sentences?

397
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.250
P2: Crike, right, yes.

398
00:37:55.250 --> 00:38:00.339
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then that's it. Do you have any questions for me?

399
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:02.720
P2: None, none on my end.

400
00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:11.870
Moderator: Alright, thank you. And then, I want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we are to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?

401
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:12.930
P2: Yes.

402
00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:28.840
Moderator: And then, just to remind, if we do choose to, we will remove any identifying information that, you know, that could be used to identify you, and we'll only share the video with our VA partners for the purpose of improving VA.gov and the digital experience.

403
00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.330
P2: Okay, yep.

404
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:41.289
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then, like I said, we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is helpful for us to continue to improve the site for

405
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:52.859
Moderator: To make sure that it works for, like, all veterans and their families. And lastly, Preachin will send you, like, a thank you note, a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans and family members that you may know.

406
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:57.930
Moderator: That will give them a, like, a chance to, like, kind of participate in future researches.

407
00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.190
P2: Okay, cool.

408
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:02.099
Moderator: So thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day.

409
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.719
P2: Yeah, thank you for having me, and you as well.

410
00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:06.960
Moderator: Alright.

411
00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.710
P2: Thank you. Bye-bye.
