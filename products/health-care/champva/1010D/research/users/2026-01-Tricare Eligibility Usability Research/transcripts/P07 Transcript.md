00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:09.980
Moderator: So, I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm that… are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.640
P7: Yes.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:21.909
Moderator: All right, and then, are you comfortable? We decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.780
P7: Yes.

5
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.480
Moderator: Alright, thank you, and that's the end of the border plate.

6
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.230
Moderator: So we'll move on to the, some warm-up questions here.

7
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.990
P7: Fun stuff.

8
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.420
Moderator: Exactly.

9
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.999
Moderator: Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program at… of the Department of Veterans Affairs, SHAMFA program, before?

10
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.560
P7: A long time ago, yes.

11
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.260
Moderator: Alright.

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.659
Moderator: And then… Have you ever heard of the CHAMFA program? So, I guess you have heard it.

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.010
P7: Yes, I have.

14
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.140
Moderator: Can you explain to me in your own word what you know about the eligibility of that program?

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:06.919
P7: I know that you or your spouse would have to be 100% disabled to get it.

16
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.969
P7: And I know that it's… It's… Not like typical health insurance.

17
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.399
Moderator: Okay, and then, have you ever heard of TRICARE?

18
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.480
P7: Oh, yeah, I was on that log when my husband was active, yes.

19
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.930
Moderator: Okay, and then can you… do you think you're able to just, explain the difference between Chica and CHAMPA?

20
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:38.419
P7: Okay. Tricare, from my understanding, was active duty, military, their families, their dependents.

21
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:56.880
P7: got TRICARE. I know some people can have TRICARE when they retire, and then there's this whole group that gets to use CHAMPVA. I got some opinions on that whole program, but that CHAMPVA is meant more for veterans and their dependent spouses.

22
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.559
P7: And you have to be, like I said, 100%… I believe 100% in order to,

23
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.649
P7: Get… be eligible for the program.

24
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.220
Moderator: Okay.

25
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.170
Moderator: Thank you for that information.

26
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:22.829
Moderator: So I'm gonna share a link with, with you in our chat of the prototypes, and I'd like you to kind of open up your browser and share your Zoom… your screen in Zoom, essentially, and then I can help you through if you need any help. Alright.

27
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.409
Moderator: And then I just want to confirm that you are using, essentially, a computer, or is it a…

28
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.919
P7: I am… it's a surface? I don't know what that's considered anymore.

29
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.490
Moderator: Okay.

30
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.179
P7: I'm sorry, I have no idea what this weekend. Not an issue.

31
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.709
Moderator: Oh yeah, all these new fancy tools.

32
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.200
Moderator: All right, let me…

33
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.369
P7: Like a computer, it's like a laptop, but it's got a touchscreen, it's kinda cool.

34
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.860
Moderator: Alright. Bye.

35
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.780
P7: Click on that.

36
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.479
Moderator: Yep, go ahead and click on that.

37
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.820
P7: Okay…

38
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.750
Moderator: It probably takes a few minutes to, load it up.

39
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.839
P7: It's doing its… it's doing its thing.

40
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.840
Moderator: Yeah.

41
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.340
P7: There we go. Okay.

42
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.030
P7: I'm going to… It wants me to sign in with Google, shall I do that?

43
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.720
Moderator: it wants…

44
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.940
P7: It says, sign into Figma?

45
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.410
P7: with Google.

46
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.270
Moderator: Oh, interesting. I… you don't have to.

47
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.770
P7: Alright, I'll undo that. Okay, I made that go by.

48
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.970
P7: Now, how do I share my screen?

49
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.869
Moderator: So at the bottom of your screen, there should be a…

50
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.299
Moderator: in tap… in this tablet, there might be a share, like, a green dot.

51
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.310
P7: Oh, whoa, I see it, I see it, okay, wait, it says share?

52
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.420
P7: Come on, can we do that? Okay.

53
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.210
P7: Now, where do you want me to go? The entire screen?

54
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.919
Moderator: You're… you're… yeah, sure.

55
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.879
P7: I don't know.

56
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.909
Moderator: Rainbow tail.

57
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.709
P7: Sorry, now you see my lovely background there. Is that helpful?

58
00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.650
P7: I have, not seen anything yet. It says, started.

59
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.820
Moderator: Screen sharing? Okay. Alright, I see it.

60
00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.030
P7: There you are.

61
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.220
Moderator: I see, yep.

62
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.360
Moderator: Okay, we're good to go.

63
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.870
P7: Fabulous.

64
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:19.519
Moderator: Alright, so for the first task here, I'm gonna ask you to click on that blue button, that, prototype blueberry.

65
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.579
P7: Got it.

66
00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:31.049
Moderator: And then on this first page, please take a minute or so to look over the instructions, and when you're ready, in your own word, tell me what this means to you.

67
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.700
P7: Okay… Whew, I went too far.

68
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.319
P7: Okay, it's pretty basic. It looks to me like it's how… it's the info… it's the instructions on how to apply.

69
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.960
Moderator: Okay. You can look up what…

70
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:05.350
P7: you know, eligi… if you already have benefits, what to do. You could check your eligibility, and then it looks like you can start an application and

71
00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.870
P7: And go from there.

72
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.460
Moderator: Okay, and then… so, who is eligible to apply?

73
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.700
P7: Well, according to this… whoop, let me scroll back up…

74
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.199
P7: Spouses, dependents, or survivors of a veteran or a service member who meet certain requirements.

75
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.339
P7: I guess I could click on the…

76
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.680
P7: Click on it to find out.

77
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:38.209
P7: What those requirements are… And you cannot get CHAMP VA if you're eligible for TRICARE. Okay.

78
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:40.470
Moderator: Alright.

79
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.620
P7: That makes sense.

80
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.690
Moderator: And then, if you weren't sure whether you qualify, where on this page would you look?

81
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:55.529
P7: the little under number 1, the one circle, says check eligibility, I'd click on that link to find out if I was eligible.

82
00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:03.250
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, is there any, is there anything here that makes you uncertain about applying?

83
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.409
P7: No, to me, it seems pretty straightforward.

84
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:08.580
Moderator: Alright, and then.

85
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.790
P7: And, you know, I've been doing this kind of stuff forever.

86
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.869
Moderator: Right, so everything's kind of familiar to you.

87
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:24.569
P7: It's all very familiar to me, it seems very easy to understand, very simple. This is what you need to have, so get all your stuff together, and then do your application, and…

88
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.809
P7: You know, put in… eventually, at some point, upload all this.

89
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.640
P7: information that they need. There's various forms of proof and certificates and whatnot.

90
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:42.090
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, if you were applying, would you continue, or would you want more information first?

91
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.239
P7: I'd probably continue, because at this point.

92
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:53.059
P7: I… personally, I would have researched all this beforehand, and would have just been like, alright, I've got what I need, let's… let's do this.

93
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:59.769
Moderator: Gotcha. So, in your own process, you would be researching this first before even getting to this?

94
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:07.620
P7: say, hey, have you heard of Champion? No, what is it? Then go do a little trying to figure out what it was, and if it was something that I wanted to…

95
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.130
P7: apply for.

96
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:24.120
Moderator: I gotcha, thank you. And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly, and 5 being very ill, how informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

97
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:29.219
P7: I'm… I would say probably about a 5. I'm very confident that

98
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.110
P7: you know, I could do this application, not a problem.

99
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.170
Moderator: Okay.

100
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:44.979
P7: I mean, the biggest thing is collecting all the little pieces of proof you need. That would be the most time-consuming, I think, going around trying to find all your certificates and where they are.

101
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.430
Moderator: Right, so just, you're just very confident of, yep.

102
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.270
Moderator: I gotcha.

103
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:53.800
P7: like it's nothing I haven't done before with other things.

104
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.350
Moderator: That makes sense.

105
00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:01.130
Moderator: And then, go ahead and click on that blue box below, it'll move you forward to the…

106
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.469
P7: The prototype? Yeah. Does sign or create an account box?

107
00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.520
Moderator: This… anywhere in this box, really, it'll move to the next box.

108
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.080
P7: Yep.

109
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:12.930
P7: Okay.

110
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:30.839
Moderator: Alright, so since this is a prototype, we pre-filled all the information that you would normally type in if you were doing this for real. Please go through these next few questions, and then remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts and your, you know, on the content and information here.

111
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.940
Moderator: And then when you're ready, go ahead and click on the continue button.

112
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:40.329
P7: Okay, well, that's… this all, again, is pretty standard,

113
00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:56.419
P7: to be honest, if I was doing this for real, I probably would just hit continue and keep on going and not read it, because it doesn't… to me, it's not anything additional. Like, I already… okay, I get it. You've said it before, it's being reiterated, you have to have eligibility requirements.

114
00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:01.510
P7: You're gonna need veterans information. Okay, so I'm going to hit continue.

115
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.720
Moderator: Okay.

116
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:08.409
P7: Alright, and then, again, This is something I've seen in various forms.

117
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.890
P7: So I'm the spouse, so I'll click that.

118
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.499
P7: I see that. That's all… Say, no, it's pretty straightforward, so that's… that's good.

119
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:28.420
P7: And then… we would add in… The veteran's information, again, Nothing out of the ordinary.

120
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:34.040
P7: You would… typically, you should have that, and it wouldn't be a problem. Continue.

121
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:37.040
P7: Okay.

122
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:42.970
P7: Again, veteran status, straightforward, easy answer. You should be able to do that, no problem.

123
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.810
P7: Permanently and totally disabled.

124
00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:52.169
P7: That should be something you can easily answer, and if you didn't know, click on the little how do we define

125
00:09:52.600 --> 00:10:01.869
P7: button to give you some more information. In my case, my husband is permanently and totally disabled, so I'd keep on going.

126
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.320
P7: Eligible for TRICARE.

127
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:20.310
P7: I know. I'm not eligible for TRICARE, I would say no, but I do like that you can check if you have what your eligibility is, and I like that there's an I don't know, because I'm sure there's people out there who don't understand, like, I don't know what this is.

128
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:29.400
P7: for me or not. I'm gonna hit continue again, because it's, in my case, pretty straightforward. Yay! I'm eligible! Woohoo-hoo!

129
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.710
P7: So… That…

130
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:42.860
P7: That's pretty good. I, you know, that's easy to let you know why you got your eligibility.

131
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.559
P7: There's a way to get out of the application if it says sorry.

132
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.789
P7: So, I'm gonna hit continue, because…

133
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.299
Moderator: Okay, let me pause…

134
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:59.290
P7: Let me pause you right here, I got a couple questions for you. No problem. So, in your own word, tell me what this page means.

135
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:04.409
P7: It means that I'm able to receive CHAMP VA benefits.

136
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:17.960
P7: I was… I'm eligible. It told me that because of my veteran's disability status, or basically the disability status, whether they have passed on or not, that I am

137
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.670
P7: eligible for it, and my veteran or myself are not eligible for TRICARE, so we can get

138
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:28.449
P7: we are eligible to get CHAMP VA, and that now we have to

139
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:31.810
P7: Fill out the rest of the form to…

140
00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.020
P7: I guess, get cards, whatever one would get.

141
00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.500
P7: For this information.

142
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:45.730
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, what do the, kind of, icon and checkmark means to you, so that… the two green checkmark above?

143
00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:49.919
Moderator: What does that mean to you? To me, the green check marks themselves means you're good to go.

144
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.619
Moderator: Hi, guys.

145
00:11:50.620 --> 00:12:04.200
P7: Everything's good, everything's great. You met the two different requirements that they needed for eligibility. If one of them showed up red, or both of them showed up red, well, then there's a problem, and you either would have to go back and fix whatever you

146
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:12.089
P7: You did, that was the problem, or you're not eligible and you need to exit the application and go figure something else out.

147
00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:17.010
Moderator: And then, based on this information, do you think you're eligible for, CHAMPA?

148
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:17.780
P7: Yep.

149
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.860
Moderator: Alright, and then, how confident are you in that understanding?

150
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:34.060
P7: Very, very confident. Like, it's very… to me, it's incredibly straightforward, very easy to see. You get green, green means go, so… and explains why.

151
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.670
P7: You're eligible?

152
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:42.450
P7: I know this is an assumption, but if you were not eligible, I would have to assume that it would tell you why you were not eligible.

153
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.119
P7: So, I think it's very clear

154
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:50.859
P7: And for the average person who's used to dealing with computers, this would be a very easy

155
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.010
P7: Thing touch and grasp.

156
00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:58.560
Moderator: And then, would you… what would you do next if you're really applying today?

157
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.280
P7: I'd hit the continue button.

158
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.880
P7: And keep on going. So, shall I?

159
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:07.010
Moderator: Not just yet. I do have two more co- or one more question here.

160
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:15.340
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it for you to understand the screen?

161
00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:17.790
P7: Very easy. A 5. It was…

162
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:18.820
Moderator: A 5. Alright.

163
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.830
P7: To me, it was incredibly easy.

164
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:23.369
Moderator: And then, why did you give it that rating?

165
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:29.680
P7: It is simple, it is easy to understand, it is very clear.

166
00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:32.379
P7: Very clear to say, okay.

167
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:50.910
P7: I mean, the only other thing that could be added is, in between the gray box and the little title at the top, this is CHAMP VA Benefits Summary, is you are eligible, would be the only thing to make it even more clear, or you are not eligible to, like.

168
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:55.219
P7: Big, bold, green, or red, you know?

169
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.310
Moderator: I gotcha.

170
00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:02.840
P7: That would be the only other thing you could add to make it even more… Simple to understand.

171
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.950
Moderator: I gotcha.

172
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.950
Moderator: Then go ahead and click on the continue button.

173
00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:08.470
P7: Okay, there we go.

174
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:17.850
Moderator: We'll take you back to the beginning of the prototype here, and then for the next task, we'll go into the, pineapple. So, prototype pineapple.

175
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.370
P7: There we are.

176
00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:24.890
Moderator: Now, this again is a prototype, so not everything works, and then…

177
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:33.780
Moderator: For this one, go ahead and, since this is the same page, go ahead and scroll down and click on that blue box again.

178
00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.090
P7: Alright.

179
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:51.010
Moderator: So again, you're gonna proceed very similar of what you did before, where you're gonna proceed through these questions, and then, remember to think out loud as much as possible.

180
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.460
P7: Sure. This is the same…

181
00:14:53.620 --> 00:15:02.709
P7: as the other one, checking your eligibility so you can determine if you can apply for this, if it's worth your time.

182
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:10.950
P7: That there are requirements, you have to submit an application. Okay, I'm going to hit continue unless you have some questions.

183
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.159
Moderator: No, go ahead and continue.

184
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:23.050
P7: Continue. And then again, like I said, very… this is another very simple thing. You're either the spouse or dependent, you're either the veteran, or you're doing this for somebody else.

185
00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:30.050
P7: So I will hit continue. That's pretty… I mean, that's your options, it's pretty easy to understand.

186
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.780
Moderator: Right.

187
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:31.840
P7: Oh, come on.

188
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:37.510
P7: Touch-free don't want to work. And then we have my… my veteran's information.

189
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.620
P7: Again, Simple information.

190
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:50.699
P7: Nothing out of the ordinary. I would hit continue, and it's very clearly labeled that it's for the veteran, not for you.

191
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.650
P7: So…

192
00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.280
Moderator: Gotcha.

193
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.019
P7: And if you're any…

194
00:15:54.650 --> 00:16:01.900
P7: And if you're used to being in the military, you know, that's your sponsor, so all of that language makes complete sense.

195
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:03.270
Moderator: I gotcha.

196
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:05.660
P7: Okay.

197
00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:10.079
P7: Now it's saying that you may not be eligible because someone.

198
00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.050
Moderator: is in Deers.

199
00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:13.530
P7: Okay, thank you.

200
00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.290
Moderator: Let me pause you there to ask you a few questions.

201
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:16.920
P7: Sure.

202
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.540
Moderator: How do you feel about the way that this application checks your eligibility?

203
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:32.259
P7: I think it's… I… I like it. It makes it very easy. I think it makes it easier for you, because immediately that popped up, and hey, wait a minute, there's a problem.

204
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:39.790
P7: So let's go find out what it is, because it could be a glitch, or it could be, like, oh wow, you really are not

205
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.140
P7: eligible.

206
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:41.850
Moderator: Okay.

207
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.529
P7: And you find out immediately, like, you're not gonna have to wait.

208
00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.699
P7: You know, for weeks to get a letter in the mail that tells you something.

209
00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:55.250
Moderator: And then, did this feel helpful, intrusive, or something else?

210
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.009
P7: No, I think it's helpful.

211
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:58.170
Moderator: I like it.

212
00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.320
P7: It makes it easier for me to know what to do to move forward.

213
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.430
Moderator: I gotcha.

214
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.980
Moderator: And then for this, do you trust that this information is accurate?

215
00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:17.309
P7: From my personal situation, it would not be, but I would have to say, you know, I'll say yes.

216
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:20.520
P7: For this particular individual, it might be…

217
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.160
Moderator: Okay.

218
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.419
P7: Applicable for them?

219
00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.000
Moderator: Yeah.

220
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.119
P7: You know…

221
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.680
P7: If I got that, I'd be like, there's a problem. We have not been in that system in, like, 10 years.

222
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.719
Moderator: Gotcha. So for yourself, you're like,

223
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.789
P7: I'm like, someone made a mistake!

224
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:48.119
Moderator: So if you're, you know, applying for this, and then you see this message, what would you do after seeing this message, you know, saying that we found the veteran's information in years?

225
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:57.400
P7: I would… I would probably go talk to my husband and be like, oh, there's a problem, and we need to… I don't know who we call, but we need to find out who to talk to.

226
00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:02.980
P7: Because they… Something isn't right in your records.

227
00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.190
Moderator: I gotcha.

228
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:08.110
P7: That's just for me, that's for our situa- I'm basing it off of my situation.

229
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.900
Moderator: Right.

230
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:14.779
P7: If it… If it was true, then, well, you've got to go figure something else out.

231
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:23.340
Moderator: I gotcha. Well, so if the statement, if this warning box is true, what would you do after seeing it?

232
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:32.200
P7: I would… if it is true, then we would… I would stop trying to get enrolled, because we already have TRICARE.

233
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:37.060
P7: And… we would not need CHAMP VA.

234
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.329
Moderator: I gotcha. So, in your case…

235
00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:41.400
P7: Yeah.

236
00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:45.319
Moderator: If this applies to you, then you would stop the application here, then?

237
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.020
P7: That's what I would do.

238
00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.089
Moderator: Okay, so…

239
00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:59.119
P7: I would stop the application and maybe ask a few questions of whoever's in charge of my TRICARE representative, and ask what was going on, but…

240
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.409
P7: I would just stop it, because there was no point in moving forward.

241
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.690
Moderator: I see. Is there anything…

242
00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.240
P7: energy.

243
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:11.000
Moderator: additional that you want to see here, if that was the case, if you wanted to stop the application, you…

244
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:18.139
P7: The only other thing I would think, maybe if it popped up, is some kind of a…

245
00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:27.110
P7: a link to take you to where you can talk to someone, like, you could get a phone number, or some kind of,

246
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:41.409
P7: I mean, I hate the little chatbots, I really do. I'm not… I'm not liking that, but somewhere you can get ahold of a person to talk to and ask why this came up, and what does this mean, and give the person more information.

247
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.540
Moderator: I see.

248
00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.060
P7: Just, you know, if there's such a way to do that.

249
00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:57.859
Moderator: Now, you mentioned before that if you think that this information is wrong, you want to reach out, like, first it's your spouse to kind of confirm the information, and then someone else, like a representative, to…

250
00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:58.530
P7: Yeah.

251
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.750
Moderator: As Y, alright? Yes.

252
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.600
Moderator: I would think.

253
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.899
P7: In either case, you would need…

254
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:10.189
P7: somehow be able to reach a human being to ask why, a representative to say, hey, what happened?

255
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.590
Moderator: Gotcha.

256
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:20.389
P7: Either it's, okay, it's true, and I misunderstood what this was all about, or it's not true, and somebody needs to fix this so we can enroll, because there's no reason not to.

257
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:21.640
Moderator: I gotcha.

258
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:27.999
Moderator: And so, does this feel like the system's helping you understand your option, or the system is blocking you from applying?

259
00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.590
P7: No, I think it's helping.

260
00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:35.870
P7: It's very clear that, you know, you may not be eligible, so you may not want to move forward.

261
00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.599
P7: Until you figure out what's going on.

262
00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.440
Moderator: I gotcha. Alright, thank you for that, and then you can continue here.

263
00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:44.259
P7: All right.

264
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.800
P7: Okay.

265
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:58.119
P7: Pretty… yes or no? I mean, it's pretty simple. Do you have any questions on this one?

266
00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:58.700
Moderator: No, I don't.

267
00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.610
P7: Alright, I'm gonna… I'm gonna move us forward.

268
00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.030
Moderator: Okay, sounds good.

269
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:11.379
P7: you really can't do much more than that. Same with this one, it's yes or no, either you are or you aren't, so…

270
00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.140
Moderator: Right.

271
00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:14.859
P7: I'll just move on on that one, too.

272
00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:22.860
P7: Again, You are, you aren't, and if you don't know

273
00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:30.200
P7: I don't know what to tell you, so I will move… you know, You should know, that's…

274
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:30.690
Moderator: Right.

275
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:33.660
P7: So I will keep going.

276
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.329
P7: And… see, I like it you get the red X, I thought you would!

277
00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:45.970
P7: Okay.

278
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:50.739
P7: This is what I thought would happen. I'm kind of excited.

279
00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:57.440
Moderator: Alright, alright, so, would you take the same action or a different action compared to the other prototype?

280
00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:02.500
P7: Well, again, I still think there should be…

281
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:15.039
P7: between the title and the little box, that it should say something like, you make it, you know, red, you may not be eligible, or again, green, you may be eligible.

282
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:20.629
P7: I would try to… To find out,

283
00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:30.280
P7: Because you're not eligible for TRICARE, so you should be eligible for this. I would make, again, want to talk to someone and find out what's… what's happening here.

284
00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.030
Moderator: Because…

285
00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:42.110
P7: from what I understand, if you do not get TRICARE, and you are… you meet… your veteran met the different requirements, then you should be good to go. So something…

286
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.900
P7: Something… there's a disconnect there.

287
00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:45.660
Moderator: Okay.

288
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:55.279
Moderator: And then, in your, if you see this message, and then would you still proceed with the application, or would you kind of exit it here?

289
00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:03.550
P7: I would probably exit and again, try to find somebody to speak to, to figure out what was going on, because that's a bit of conflicting information.

290
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:04.830
Moderator: Gotcha.

291
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:15.599
Moderator: And then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very, very hard, and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this second prototype?

292
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:27.460
P7: Again, a 5. To me, it was very easy. They said the only thing I would add is some kind of bold statement telling you eligible or not eligible, but it was not difficult to understand at all.

293
00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:36.510
Moderator: I gotcha, that makes sense. And then, I know there's only a very minor difference between the two prototypes. Is there a preference for which one you would use, prefer to use?

294
00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:43.610
P7: Not… not really. I mean, there were not many… it wasn't such a glaring difference that

295
00:23:43.790 --> 00:23:48.190
P7: I could even tell you what it was. I mean, they're not…

296
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.149
P7: I… yeah, no, no preference. They… they seemed very, very good.

297
00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:52.560
Moderator: Okay.

298
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.259
P7: to me.

299
00:23:53.750 --> 00:24:01.950
Moderator: I gotcha. And then just think about everything that you saw. Was there too much, too little, or about the right amount of information?

300
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:05.979
P7: I think it's the right amount of information. It gives you ju- it gives you enough

301
00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:13.609
P7: So that you can make a decision of whether to move forward, or get more information, or just stop the process altogether.

302
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:20.729
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, if you had to explain this to a friend, do you feel confident in doing so?

303
00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:21.600
P7: Yes.

304
00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.979
P7: I could easily walk someone through this.

305
00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.829
Moderator: Alright, I like that full confidence.

306
00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.500
Moderator: And then go ahead and click on the Continue button on the bottom of the screen here.

307
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.670
P7: Okay…

308
00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:51.180
Moderator: it would take you back to the beginning of the prototype, and then if you scroll down, there is a second portion to the prototype here. There's two… there's two types of buttons. One's a warning alert, and then one is the summary card. We'll start with the warning alerts.

309
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.070
P7: Alright, I'll click on that.

310
00:24:53.330 --> 00:25:00.609
Moderator: And then there's a couple of different scenarios, and then what I want you to do is review the messages, and then kind of have…

311
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:14.460
Moderator: state any question that you may have, or any feedback that you can provide. For example, warning alert A, in this scenario, you enter the veteran's information, and then you see the following message.

312
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:26.200
P7: Okay, that… that would be scary, if you got the… not that it's a bad alert, it's not, but if you put it in, then they can't find them.

313
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:44.400
P7: it could, you know, cause a little bit of panic to set in, like, what do you mean? And then, you know, you go back and you double-check it, and if everything is correct, and you still get that, oof, it definitely needs something, some kind of a link to get to a person to find out what's going on.

314
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.480
Moderator: I gotcha. And then…

315
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:56.289
Moderator: So, what's your thought around what that means? And then, can you explain, essentially, what action you would take on this, on that first.

316
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:56.720
P7: For A?

317
00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.679
Moderator: Yeah, for A.

318
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:03.820
P7: Okay. Well, if I got that, I would go back and make sure that I typed in everything correctly.

319
00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:16.829
P7: And if I did, and did it again, and got this again, I would look for someone to speak to. I would look for some type of a representative to find out

320
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:18.580
P7: what's happening?

321
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:25.099
Moderator: So, in this scenario, would you want to apply for the CHAMP VA benefit despite this warning, or no?

322
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:32.989
P7: I would probably still… I would still try to apply, but I would have to find… get this cleared up before, obviously, I could move forward.

323
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:34.040
Moderator: I gotcha.

324
00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.369
P7: So either way, I'd want to speak to somebody to help me

325
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.539
P7: figure out what was happening so I could move forward.

326
00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:49.379
Moderator: That makes sense. And then for the Alert B, again, you enter the veteran's information, and then you see the alert B,

327
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.219
Moderator: Go ahead and think out loud on your… on your thoughts on that.

328
00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:58.310
P7: I would probably hit continue.

329
00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.040
P7: So I could see what happened next, what I could complete.

330
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:15.680
P7: And then try to find somebody, a representative to speak to, to say, alright, I filled out the application, this is what it was telling me, what do we do next?

331
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:22.809
P7: Everything's ready to go, what can you do? You know, is it something you see on your end that can be fixed so we can move forward?

332
00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:30.739
Moderator: I got you. So, a lot of it is you want clarity on the… on the situation, on what you need… you're at.

333
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.500
P7: Yeah, you, yourself to do.

334
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.440
Moderator: Alright, that makes sense.

335
00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:42.190
Moderator: And then, on the Alert C, same scenario, where you typed in the veteran information, and it disappears.

336
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:51.529
P7: I would do the same thing. Again, I would hit continue, complete the application, and then…

337
00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.299
P7: Try to find somebody.

338
00:27:54.130 --> 00:28:02.939
P7: The biggest thing is making sure that there's access to a representative, a human being, who can look into this and find out what's going on.

339
00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:21.949
P7: Gotcha. Like, even just to tell you, oh, our systems are down now, there's nothing wrong with you, and our, you know, our computers are down, and this is what's happening to everybody. Or, oh, okay, let's confirm the information you put in. Oh, you, you put in the wrong social security number.

340
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.260
P7: Reverse numbers, you typo, whatever.

341
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:26.010
Moderator: Right.

342
00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:32.260
Moderator: So, so… I have a follow-up question for you there, then. If you mentioned the…

343
00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:41.399
Moderator: computer, or the system's down and whatnot. Would it be helpful for you to, like, in that message, to say something similar in that sense?

344
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:48.950
P7: Yes, if for whatever reason their systems were down, if you get a message saying, we can't confirm you because…

345
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.890
P7: Our systems are down, and you need to try again later.

346
00:28:54.210 --> 00:29:09.409
P7: that would be helpful, or if they had a time frame, like, we know this will be fixed within the next 24 hours. Please try again tomorrow. You know, that, I think, would be extremely helpful, because then the person's not worried.

347
00:29:09.780 --> 00:29:14.849
P7: It's not me, it's you. Right. You know, it's… I didn't do anything wrong.

348
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.589
P7: It's on their end?

349
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:23.720
Moderator: I gotcha. And then go ahead and go to the alert D. Again, same scenario, you enter the information.

350
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:26.970
Moderator: The veteran's information, and you see that alert.

351
00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:28.810
P7: Okay.

352
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:38.629
P7: Much like before, I… I would see that, and I would… I would stop the application, because it clearly says,

353
00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.950
P7: For whatever reason.

354
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:53.969
P7: you know, whether you're eligible… you're not eligible because you're found in the system, I would then again want to find a representative to speak to to find out, I should no longer be in this system, because

355
00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:58.280
P7: We… we are… we're… for whatever reason, we're no longer…

356
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:13.020
P7: in DEERS, so we should not be in the system and have that get straightened out. Or I am in it, and we have benefits, and I… this is not available to me at that time.

357
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.430
Moderator: I gotcha. Thank you for that.

358
00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.679
Moderator: And then, finally, for the last one…

359
00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.085
P7: E.

360
00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:20.160
Moderator: E.

361
00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:31.149
P7: I like… it's straightforward. Hit continue, and keep on going. You don't need to speak to anybody, you don't need to… just keep on going.

362
00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:43.949
Moderator: Alright, that makes sense. And then, so, across all the messages that you saw, how confident do you feel that you know what to do next, with 1 being not very confident, and 5 being very confident?

363
00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:49.369
P7: Oh, definitely a 5. Incredibly confident on how I would proceed on each of the different scenarios.

364
00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:54.560
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, was there any alert that was confusing or unclear to you?

365
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.609
P7: No, no, the only thing…

366
00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:10.009
P7: This is very, very… very simple, is the little, orange stripe at the end. Like, for Alert E, it's green, you can go. For Alert D,

367
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:18.629
P7: instead of an orange stripe, I'd say make it red, just because it stands out, and people know, -oh, when they see red, they know there's a problem.

368
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:20.120
Moderator: I gotcha.

369
00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:31.569
P7: That, like I said, it's very… it's such a minor thing. But people do associate red with go, and green with stop, and yellow with, hey, wait a minute, there might be a problem.

370
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.140
P7: That makes sense. Speaking of driving, you know.

371
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.180
Moderator: Yeah.

372
00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.710
Moderator: I'll go ahead and scroll down to the bottom, and… so that it leads you back to Prototype.

373
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:42.520
P7: Got it.

374
00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:53.780
Moderator: So, for the final task, I'm gonna ask your feedback on several different messages on what happened at the end of the scenario. Go ahead and click on that summary card.

375
00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:55.230
P7: You got it?

376
00:31:55.370 --> 00:32:11.499
Moderator: On this screen, you'll find four different summary cards. The first two, Card Style A, are from the prototype we just went through, and then the third and fourth, cardstyle B, are alternative design. Please take a few moments to kind of look at all four before we talk about them.

377
00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:31.760
P7: Huh? Okay.

378
00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.450
P7: Now I understand. Now…

379
00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:48.500
P7: Okay.

380
00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.339
Moderator: Sounds like you have an aha moment here.

381
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.680
P7: I do, I do, and, and I… I…

382
00:32:56.170 --> 00:33:02.640
P7: On cardstyle A, I like the one on the left with the green checks. The red X makes me think there's something wrong.

383
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.580
Moderator: Okay.

384
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.419
P7: me to see it, and like, wait, wait a minute, but I'm not eligible, why, why, you know…

385
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.289
P7: the ex kind of… I mean, I understand it.

386
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.450
P7: I see you may not be out, like…

387
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:20.070
P7: Okay, let me see how I can explain this. It needs to be…

388
00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.210
P7: Like… like I said, something really…

389
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.880
P7: Bold, like, you may not be eligible.

390
00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:36.100
P7: And I don't understand… okay, if you're not eligible for TRICARE, then you should be okay.

391
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:43.609
P7: Because it says… I'm… that's what's holding me up, that's what's tripping me up, and I'm sorry.

392
00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:50.249
Moderator: Okay. No, no, that's why we're doing this. So you're saying the wording of it's kind of awkward to you, it's not… it shouldn't be…

393
00:33:50.250 --> 00:34:09.620
P7: the veteran applicant is not eligible for TRICARE? Well, you cannot be eligible for TRICARE and get CHAMP VA. You can't have both. So that's what kind of, like, okay, should that say the veteran applicant is eligible for TRICARE, and that's why you're not getting

394
00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:14.589
P7: you're not considered eligible for CHAMP VA, or…

395
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:19.790
P7: That… yes, that's tripping me up, and I'm sorry.

396
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:22.049
Moderator: No, don't be sorry for that.

397
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:29.350
P7: I may not be reading it correctly, but that's what my brain is like, hey, wait a minute, that does not make sense to me.

398
00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:33.510
Moderator: I gotcha. So it's like that devil negative that's throwing you off here.

399
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:40.749
P7: Yeah, because it's saying you may not be eligible, and then you're reading all the paper, or whatever, the paper… we'll call it paperwork, and it says…

400
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.220
P7: You cannot be on TRICARE,

401
00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:50.660
P7: You cannot be on TRICARE and CHAMP VA, but I'm not eligible for it, so why can't I get my CHAMP VA?

402
00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:51.889
P7: Stop.

403
00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:53.389
Moderator: I gotcha.

404
00:34:53.559 --> 00:34:54.449
P7: Yes.

405
00:34:55.230 --> 00:35:00.239
Moderator: And then, can… what do you think each car is telling you, essentially?

406
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:07.090
P7: Each… all four of them are telling you whether you can… you should proceed, with your application, because…

407
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.719
P7: It's all good, and you can keep going, or…

408
00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:21.429
P7: You probably should stop your application and figure out what happened and what… where the problem is, so then you can either move forward or just…

409
00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.050
P7: Stop altogether.

410
00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.849
Moderator: Alright, and then…

411
00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:31.279
Moderator: Can you, are you able to see the difference between the two cards here? Or the two sets here?

412
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.500
P7: Yes, I like… see? See, that's what's tell… the very… Yeah, Card B.

413
00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.800
P7: Card B, with the little red X, that makes sense to me.

414
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:44.019
P7: Your veteran or applicant is eligible, so therefore.

415
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:51.250
P7: you're not. I gotcha. And that, that, that's… yeah, see, that does not trip me up. That's not…

416
00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:54.820
P7: Playing with my… Messing with my brain.

417
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:59.069
P7: So, that makes a lot more sense to me, would be B.

418
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:09.740
Moderator: And then, I do want to draw your attention to the content above the bullet point of each card. There's a slight difference between.

419
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:17.289
P7: Alright, I will admit I may not be able to see it, but… here we go, okay.

420
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.940
P7: What's the difference?

421
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:35.740
Moderator: So, I'm gonna draw your attention to the content just above the bullet point, or the kind of icon for each card.

422
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.209
P7: Where are my responses?

423
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.799
P7: Oh, I see that! No, I like that. Your responses?

424
00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.529
P7: I like that.

425
00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:50.539
Moderator: And then… and then on the card style B, slightly different here.

426
00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:57.240
P7: If… if there's… now I see it. Okay, if there's…

427
00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:03.680
P7: Alright.

428
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:07.150
P7: And B, That's…

429
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:13.970
P7: you know, I like… I like the statement. Your responses met all the eligibility, but it needs to be…

430
00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:19.090
P7: bolder, so that they can see it. Or a different color?

431
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:27.670
P7: like, bold in a different color, so you realize, okay, I met all the eligibility requirements, and then the other one says.

432
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:34.120
P7: again, bold in a different color, you didn't meet it, so it stands out, because my eye just went right…

433
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:36.859
P7: Pass that to the… to the check marks.

434
00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:37.880
Moderator: I gotcha.

435
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.020
P7: RDX.

436
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:47.750
Moderator: And then I… so, which… now, knowing that all you know now, which set is the easiest to understand at that glance?

437
00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:48.690
P7: B.

438
00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.610
P7: Still big.

439
00:37:50.790 --> 00:38:01.969
Moderator: It's a stupid X and A that drove in the wording that got me. Could you clarify what makes it clearer than the, so you're saying it's the icon itself?

440
00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:17.039
P7: It makes sense when you look at the card on the right that says you're not eligible, and it has the red X, and the wording is correct, saying that you're not eligible because you also are eligible for TRICARE.

441
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:21.730
P7: that… That's what tripped me up up top.

442
00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.760
Moderator: So the content and the icon basically matches.

443
00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:36.770
P7: Use of icons, yes. And your responses met all the… it made it very clear that your response… your response met… the eligibility or response did not meet it.

444
00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:43.699
P7: It's… it's much… it's very, very clear to understand you're a go, or you're a no.

445
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.340
Moderator: I gotcha. And then,

446
00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:52.840
Moderator: Was there any other part of the card that was unclear or confusing to you?

447
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:57.770
P7: Not… not anything that I… I haven't already said. It…

448
00:38:58.020 --> 00:38:58.890
Moderator: Alright.

449
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.430
P7: Other than that, it's fine.

450
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:12.240
Moderator: That makes sense. And then go ahead and end, screen share here. We're done with the prototype portion. I have a couple of post, kind of additional questions for you.

451
00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:14.029
P7: Okay, so you stop screen sharing?

452
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.809
Moderator: Yeah, you can still.

453
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:15.250
P7: Alright.

454
00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:15.920
Moderator: Okay.

455
00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.340
P7: There we go.

456
00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:24.799
Moderator: All right, is there any other feedback you'd like to add, about the two prototypes and messages you saw today?

457
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:33.679
P7: Not that I can think of, other than I'm really happy that they're moving to an online registration system.

458
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:53.119
P7: Because the… when I applied many, many years ago, we got denied. It was paper, you had to fill it out, you had to mail it in, and then you had to wait forever and a day to get your letter back. So being able to do this online on your phone, on a computer, on a laptop, on whatever.

459
00:39:53.370 --> 00:40:05.700
P7: makes it so much easier. I see. And I like that it had… where you could stop your applications, like, if you're in the middle of something and then you have to be taken away, you could stop it and come back to it at a later point.

460
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.290
P7: And… and you're, you're good to go.

461
00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:11.939
Moderator: I gotcha. And then you did mention… Go ahead.

462
00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:17.320
P7: immediate feedback. You get immediate feedback. You're not waiting weeks.

463
00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:25.270
Moderator: Alright, and then, it sounded like you tried to kind of apply for it, but got denied in the past, is that correct?

464
00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:28.400
Moderator: You are not enrolled in a…

465
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.809
P7: No, I never did it again. I got you.

466
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:32.070
Moderator: Alright.

467
00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.140
Moderator: I see.

468
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:41.880
Moderator: And then, so… This is, like, a… not a hypothetical… I guess it is a hypothetical question.

469
00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:48.619
Moderator: Do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

470
00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:52.790
P7: And what do you mean?

471
00:40:52.960 --> 00:41:01.540
Moderator: So, like, the questions that you just went through, is there a different way that you want to present those type of questions?

472
00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.860
P7: No, no, I thought, again, it's very straightforward, very easy to understand.

473
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:18.659
P7: Minor tweaks, so just making some things a little more bold so it stands up for people, but other than that, I think it makes it really easy to know what to do.

474
00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.760
Moderator: Gotcha.

475
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:28.700
Moderator: And then I don't see any other questions for you from our observers, and I am curious if you have any questions for me.

476
00:41:29.970 --> 00:41:34.999
P7: No, I don't, but yay, I'm really excited that they're doing this!

477
00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.260
Moderator: Thank you.

478
00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:39.140
P7: Like, yay, welcome to the 21st century!

479
00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:40.940
P7: Finally!

480
00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:48.879
P7: Now if you guys could just fix the actual program itself, and make it easier to handle…

481
00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.200
Moderator: Oh, can you elaborate on that?

482
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:57.909
P7: Of course! Like I said, I am not a member. I did not join years and years ago. We're talking, like.

483
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:10.599
P7: I don't know, 12 years ago? We… it was before my husband was 100% total and permanent. Someone told us to apply. It was such a horrible process. We got denied, never tried again.

484
00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.989
P7: I have joined forums on social media, Facebook.

485
00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:20.580
P7: learning about this, because I'm like, well, I just want to know more. And it just…

486
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:39.530
P7: You don't know where or what doctors take this program. You don't have a clear under… doctors don't have a clear understanding of how to bill this program, so there's a lot of billing issues, there's a lot of confusingness with TRICARE, and people getting really, like, large bills sent to them, and it sounds like a hassle to…

487
00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:54.560
P7: to, contact anyone, to get any information. It's a hassle. Once you fill out your application, we're talking, I believe it was at some point, it might be longer now, like 6 to 8 months before you were even enrolled.

488
00:42:55.080 --> 00:43:08.830
P7: Which is insane. Like, it's gonna take 6 to 8 months before you're enrolled, so you then have to wait 6 to 8 months to get any kind of medical care that you're not paying out of pocket for. From what I gather, and from what I have… I've read.

489
00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:17.649
P7: it's not a program that's easy. You have to be very on top of it, and you have to, like, be on top of your doctors, and be on top of the billing, and be on top of…

490
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:24.879
P7: you know, the CHAMP VA end of it, to make sure that everybody is doing what they're supposed to be doing. It's not clear

491
00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:30.880
P7: What's… approved? Like, what you can get done, what… I guess, like, in…

492
00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:41.429
P7: you know, is that surgery covered? Is this procedure covered? Like, coverages aren't easily understood. What doctors accept this aren't easily understood? What…

493
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:54.190
P7: all of that, how this all works, what you have to pay, what you don't pay, your doctor screws it up, and then… how do you get it all fixed? It just… there's a lot of miscommunication, from what I gather.

494
00:43:54.220 --> 00:44:06.820
P7: And so seeing all of that, and hearing all that, and reading that online, I said, nope, I'm not going to even bother to sign up, because this sounds like it's not even worth the aggravation.

495
00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.470
Moderator: program itself.

496
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:11.550
P7: I'll tweak my… yeah, I'll take my chances and see what happens.

497
00:44:11.550 --> 00:44:21.220
Moderator: Alright, and then based on what you saw today, just the eligibility portion of it, do you think that was helpful to understand that portion, at least?

498
00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:32.450
P7: Yes, no, I think it was very helpful, and that had… had I seen… if that is how it is to register, I might consider it in the future at some point, because it would be easy, and you just have it, and…

499
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.020
P7: you know, keep it in your back pocket for emergencies. Right, right.

500
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:43.489
Moderator: That makes sense. All right, and then I want to say thank you for that additional feedback.

501
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:44.840
P7: You're welcome.

502
00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:52.780
Moderator: I am gonna circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we decide to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.

503
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.970
P7: Sure!

504
00:44:54.360 --> 00:45:08.949
Moderator: And then, just to remind you, we do remove any information that could be used to identify you, and then we're, and then we only share this with our VA partners for the purpose of improving the VA.gov and other digital experiences.

505
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.460
P7: Sure, and then.

506
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.620
Moderator: So…

507
00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:30.259
Moderator: We appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback's gonna be super helpful for us to kind of continue working on the site and making sure it works for veterans and their family. And then lastly, Pregen will send you, like, a thank you note with a blurb.

508
00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:40.009
Moderator: That you can pass along to other veterans or their family members that you may know for a chance to participate in future studies. Thank you again, enjoy the rest of your day.

509
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:42.330
P7: Oh, thanks, you too! You guys have a great day.

510
00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:43.809
Moderator: Alright, enjoy!

511
00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.240
P7: Alright, bye!
