00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.220
Moderator: Alright, I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.030
P12: Yes, I am comfortable.

3
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:21.030
Moderator: And then, are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that could be used to identify you?

4
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.780
P12: Yes, I'm comfortable.

5
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.730
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that.

6
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.710
Moderator: So we'll get started on the, interview.

7
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:36.910
Moderator: Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the CHAMPA program?

8
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.870
P12: Nope.

9
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.089
Moderator: Alright, have you ever heard of Champa program before?

10
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.270
P12: Yes.

11
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.060
Moderator: Can you explain in your own word what you know about the eligibility of that program?

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.899
P12: I know the eligibility is for, veterans, is for family members of veterans, that have,

13
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.920
P12: healthcare if there's… if they're not eligible for, TRICARE.

14
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.309
Moderator: Okay, so you have heard of TRICARE as well, then?

15
00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.319
P12: Yeah.

16
00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.109
Moderator: And then, can you explain the difference between TriKit and Champla?

17
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.519
P12: Ugh, it's essentially, CHAMPA, from what I understand, is…

18
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:25.260
P12: kind of like an HMO, so, like, you kind of pay for it out of pocket, so it's like another equivalent healthcare plan, while TRICARE.

19
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:45.079
P12: You pay for it, but it's… it's not… you have the option between military and you use, you know, while Champa's, like, completely civilian, TRICARE is a mixed quasi of, you know, VA and, is, you know, civilian as needed.

20
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.109
P12: I gotcha. Alright, thank you for that.

21
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:57.100
Moderator: So, I am gonna share a link with you in the chat of the prototype, and then I would like you to open up that link and then share your,

22
00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.870
Moderator: do a screen share of your Zoom when you get the chance. And I want to confirm that you are on a desktop or a laptop today?

23
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.899
P12: Oh, yeah, I'm on my tablet, it works.

24
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.540
Moderator: Okay.

25
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.140
Moderator: So let me get that link ready for you.

26
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.670
Moderator: And I have pasted it in the chat window here.

27
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.350
Moderator: Let me know If you need assistance in this.

28
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.909
Moderator: It takes, A little bit of time to load everything.

29
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.389
P12: Thank you so much for holding the world for me.

30
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.860
P12: There you go.

31
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.120
P12: I know.

32
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.400
Moderator: Alright, I see it.

33
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.180
Moderator: And then if you can, there is a pop-up on your,

34
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.900
Moderator: screen there, if you can press the X so that it closes out that pop-up, gives you a little bit more surface area to work with.

35
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.080
Moderator: Alright, great.

36
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.369
Moderator: Alright, Tov,

37
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.130
Moderator: What we'll do is, for our first task, I'd like you to click on that orange button, the prototype pineapple.

38
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.079
Moderator: Alright, on this first page, please take a minute or so to go over the instruction, and then when you're ready, in your own word, tell me what this means to you.

39
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:42.910
P12: Alright, so basically, it says, asking if you apply for CHAMPO, so it's the,

40
00:03:43.950 --> 00:04:00.240
P12: It's basically the landing page to apply for TAMPO, and it breaks it down easy. First, you can check whether you're available, then your availability, which will open a new tab and tell you, hey, you know, this is what you're eligible for, and this is what you'll need, and then it goes through what you need.

41
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:13.019
P12: And then you, go through the application, and then they will, get back to you. And then… but down here at the bottom, which you're gonna ask me what's improvement, it should start this.

42
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.220
P12: Oh, blue box?

43
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.860
P12: Should start at the top.

44
00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.359
P12: Because you gotta sign in first anyways, so you should sign in, and then, oh, you're eligible, blah blah blah blah blah.

45
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.370
Moderator: Gotcha. I think you have… Can you press on that back to the previous page up there?

46
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.940
Moderator: Yep. Yeah.

47
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.029
Moderator: So we stay on this for a couple of questions here. So, who is eligible to apply for CHAMPA here?

48
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.139
P12: Well, who's eligible to apply is yourself,

49
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:59.980
P12: But then you would have to click on this to figure out if your family members, because it doesn't really tell you who's available to apply, it just says if you are…

50
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:10.549
P12: And anyone you're applying for, or your sponsor, but I don't know who I'm applying for. I mean, I know who you're applying for, but, you know, I'm just gonna be devil's advocate.

51
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.289
Moderator: Right. And then, do you see any reason you might not be eligible?

52
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.799
P12: For me, no.

53
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.520
P12: But,

54
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.489
P12: Spouse, dependent, or survivor, it does say at the top, who meets certain requirements.

55
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.010
P12: So,

56
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.839
P12: I don't know why I wouldn't be eligible, but, you know, I'd have to go and click on the hyperlink to find out if I'm available for these benefits.

57
00:05:44.530 --> 00:06:01.809
Moderator: Gotcha. And then I wanted to draw your attention to step one there, where it says on that middle… on that center line, that, it says, we'll also help you check your eligibility when you complete this form. What is your expectation, if any, when you read this sentence?

58
00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.200
P12: that, did you check your eligibility?

59
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.749
P12: So, yeah, I just, expect it to take me…

60
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.450
P12: To a page that lists who's eligible.

61
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.020
P12: And, you know, what are the qualifications?

62
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.250
Moderator: Okay, and then is there anything here that makes you, like, uncertain about applying?

63
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:26.790
P12: Nope.

64
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:34.009
Moderator: Alright, and then if you wanted to, apply today, would you continue, or would you want more information first?

65
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.080
P12: I would probably take more information first.

66
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:39.210
Moderator: And then, why is that?

67
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:53.309
P12: Probably because I wouldn't have everything that I needed to, you know, right now to apply, because when I scroll down, I would need all these things.

68
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.469
P12: So that's why I probably wouldn't end up applying today, because…

69
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.820
P12: I more than likely would have to gather the stuff.

70
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:15.829
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly, and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about this application you're about to begin, based on this page's content?

71
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.710
P12: I feel that I… I'm able to get enough information.

72
00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.500
Moderator: In a rating system, so 1 being very poor, and then 5 being very well.

73
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.310
P12: Poor.

74
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:37.520
Moderator: 4? Okay. So you feel that you have most of the information, and then what would make it a 5 in your opinion?

75
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:50.980
P12: I guess not having to… you know, you have the bulleted down here of what you need, so I think you should have some bullets.

76
00:07:52.010 --> 00:08:03.619
P12: For qualifying, you know, you have bullets for gathering your information, what information that you need, but you don't have bullets for… which, I don't know why.

77
00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.389
Moderator: You can click on the top there to go back, yeah.

78
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.200
Moderator: Alright, and then…

79
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.640
P12: If that's the case, we can go ahead and continue here, so if you scroll down to the bottom…

80
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:20.669
Moderator: In that… the blue box at the bottom, and then choose to start the form without signing in.

81
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.569
P12: So this one? Oh, here.

82
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.070
Moderator: Yeah, right there.

83
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:33.030
Moderator: So for this one, this is a prototype, we… so we pre-fill all the information, that you would normally type in if you're doing this for real.

84
00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:45.109
Moderator: Please go through the next few questions, and remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here, and then you can click continue when you're ready to proceed to the next page.

85
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:50.180
P12: Alright, that's pretty self-explanatory, I don't need my D214.

86
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:54.489
P12: And it's saying I must meet all the eligibility requirements.

87
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.569
P12: So, that's pretty, pretty self-explanatory.

88
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.369
P12: Here, I'm applying for everybody.

89
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.420
P12: You know, not just on… you know, I'm not on somebody else, or…

90
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:14.449
P12: you know, yourself, but I'm giving my whole family, and everyone that I think is qualified.

91
00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:22.539
P12: This is just my name and contact information, so that's pretty self-explanatory.

92
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:33.060
P12: And now it's gonna verify, and now it's telling me I may not be apply, applicable?

93
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.710
Moderator: There?

94
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.530
Moderator: How do you feel about the way this application checks your eligibility?

95
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.639
P12: If it's looking for my gear, does that make sense.

96
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:45.510
Moderator: Okay.

97
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.569
P12: My deer's number, but…

98
00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:04.559
P12: So… It's… and then it's giving you an option, saying… so it's saying.

99
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.520
P12: You found… you found a deer's number, so…

100
00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.109
P12: you are eligible for CHAMP if you're eligible for TRICARE.

101
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:19.549
P12: So, it's just, you know, you know, it's stopping me from wasting my time, pretty much.

102
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.669
Moderator: Okay. And then, does it feel healthful, intrusive, or something else?

103
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:29.060
P12: It's awful, I mean, it's good to know.

104
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.299
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, do you trust that this information is accurate, if you were to see this?

105
00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:36.830
P12: Yeah.

106
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.630
Moderator: Alright, and then what would you do after seeing this message?

107
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.939
P12: Oh, stop it.

108
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.810
Moderator: you stop. Is there anything else that you want to see here?

109
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:53.510
Moderator: When you see this message? Alright, no. Alright. And then, if you believe this check was wrong.

110
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:58.180
Moderator: that you're actually not eligible for TRICARE, what would you do?

111
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:05.890
P12: I would look for a contact,

112
00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:15.869
P12: Information, whether that's, you know, whether that's a form of an email, a chat, or a telephone number.

113
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:25.640
Moderator: I gotcha. So, some kind of contact information. And then, would you continue with the application, or would you stop there and just seek the contact right away?

114
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.689
P12: I'd seek contact right away.

115
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:36.250
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, does this system feel like it's helping you understand your option, or is this the system blocking you from apply… from applying?

116
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:40.029
P12: No, it feels like it's helping me.

117
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.040
Moderator: Okay, thank you for that. Okay, you can continue.

118
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.330
P12: Alright, one moment.

119
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:47.140
Moderator: Should I think.

120
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.820
Moderator: Oh my god.

121
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.270
P12: If you're… Alright, continue.

122
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:06.380
P12: Permal disabled, yes, it's an easy…

123
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:19.250
P12: So, just ask me if I know if I'm eligible, but it doesn't give me the option for some reason if I didn't know.

124
00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.540
P12: The recording?

125
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.070
P12: 40…

126
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:34.890
P12: So, because I'm permanently disabled,

127
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:39.510
P12: I may not be eligible.

128
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.110
P12: So that's 3 different…

129
00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.839
Moderator: Okay, so in your own word, tell me what this page means.

130
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.929
P12: It's confusing, because if I'm disabled.

131
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:57.250
P12: then I should be eligible for TRICARE, so I don't understand why it would be telling me that I'm not eligible for TRICARE.

132
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.970
Moderator: Okay, so that's a little bit confusing to you there.

133
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:04.209
P12: And then if I'm not eligible for TRICARE, then I should be eligible for CHAMPA.

134
00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.110
Moderator: Gotcha.

135
00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:16.029
Moderator: And then, just to make sure I understood you correctly, if you're eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMFA?

136
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:32.729
P12: I don't think you can, because I think that's the whole thing. If you're not… if you're eligible for TRICARE, then you use TRICARE. If you're eligible for… and then CHAMP… CHAMP VA is for, those who are not eligible for… or at least that's what I believe. I mean, I may be wrong.

137
00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.310
Moderator: Okay. And then, what does the icon or checkmark mean to you in this?

138
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:43.720
P12: The check mark means that

139
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:53.450
P12: I am eligible for TRICARE, since I'm permanently disabled. So, saying that I'm disabled, I have a permanent totaled disability.

140
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:54.440
P12: Okay.

141
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.950
Moderator: And then, what is the system telling you about your eligibility here?

142
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.950
P12: It's telling me that I'm not eligible for TRICARE. And not only that, it's telling me I'm not…

143
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.040
P12: eligible for, Champ VA, either.

144
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.730
Moderator: Okay, and then what makes you say that?

145
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:24.089
P12: Because based on the information, the applicant may not be eligible, and on the top here, it's saying, your CHAMP VA benefits eligibility summary.

146
00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:27.919
Moderator: Then, how confident are you in that understanding?

147
00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.720
P12: 95?

148
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:37.289
Moderator: 95, alright. And then, what would you do next if you were really applying today?

149
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:49.299
P12: Again, I would just, I would edit the application and see what was going on.

150
00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.369
Moderator: I gotcha.

151
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.879
P12: And I would call if I truly believed I was supposed to be getting it.

152
00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:00.929
Moderator: Gotcha. So if you think that the information here is wrong, then you try to contact

153
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:04.509
Moderator: either the VA or someone. Does that sound correct?

154
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.400
P12: Yep.

155
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:14.799
Moderator: Alright? And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this screen?

156
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.389
P12: 5?

157
00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:25.160
Moderator: 5, so it's very easy to understand the screen. And then why would… why did you give it that rating?

158
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:32.680
P12: Yeah. Because everything's dropped. Well…

159
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:35.299
P12: No, I take that back. I wouldn't…

160
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:43.360
P12: I understand what the screen's telling you, I don't… but it… again, like I said before.

161
00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:49.650
Moderator: Okay, so you think it's… You understand most of it? Does that sound correct?

162
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:58.299
P12: I understand the words, I just don't understand if I'm not eligible for, CHAMP VA, why am I not… then… why am I not eligible for TRICARE either?

163
00:15:58.630 --> 00:15:59.310
Moderator: Gotcha.

164
00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:01.470
P12: if I'm disab… if I'm permanently disabled.

165
00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:03.010
Moderator: Alright.

166
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:05.560
Moderator: So that's a little bit unclear to you there.

167
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.299
P12: Yeah, this doesn't make sense to me.

168
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.460
Moderator: Gotcha. Alright. And then go ahead and scroll down to the bottom. We'll…

169
00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.780
Moderator: You can press continue down there.

170
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.059
Moderator: And then that would take you back to the…

171
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:25.910
Moderator: the main screen here. And then for our next task, we'll switch over to the We'll prototype blueberry.

172
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.909
Moderator: Go ahead and click into there.

173
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:36.670
Moderator: And then this is gonna be the same as before, but on this page, it's the same as the previous form. So go ahead and scroll to the bottom here.

174
00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:39.180
Moderator: And then you can click the,

175
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:42.440
Moderator: The link to begin the form without signing in.

176
00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:54.839
Moderator: And then, Sam, as before, please go through the next few questions, and then remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here.

177
00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:04.010
P12: Alright, same thing before, it's pretty easy, to determine, you know, this is who I am or what I'm looking for.

178
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:15.770
P12: Or, you know, what bucket I fit in. So then I'm gonna do continue. My name's still the same, which is pretty much everything's obvious, my name, my phone number, my social.

179
00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:35.690
P12: Are you permanently and totally disabled? This is new. I don't remember that. So, yes. Oh, no, it was on there. So, yes, you know, easy choice. You know, I'd be kind of hard to put, I don't know, so I understand why there's only a yes or no question.

180
00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.519
P12: Are you, eligible for TRICARE?

181
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:48.969
P12: or enrolled in TRICARE. So here, I think it should be whether you think you're eligible, enrolled.

182
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:54.909
P12: Or, you know, I don't know, or no. I think there should be 4 radio buttons.

183
00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:57.620
Moderator: I'm sorry, what's the fourth one you were thinking?

184
00:17:58.020 --> 00:18:02.009
P12: So, it should be eligible, that should be a radio button?

185
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.320
Moderator: Okay. Enrolled as a radio button.

186
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.990
P12: I don't know is a radio button, and no is a radio button.

187
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.660
Moderator: Gotcha.

188
00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:13.350
P12: I think yes should be separated into two. Am I eligible, or am I enrolled?

189
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:15.829
Moderator: I gotcha. Thank you for that feedback.

190
00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:32.779
P12: So, this is what the checkmark, this is telling me…

191
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:40.449
P12: that I'm not eligible. Oh, okay, I see the difference. So… Yeah, that's weird.

192
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:50.430
P12: So, the X… so the previous screen had the X, on that… so it meant that… that, whatchamacallit?

193
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:52.399
P12: So, with the X.

194
00:18:52.860 --> 00:19:01.620
P12: on the first one, it meant that I was, I actually… was,

195
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:09.700
P12: or wasn't… I was eligible for TRICARE, so this check means that I'm not eligible for TRICARE.

196
00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:14.560
Moderator: negative in the previous prototype was throwing you off. Does that sound correct?

197
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.479
P12: That is… that would be accurate.

198
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:16.900
Moderator: Okay.

199
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:27.540
Moderator: And then in the last one, you would exit the application and try to contact someone. What about this one? Would you take the same or different action?

200
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:33.769
P12: I would still do this. I would… I would still, question,

201
00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:45.290
P12: If I'm not, since I'm still… I still… it appears that I'm not eligible for TRICARE.

202
00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:52.099
Moderator: Are you saying that you… you're expecting to be, eligible for TRICARE here?

203
00:19:53.690 --> 00:20:01.560
P12: No, no, no, no, no, no. So, because I'm not eligible for TRICARE… So, it's based on…

204
00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:10.640
P12: So, based on my information, I may be eligible, right? And I'm eligible because… I'm,

205
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:19.299
P12: I'm permanently, totally disabled, and I'm eligible because I'm not eligible for TRICARE, so that would mean I wouldn't… I…

206
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:23.749
P12: So, with this, this means it seems like I'm good to go.

207
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:24.260
Moderator: Okay.

208
00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.640
P12: I would consider this as a positive, that,

209
00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:30.999
P12: I'm good enough to, or I qualify for CHAMPO.

210
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.410
Moderator: Gotcha.

211
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:38.499
Moderator: So in this case, would you stop the application here like you did before, or would you continue?

212
00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:39.769
P12: I would continue.

213
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:40.720
Moderator: Gotcha.

214
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:50.790
Moderator: And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this second prototype?

215
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:57.450
P12: So I think it was easier, just because, it's telling me that I'm not eligible, and I understand that, you know.

216
00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:59.020
Moderator: Right.

217
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.920
P12: That… that makes me eligible for Bishiampo.

218
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.520
Moderator: And then, what rating would you give this, then?

219
00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:06.450
P12: Bye. Bye.

220
00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:12.339
Moderator: Alright, thank you. And then comparing the two prototypes, which one would you prefer to use?

221
00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:14.880
P12: Oh, the second one.

222
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.949
Moderator: A second word.

223
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:26.069
Moderator: Gotcha, thank you for that. And then, thinking about everything that you just saw, was there too much, too little, or just about the right amount of information?

224
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.240
P12: Oh, just about throwing them out.

225
00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:33.339
Moderator: And then, if you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident in doing so?

226
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.740
P12: Yeah.

227
00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.839
Moderator: Alright, and then thank you for that. We're, you can go ahead and press continue.

228
00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:54.650
Moderator: And then that would take you back to the beginning here. For our next task, we are… that's correct, there's two additional tasks down here. For the, next task, go ahead and click on the warning alerts.

229
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:58.339
Moderator: And then in here,

230
00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:14.129
Moderator: There's a couple of scenarios that I'll read to you, and then you can review the message, and then please state any questions you may have, or any feedback that you could provide. So for Alert A, in this scenario, you enter your information, and then you see the following message.

231
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:20.789
Moderator: Please think out loud your thoughts around what this message means, and then explain what action you would take in this scenario.

232
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.940
P12: So,

233
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:44.439
P12: A, if you can't confirm my eligibility, and you can't find my information in the system, the first thing I would do would be go back and make sure that everything's spelled right, and that my numbers are correct.

234
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:47.840
P12: And then B?

235
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:58.460
P12: I… Would try again later, just figuring it's a lag.

236
00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.080
Moderator: Okay. For A up there,

237
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:07.399
Moderator: Would you still continue with your application when you see that error, or…

238
00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:12.580
P12: No, I would… I would go and check my information, so that means I would continue.

239
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.560
Moderator: Okay.

240
00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:18.670
Moderator: And then go ahead and go to… scroll down to Alert C.

241
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.809
Moderator: Same scenario, you type in your information, and then you see the… you see this message.

242
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.830
P12: I would still continue.

243
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:43.199
P12: Because I would just, and then at the end, I would call, but then I'd want to get through it.

244
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:48.129
Moderator: I gotcha. So you would like to get through it, but call to kind of confirm things.

245
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:49.650
P12: Yes.

246
00:23:49.650 --> 00:23:55.919
Moderator: Alright, and then for Alert D, same scenario, you type in your information, and then you see this alert.

247
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.839
P12: I wouldn't go on because it's telling me I'm not eligible.

248
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.890
P12: And you tell me I'm eligible for TRICARE?

249
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.990
Moderator: I gotcha. Is there any additional information you want to see here?

250
00:24:17.730 --> 00:24:29.369
P12: Maybe a link, to… if I'm eligible for TRICARE, then there should be a hyperlink that takes me to, you know, if I'm not, to enroll for TRICARE.

251
00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:33.270
Moderator: Gotcha. Alright, and then finally, Alert E.

252
00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.229
Moderator: The last one there.

253
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:39.750
P12: I'd continue.

254
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.320
Moderator: Just the green says I'm good.

255
00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:42.010
P12: So…

256
00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:53.479
Moderator: So, across all the alert messages that you saw, how confident do you feel you know what to do on a scale of 1 to 5? 1 being not very confident, and 5 being very confident?

257
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.790
P12: Oh, 5. I think I'm good. 5? Alright.

258
00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:57.600
P12: Nope.

259
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:01.109
Moderator: And then, were there any alerts that were confusing or unclear?

260
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.640
P12: No.

261
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.440
Moderator: Alright, and then go ahead and click on the Back to the Prototype menu.

262
00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.630
Moderator: And then scroll down to the bottom.

263
00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.520
Moderator: And then that, summary card.

264
00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:37.920
Moderator: Yep, so on this screen, you'll find four summary cards. The first two, card style A, are from the prototype we just went through, and then the third and fourth card, card style B, are alternative designs. Please take a few moments to look at all four cards before we start talking about them.

265
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.219
P12: That's true of any agenda.

266
00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:00.860
P12: Okay.

267
00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.129
Moderator: Alright, what do you think each card is telling you?

268
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.290
P12: So, the first one,

269
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:24.049
P12: Card style A, I'm gonna go with the left quadrant, upper left quadrant. It's telling me that I'm not eligible for TRICARE, and I'm not… and I'm permanently totally disabled.

270
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:29.090
P12: And that's why we're doing Champ VA.

271
00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:40.830
P12: And on… The upper quadrant on the right, is telling me I have a disability, and…

272
00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.310
P12: It, it, it told me that…

273
00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:57.510
P12: I am eligible for TRICARE, but like I complained about before, the double… the double negative, I don't know, I just… it just looks weird.

274
00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:02.089
Moderator: Gotcha. It doesn't quite… it's not as clear as you would like it to be. Does that sound correct?

275
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.570
Moderator: Alright.

276
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:08.950
Moderator: And then… and then the cardstop… Card style B? Yeah.

277
00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:10.810
Moderator: I agree.

278
00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:14.490
P12: So,

279
00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:25.429
P12: I'm eligible on D, because you have the two check marks on the lower left quadrant.

280
00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:34.369
P12: So I'm eligible, because I'm not eligible for TRICARE, and I'm totally, disabled.

281
00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.299
P12: And… Yeah, I don't, I don't think…

282
00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:47.239
P12: I believe here, it's confusing, because if I'm not eligible, there shouldn't be an X there.

283
00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:49.330
P12: I believe, you know.

284
00:27:49.470 --> 00:28:00.269
P12: Because you're telling me the reasons why. So, to me, the veteran is eligible for TRICARE, and then it should say, yes, there should be a green check, and that's why I'm,

285
00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:03.749
P12: That's why I'm not eligible, just because I'm eligible for TRICARE.

286
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:04.830
Moderator: Gotcha.

287
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:15.649
Moderator: And then, I want to draw your attention to the content above the bullet point of each car. There's a slight difference between car style A and car style B.

288
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:20.289
Moderator: And then, what do you think each car is telling you there?

289
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:34.600
P12: It's telling me why I'm… that I met the eligibility requirements. And then, the other one on lower quad… right quadrant, it's telling me that, I didn't meet all the requirements for CHAMPA, and…

290
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:43.999
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, which of these sets, it's the easiest to understand at a glance?

291
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:46.139
P12: Oh, the double check marks?

292
00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:49.020
Moderator: The double check mark, gotcha.

293
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:55.610
Moderator: And then besides, comparing the car style A and then car style B, which one do you…

294
00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.120
Moderator: find easier.

295
00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:02.169
Moderator: So the top two quadrant, and then the bottom two quadrants.

296
00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:09.820
P12: Tard view.

297
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.799
Moderator: Carpy, and why is that?

298
00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:31.190
P12: just from the little statement on the top that just says your responses met all the eligibility requirements, so that's telling me why. So even if I'm confused with this X here, then at least I know my responses didn't meet the eligibility, so I could at least take a second to think about it and be like, oh.

299
00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:36.860
P12: You know, because I'm eligible for TRICARE, that's what disqualifies me.

300
00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:50.739
P12: Because this means… this check mark means, you know, that this is a requirement, but this means because I'm eligible for cry care, that's why they're Xing me out, this is the reason why I don't qualify.

301
00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.880
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, was there any part of the car that was unclear or confusing?

302
00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:11.629
P12: Like I said, just the… usually the X throws people off. You know, do I say it's confusing? No, but it's… I think this is more clear just having, double green checks, you know, just saying… so even if you had a check here.

303
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:19.780
P12: oh, I'm checked here because I'm eligible for TRICARE, so that's why. And then, when I see my responses in, you know.

304
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.229
P12: It's just, to me, it's just the way I think.

305
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:39.100
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that. And then that ends the screen sharing portion of it, so you no longer have to share your screen. Is there any other feedback that you'd like to add about the two prototypes or the messages that you saw today?

306
00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.860
P12: No, they were… I mean, it was pretty cut and dry.

307
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:48.360
Moderator: Okay, and then, do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

308
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.599
P12: It just,

309
00:30:51.850 --> 00:31:02.909
P12: like I mentioned before, if you're not eligible, because you have availability for TRICARE, then either make the TRICARE a hyperlink, like the words TRICARE a hyperlink.

310
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:14.239
P12: And so they can click on the word TRICARE, and it'll take them to, where they need to sign up for, because it seems like, to me, if they're looking at CHAMPVA, then they're trying to get healthcare from somewhere.

311
00:31:14.610 --> 00:31:16.680
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that feedback.

312
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:24.369
Moderator: I don't see the observers having any questions, and do you have any questions for me?

313
00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:25.510
P12: Nope.

314
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:34.530
Moderator: Alright, I'd like to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.

315
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.850
P12: Yeah, that's fine.

316
00:31:35.850 --> 00:31:50.969
Moderator: Alright, I just want to remind you that we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and it will only share the video with VA partner for the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

317
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:52.520
P12: Sounds fantastic.

318
00:31:52.710 --> 00:32:07.380
Moderator: And then I'd just like to say we appreciate you taking your time and sharing your thoughts with us today. Your feedback's gonna be super helpful for us to continue to work on this and kind of help improve the website and make it work for all veterans and their family members.

319
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:08.770
P12: Alright, thank you.

320
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:10.960
Moderator: And then, finally,

321
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:22.849
Moderator: A reagent will send you, like, a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know to provide them with a chance to participate in future research studies like this one.

322
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.189
Moderator: And then that's it. Enjoy the rest of your day and the long weekend.

323
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.419
P12: Alright, thank you very much, have a good one.
