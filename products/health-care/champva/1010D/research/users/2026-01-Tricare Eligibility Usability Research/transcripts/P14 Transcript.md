00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.169
Moderator: I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.820
P14: Yes.

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:19.669
Moderator: And then, are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that could be used to identify you?

4
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.350
P14: Yes.

5
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:32.940
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then, I have a couple warm-up questions for you here. Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the CHAMPA program?

6
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.580
P14: No.

7
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.609
Moderator: Have you ever heard of the Champa program before?

8
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.420
P14: Yes.

9
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.639
Moderator: In your own word, can you, can you explain to me what you know about the eligibility of that program?

10
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:58.880
P14: from my understanding, it's for, like, caregivers or family members of veterans that don't have access to any other kind of healthcare, so they can access CHAMPVA to get healthcare.

11
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.510
Moderator: And then, have you ever heard of TRICARE?

12
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.380
P14: Yes.

13
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.869
Moderator: Can you explain the difference between the TRICARE and CHAMPA?

14
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:16.519
P14: Tricare is provided to, military retirees, or, medical retirees, but it's the active duty

15
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:27.959
P14: more so component of, medical insurance for service members and their families. It does… can transfer over, again, if there's a retirement or a medical retirement.

16
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.290
P14: And it's different because,

17
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:40.210
P14: not everyone has access to TRICARE after their loved one's service, hence why they'd be looking for CHAMP VA to fill that gap in medical insurance.

18
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:51.370
Moderator: Okay, thank you for that. So I'm gonna share a link with you in the chat of the prototype, and then I would like for you to open it in a browser and then share your Zoom screen.

19
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.019
Moderator: So, I just want to confirm that you are on a desktop or a laptop of sorts?

20
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.099
P14: I'm on a laptop.

21
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.700
Moderator: Okay, I can give you that.

22
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.160
Moderator: Then I have shared the link in the chat.

23
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.210
Moderator: Let me know if you have any trouble so I can help you walk through that.

24
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.930
Moderator: It takes a little bit of time to load everything.

25
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.239
Moderator: Alright, I see it.

26
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:32.470
Moderator: Alright, so for the first task, you see that we have two buttons there. Go ahead and click on Prototype Blueberry.

27
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.420
P14: Okay.

28
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:44.619
Moderator: So we'll go through this prototype first. On this first page, please take a minute or so to look over the instruction, and then when you're ready, in your own word, tell me what this means to you.

29
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.869
P14: Are you still seeing my screen?

30
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.199
Moderator: Yeah, I see your screen.

31
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.550
P14: Okay, I don't know why… hold on 2 seconds, for whatever reason, I'm not seeing it.

32
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.640
Moderator: You're not seeing your own screen?

33
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.730
P14: Okay, here we go.

34
00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.560
Moderator: Okay.

35
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.039
P14: So, can you repeat the instructions?

36
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.549
Moderator: Yeah, absolutely. So, on this first page, please take a minute or so to look over the instruction, and when you're ready, in your own word, tell me what this means to you.

37
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.490
P14: Okay.

38
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.560
P14: Okay.

39
00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:02.650
P14: Okay, I like that it's numbered. That's helpful. I like that it has this kind of disclaimer. If you've already applied, like, don't apply again. You can…

40
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:19.810
P14: see what you can do after you apply it. I think it's really important to have that kind of above this, because I've heard from other, caregivers specifically that they apply for things multiple times because they're not sure they applied yet, and then I know sometimes having all of those applications, slows the process down.

41
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.819
P14: Finding out if you're… I would click on this, this would be, like, the first thing I would check to make sure.

42
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:46.249
P14: I do think… so, this note, if you're eligible for TRICARE, this could be bolded, because I don't know if people are necessarily going to read down there if they don't open this. I'm assuming if you click on this, it'll also tell you this note about TRICARE, but you could bold that a little bit to make sure people who do have TRICARE aren't going to try and, you know.

43
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.130
P14: Waste their time with, gathering information and actually applying.

44
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.180
P14: This is helpful to gather the information.

45
00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.980
P14: The other health insurance certification?

46
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.579
P14: Again, nice to have the live links out. I always like to have a little checklist of things that I might need, so this is helpful.

47
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:21.030
P14: Starting the application. I probably would expect there to be, like, a start button here, or, like, click that… this, and it will take me right to the application.

48
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.420
P14: And then, after, they'll apply. So, then you have to sign in with a verified account.

49
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.179
Moderator: Okay, and then in your own word, what is this application for?

50
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.080
P14: This is the application to apply for CHAMP VA.

51
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.990
Moderator: And then who is eligible to apply?

52
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.040
P14: I would have had to click this to check.

53
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:49.390
P14: Does this open?

54
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.499
Moderator: Yeah, it does.

55
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.699
P14: Oh, okay, my apologies, I should have checked.

56
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.620
Moderator: No, not an issue.

57
00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:07.660
P14: eligibility… oh gosh, so it's one of those VA things where there's a ton of different eligibility requirements. Okay. So, like I said, this would be something, if I was going to click through, this would… I would read this pretty thoroughly beforehand.

58
00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:15.160
P14: Because I don't ever want to apply for something that I'm not eligible for, so I would take the time to read this line by line to make sure.

59
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.749
P14: Okay, at least one of these must be true.

60
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.750
Moderator: Gotcha.

61
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.140
P14: Okay, surviving spouse, dependent child who died.

62
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.280
P14: Okay.

63
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.640
P14: And… At the time of their death.

64
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.570
P14: Okay.

65
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.739
P14: Okay, so if you get TRICARE, again, you cannot get CHAMPA. I think it's good that that's noted a few times.

66
00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.549
P14: Oh gosh, so it goes into all of this.

67
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.839
P14: Spouses that are both veterans.

68
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.340
P14: So these are all the different primary caregivers. These are all the different… I'm assuming this would open and tell you

69
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:18.460
P14: you know, the eligibility. But basically, at least one of these have to be true. So, the people that are eligible are spouses and dependents of veterans who've been rated P&T from a service-connected disability, or surviving spouses

70
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:30.570
P14: Does this dependent child be, like, a surviving dependent child? Like, the same as a surviving spouse, this would be a surviving dependent child of a veteran who died from service-connected disability.

71
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:38.080
P14: or you're the surviving spouse or dependent child of a veteran who was, at the time of their death, rated PNT

72
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.480
P14: Disabled from a service-connected disability.

73
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:42.660
P14: Okay.

74
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.690
P14: And again, if you have TRICARE, you do not qualify.

75
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:49.610
Moderator: Okay, then you can go ahead and click on the Return to Prototype.

76
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.050
P14: Where is that?

77
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.020
Moderator: At the top, the very top, you see that blue button? Yeah, right there.

78
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.839
P14: Oh, here we go.

79
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.390
Moderator: So, I want you to scroll down to the step 1 there.

80
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.630
P14: Okay.

81
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:12.319
Moderator: where it says, in the center, where it says, we'll also help you check your eligibility when you complete this form. What is your expectation, if any, when you read this sentence?

82
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.530
P14: When you're filling out the form, if you,

83
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:32.559
P14: it has, like, a yes or no. Like, if you click yes, I have TRICARE, it'll automatically stop the application and say, I'm sorry, you're not eligible. Or if you're, like, a parent instead of a spouse, it would say, you know, you're not eligible. So basically, it catches you

84
00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:38.460
P14: At the moment, you kind of say that you're ineligible, the form stops you from completing the rest of the form.

85
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.580
Moderator: Okay, and then is there anything that makes you uncertain about applying?

86
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:44.880
P14: No.

87
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:52.509
Moderator: Now, if you were… if you wanted to apply today for real, would you continue, or would you want more information first?

88
00:08:56.390 --> 00:09:00.070
P14: So I would not be eligible, because I do have TRICARE.

89
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:06.220
P14: So I would say, like, at this point, I don't qualify for it. However, I would probably…

90
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:12.130
P14: I don't know if this is the case, but, you know, if you are a dependent child.

91
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.499
P14: but you age out of TRICARE, do you then qualify for

92
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.269
P14: CHAMP VA, there might be some questions there.

93
00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:24.480
Moderator: Gotcha. So there's enough of a gray area for you to really question that.

94
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:33.860
P14: Yeah, I would… I would dig in. I would open all of those tabs and try to apply whatever specific scenario to the tabs in the find out if you're eligible before I would even.

95
00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:40.099
Moderator: Keep going. So you're more likely to look for more additional information before continuing?

96
00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.620
P14: Yeah, no, I know a lot of,

97
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:52.810
P14: you know, from just my work with different VA benefits, that some of them have very strict eligibility, and I wouldn't want to apply for something that I wasn't absolutely sure I was eligible for.

98
00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:53.740
Moderator: Gotcha.

99
00:09:53.920 --> 00:10:04.659
Moderator: And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

100
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:15.639
P14: based on this… I mean, it tells you how long it's gonna take, it tells you what documents… I would say 5, pretty informed about what you're gonna need to do.

101
00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:22.389
Moderator: Okay, that sounds good. And then go ahead and move to,

102
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:38.469
Moderator: towards the bottom there, in that sign-in box, so go ahead and click on that, yeah, click on the… there. And then, since this is a prototype, we pre-fill all of the information you normally type in if you're going through this for real.

103
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:49.340
Moderator: Please go through the next few questions and remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here, and then when you're ready, click on the continue button.

104
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.660
P14: Okay, so it says you won't need to upload the veteran's DD214.

105
00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:14.609
P14: Okay, you must meet this. If you're not eligible, this may delay for other benefits. Yeah, see, that… I feel like it's good to call that out. I know that. I'm always terrified to, like, hold up a spot for someone who is eligible for the benefit versus people that sometimes apply for benefits just to see if they can get them, even if they know they're not eligible.

106
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.619
P14: Okay. I am the spouse.

107
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.980
P14: Dependent or survivor of a veteran applying for benefits for myself.

108
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:33.780
P14: I am a veteran applying. Okay, so either or, you can do it kind of as self-service, or you can have the veteran do it.

109
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.820
P14: Or someone else can do it all together. Okay.

110
00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:41.699
P14: Would that be, like, a VSO or someone who's trying to help you with this process?

111
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.720
Moderator: Is that, what you…

112
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:49.150
P14: For the one I'm applying for benefits on behalf of someone else, like a case manager or someone?

113
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.910
P14: And then… I'm guessing that.

114
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.320
Moderator: Top of your mind? Okay.

115
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:59.279
P14: Yeah, that's what I… that's what I would assume. I don't think people just come in here and apply for benefits for people, but maybe they do.

116
00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.729
P14: Okay, then I like that it says, finish this application later.

117
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:24.709
P14: I don't know what that does, but if it could save my process or my progress, that's helpful in any type of application, because I know as a caregiver, I sometimes get pulled away from things, even if I've dedicated time to, due to caregiving responsibilities, and it's incredibly frustrating to have to go back and redo the entire application, because there wasn't a save.

118
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.080
P14: you know, my progress button. So, I noticed that already, that caught my eye.

119
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.350
Moderator: Good feedback. Thank you.

120
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:32.520
P14: Bam.

121
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.469
P14: Okay, so I…

122
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:52.590
P14: people get nervous sometimes about sharing the social security number, and I know it says required, and sometimes with veteran benefits, it's different, but are wondering if we could… if there might be a different number to use, like a service…

123
00:12:53.430 --> 00:13:07.180
P14: I just know, like, that gets flagged in… in my community. People are like, how many times am I supposed to enter the social security number? And didn't the DoD go through all this work to make sure you didn't have to have a social security number? You could have a DoD number? So,

124
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:18.979
P14: just people might… that might be a bit of a turn-off that it's required. I know it's a government thing, but people are always very, very nervous about their personal information, especially the social security number, because of identity theft.

125
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:22.820
P14: So I don't know, I saw ID.me on the…

126
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:36.739
P14: the first page, or, like, on the application page, and I think a lot of veterans and families are comfortable using those kind of logins, where they've verified, you know, through a different means, besides having to, you know, put in your social security number.

127
00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:48.530
P14: I found that, especially with our older generations, like, older veterans really don't want to share their social security number, and younger veterans seem to ask why they can't use their DOD number.

128
00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.489
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that.

129
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.560
P14: Okay.

130
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:13.410
P14: Just from some work in the survivor space, kind of answer to the best of your knowledge, has the veteran died?

131
00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.279
P14: I… I feel like… I don't know, that just is rubbing me wrong.

132
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.450
P14: to the best of your knowledge, has someone died? That's like… I don't know why you wouldn't know that.

133
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:25.990
P14: Okay.

134
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:27.860
Moderator: So you would remove the second…

135
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:38.750
P14: Yeah, just answer to the best of your knowledge. I mean, that might be good for some other things, or some other parts of the veteran status, but if it leads with, did the veteran die, just being more sensitive to survivors.

136
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:53.110
P14: They know that, and so sometimes I feel that question might hit a survivor in the wrong way. So, again, we'll ask more questions about those in detail, but I would probably remove answer to the best of your knowledge from this question specifically.

137
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.170
Moderator: Right, thank you for that feedback.

138
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.430
P14: No words.

139
00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:21.939
P14: So here, you could say, answer to the best of your ability, because people don't always know if they have that PNT, or if their disability is service-connected. And then I see you have, how do we define service-connected? It might also be helpful to have what is defined as permanent and total, because that is another area people don't always necessarily understand. And then again, if it's just

140
00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:26.130
P14: This one, you could say, answer to the best of your ability, but not that first one.

141
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:36.640
P14: Okay, is the veteran eligible or enrolled in TRICARE?

142
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.950
P14: I feel like the people that have this definitely know.

143
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.450
P14: that they have it. I… I feel like there might be a lot of I don't-knows.

144
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.670
P14: So people would be like, how do I check my TRICARE eligibility?

145
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.470
P14: Does this link work, or is this still prototype?

146
00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.180
Moderator: You can, it's not quite a link, it's a drop-down, yeah.

147
00:15:59.180 --> 00:15:59.780
P14: Okay.

148
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.370
P14: So then it makes you go to the TRICARE website to see if you're eligible over there.

149
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:07.020
Moderator: Right.

150
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.170
P14: Okay.

151
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:22.110
P14: I'm just thinking, if I was a family member and I didn't know

152
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:35.609
P14: this would be, like, again, I would probably pause this application and say, like, okay, save it up to here, and then I would go check my eligibility on the TRICARE website before I move forward. Or I would click, I don't know,

153
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:42.339
P14: And hope that this application would catch that or figure it out for me. Or there's some other way you're… excuse me.

154
00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:45.090
P14: checking my TRICARE eligibility.

155
00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:46.220
Moderator: Gotcha.

156
00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:48.960
P14: Before I, you know, could continue.

157
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.690
Moderator: Right.

158
00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.779
P14: Okay, the veteran is… okay, so it does give you the check boxes back.

159
00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:02.200
P14: That this is why you meet… if you didn't meet all the requirements, you can exit.

160
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.639
P14: Okay, but it says maybe eligible, and then if you didn't.

161
00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:18.799
P14: If you met all of the other… or sync the application, you can… okay, so it gives me the two green checkboxes, which…

162
00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:21.030
P14: me and I could be eligible.

163
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.969
P14: I'm assuming it would have, like, a red X, like, if it wasn't…

164
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:31.489
P14: appropriate, and I could just exit here, but I'm assuming I do, so I'm gonna just keep going.

165
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.810
Moderator: Alright.

166
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:33.500
P14: Back here.

167
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:42.599
Moderator: So, I'm gonna pause you there. In your own word, what happens, tell me what happened on that previous eligibility page.

168
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:58.560
P14: I got 2 green marks, two green checks indicating that I was the spouse of a permanently and total disabled veteran, so I may be eligible. And I got a check that I was not eligible for TRICARE, which continued my eligibility for CHAMPBA.

169
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.899
P14: And then I was able to hit continue.

170
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.899
P14: The application.

171
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:09.170
P14: And it also did have a note, if I wasn't eligible, I could stop the application.

172
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:13.279
Moderator: And then, what does the icon or checkmark mean to you?

173
00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:17.570
P14: Those green checkmarks indicated that I may be eligible.

174
00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.990
Moderator: Okay. And then, based on this, do you think you're eligible for, CHAMFA?

175
00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.100
P14: Yes.

176
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.060
Moderator: And then, how confident are you in that understanding?

177
00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.140
P14: Pretty confident.

178
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:42.309
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, I guess you already went ahead here, but what would you do next if you were really applying today, so you went and continue on? Is that correct?

179
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.259
P14: Yep, oh, I would continue, the application, because…

180
00:18:46.420 --> 00:19:02.579
P14: again, I said I… because on that very first page, it said, you will help me with my eligibility, the site says it'll help me with my eligibility. Because I got those two green check marks, I'm assuming that I've gone through the eligibility check, and I'm cleared to keep… continue the application.

181
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:03.460
Moderator: Okay.

182
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:12.050
Moderator: And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand that screen?

183
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:28.950
P14: with the green checkmarks, so there… I'm only going to give it a 4, because where it says you may be eligible, it doesn't say you are eligible, and I know there's more things they need to, and then it also indicates if you're not eligible, you can stop here. So it wasn't night, like.

184
00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:48.070
P14: it wasn't incredibly clear that I, yes, was. I mean, I would keep going based on that information, but someone might see that it says you may, which doesn't say you are, and the fact that you can exit out if you're not, like, eligible, that might cause someone to stop applying because they don't know.

185
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:52.990
P14: If… if that… if that was completely clear that they're good to go forward.

186
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.989
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that feedback.

187
00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:02.249
Moderator: And then for the second portion here, go ahead and click on the prototype pineapple, so that orange button.

188
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:13.480
Moderator: Okay. So for this prototype, we are going to proceed the same way. This is the same page as before, so you can go ahead and scroll down to the bottom, and click…

189
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.850
Moderator: I believe… start your form without signing in.

190
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:18.500
P14: Okay.

191
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:29.279
Moderator: Go ahead and, same process where you're going through the next few questions, and remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here.

192
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:40.480
P14: Okay, again, I like that it says I don't need to upload the veteran's DD214, but I'm wondering, because… oh, I'll just wait till I get to that screen. Okay, so you must meet all the eligibility.

193
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:49.200
P14: you won't need to upload the veteran's DD214. So already, I'm thinking I don't have to provide things like a social security number or dates of service. I'm assuming…

194
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.029
P14: Okay, I am the spouse.

195
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:59.979
P14: of a veteran applying for benefits for myself, and again, I love that they have to finish the application later.

196
00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:06.829
P14: I will just note, like, the 1 of 7, the eligibility, I don't know.

197
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:14.520
P14: If, it's going through those numbers properly, but that could just be the prototype. So here I'm going to enter the name.

198
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:25.730
P14: Again, so when I see the social security number, I wonder, like, why don't they already know this? I know I didn't put up a DD214, but might be nervous to share my social security number.

199
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.979
P14: It's the only hesitance here.

200
00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:43.969
P14: And it says, okay, based on the veteran's information, the applicant is… may not be eligible for CHAMPA. We found in DEERS for TRICARE, so even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHAMPA because

201
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.779
P14: benefits if you're eligible for TRICARE.

202
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.930
Moderator: Okay. So, again, it's stopping you, which is good, you don't want to keep going.

203
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.450
P14: So they're saying, okay, so this system is checking deers.

204
00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:08.700
P14: even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHAMP VA, because If you're eligible for TRICARE.

205
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:21.149
P14: One thing that would be helpful here might be, like, okay, so I'm eligible for TRICARE, or maybe eligible for TRICARE? Click here to figure out why you're not using TRICARE if you're eligible for it.

206
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.140
Moderator: Okay.

207
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.609
P14: That would be helpful to redirect over to, you know, the…

208
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:28.230
P14: DEERS, or wherever you're getting this information.

209
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.900
Moderator: I have several questions for you on here.

210
00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:36.190
Moderator: How do you feel about the way this application checks your eligibility?

211
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:52.830
P14: So, again, I know, VA benefits are rather nuanced, but anytime you say, may not be eligible instead of you are not eligible, people might still try to continue because they think perhaps there's an error. Or, again, because they say it says.

212
00:22:52.980 --> 00:23:11.499
P14: Even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible because you're eligible for TRICARE. If they aren't using TRICARE or don't understand that, they might still keep pushing forward because, again, it says, may not be eligible for CHAMP VA benefits. It doesn't say, you are absolutely not eligible for CHAMP VA benefits.

213
00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.440
Moderator: Gotcha.

214
00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:16.229
Moderator: And then, does it feel helpful, intrusive, or something else?

215
00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:28.059
P14: No, again, I feel like if this were me, and I was applying, and it was like, oh, no, you, based on this information, it looks like you're eligible for TRICARE,

216
00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:44.649
P14: I… I just would wish it would redirect me to TRICARE to get that figured out, because obviously I'm looking for health insurance, and I'm trying to figure out what my options are, and if I'm not eligible for CHAMP VA, and you're saying you're eligible for TRICARE, a push to the TRICARE site would be very helpful.

217
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:49.440
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, do you trust that this information is accurate?

218
00:23:49.440 --> 00:24:08.550
P14: No. Again, I feel like people, because it says may not, you could assume maybe there was an error, or the veteran's record isn't correct, or something, so you probably wouldn't trust this, again, because it says may not be eligible. And it's not redirecting you to TRICARE to get that figured out. I might just keep going with the application.

219
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:21.840
Moderator: Gotcha. So, it sounds like there's a couple things that you want here. One is essentially a link to TRICARE, and then also it sounded like you would… because it's not the,

220
00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.390
Moderator: The statement is not definitive. You would continue on, does that sound correct?

221
00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:27.230
P14: Correct.

222
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:34.960
Moderator: Alright. And then, if you believe this check was wrong, and you're not actually eligible for TRICARE, what would you do?

223
00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:47.510
P14: So if I know I'm not eligible for TRICARE, or… I would just keep going. I would still try to get CHAMPVA, because I would know I'm not, you know, I'm not using TRICARE, it's not there.

224
00:24:47.940 --> 00:25:00.560
P14: I'm not… obviously, I feel like people only ever sign up for Champ VA because they don't have any other access to insurance. So if this is saying, you have access to insurance over there, I would want to get over there as fast as possible.

225
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:08.269
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, does this feel like the system is helping you understand your option, or is the system blocking you from applying?

226
00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:15.409
P14: I think it's really helpful that it says they found the veteran's information in DEERS.

227
00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:26.509
P14: and really, again, just to tie the bow on that, or to close the loop, would be to send them to TRICARE to try to get that figured out. Like, start here in TRICARE, or…

228
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:32.840
P14: you know, here's a number for TRICARE to call. Something like that, that would be very helpful.

229
00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:40.379
P14: But I do feel like this is helping you, you know, you might, but again, because it's not a definitive statement, you might still keep going.

230
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:41.430
Moderator: Gotcha.

231
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:51.239
P14: And because it doesn't redirect you to TRICARE to get, you know, maybe your insurance needs solved over there, again, you might just keep going in CHAMPVA to see what you can get.

232
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.300
Moderator: That makes sense, thank you. And then you can go ahead and continue, so you can just scroll down.

233
00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:02.119
P14: And again, I would just… the answer to the best of your knowledge.

234
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:02.930
Moderator: Right.

235
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:05.050
Moderator: I'm gonna take that out.

236
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.460
P14: Yeah.

237
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.219
P14: I'll take that out…

238
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:19.009
P14: Permanently and totaled. And again, my note here would be, like, how you define service-connected disability.

239
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:31.169
P14: I don't think… okay, so that does have it. A veteran is permanently and totally disabled if they have a disability that we've rated 100% disabling, and that's not expected to improve.

240
00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:45.070
P14: Okay, so that wording on the permanent and total,

241
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:54.669
P14: I would note that you can see that on your rating letter, because people will say they have 100%

242
00:26:54.860 --> 00:27:02.769
P14: they're 100% disabled, and they're not expected to get better, right? Like, but they do not… they still do not have that permanent and total

243
00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:18.600
P14: or P&T on their letters, or their ratings. So, it's not just that the VA's decided that you're 100% disabled, because there's a lot of people that are 100% disabled, and you might hear from your provider, it's not expected to improve.

244
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:27.379
P14: Yet, you still do not have the P&T designation on your record, and then, again, you wouldn't be eligible.

245
00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.859
P14: for this.

246
00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:30.150
Moderator: Gotcha.

247
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.720
P14: So just the P&T, that's the one that I… I had the hardest time understanding at first. I was like.

248
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:40.649
P14: Of course, it's permanent, he's never gonna, you know, his arm's not going to grow back.

249
00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:42.250
P14: But…

250
00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:54.909
P14: if you don't have the PNT noted, it's very hard for people to know for sure that's what they have. That language kind of talks about, yeah, you're 100% disabled, which could be a rating.

251
00:27:54.910 --> 00:28:04.439
P14: And it's not expected to improve, because you've talked to providers about it, but you still don't have that designation, because it's an important designation to really call that out.

252
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.930
P14: And then the service-connected… That's pretty…

253
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.730
P14: Or made worse by their active duty service.

254
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:24.710
P14: Just a caregiver note on that. Some conditions get worse,

255
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:36.760
P14: And it's not because of the active duty, like, maybe the injury happened on active duty, but they're degenerative, so, it just keeps getting worse. I don't know if that needs to be called out here, but…

256
00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:47.099
P14: This, how you define service-connected disability, and really calling out the permanent and total, or PNT, rating, is going to be very key to people hitting yes or no here.

257
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:50.750
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that feedback.

258
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.359
P14: Do you want me to keep going?

259
00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.429
Moderator: Yes, please.

260
00:29:03.430 --> 00:29:03.990
P14: Okay.

261
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:21.249
P14: Yeah, so I know these probably would be one of seven, they're all 1, but it… that is helpful to see you kind of moving across this bar, so I'm sure that's just a prototype thing, but these sort of steps and calling them out are very helpful for people, so appreciate that.

262
00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:26.040
P14: Is the veteran or any applicants eligible or enrolled in TRICARE?

263
00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:35.030
P14: See, and this one will send you over to TRICARE.

264
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:46.809
P14: To check your eligibility. And again, I would… this is where I would finish this application later, and I would go check if I was unsure, but in my case, I know, yes, I have TRICARE.

265
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:48.620
Moderator: Gotcha.

266
00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:51.540
Moderator: Go ahead and continue.

267
00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:52.310
P14: Okay.

268
00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:05.789
P14: Okay, so again, I love the green… like, these are helpful. The green… okay, the veteran is permanently and totally disabled.

269
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:11.519
P14: Or the veteran died from a service-connected disability, or the veteran at the time of their death was P&T.

270
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.520
P14: Okay, the veteran.

271
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.429
P14: or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

272
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.509
P14: And it's got an X there, so…

273
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.379
P14: I read that as, we're not eligible because of this X.

274
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.860
P14: If you do not meet all the requirements, you can exit this application.

275
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:52.150
P14: Okay, so again, it's not… it kind of doesn't make sense here, too. You may not be eligible, and here you can exit if you don't think that's right, or maybe you're just going to keep going, because you think you meet all of the eligibility requirements, like, especially this TRICARE one, like, I don't have TRICARE, we don't use TRICARE, I would have TRICARE,

276
00:30:52.290 --> 00:31:01.210
P14: But we don't, so this is why I'm trying to get Champ VA. I would continue here.

277
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:01.970
Moderator: Gotcha.

278
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.559
P14: I would probably still keep going.

279
00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:07.900
P14: Because, again, I feel like most people that are…

280
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.069
P14: if you had access to TRICARE, I don't know why that would fall away.

281
00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.149
P14: While you would try to get Champier.

282
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:19.070
Moderator: Gotcha. That makes a lot of sense. I'll pause you right there.

283
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.970
P14: Okay. On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and…

284
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.439
Moderator: 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to understand this second prototype?

285
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.870
P14: This one's a little bit more challenging,

286
00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:40.669
P14: I feel like I understand the green checkmarks and the X's, but I don't know if that's…

287
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.660
P14: like, I don't know if my veteran would know that, if he was filling it out.

288
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:55.770
P14: And then again, with the vague language, may not be. If you didn't, that gets it a little bit harder, and again, I know a lot of VA

289
00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:58.870
P14: Benefits are very nuanced.

290
00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:07.329
P14: But if the… like, this seems like it's just a screener to see if you are eligible, and I don't know if it's… it would be… I… I feel like…

291
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:26.589
P14: if I knew I didn't have TRICARE, even though it says this veteran could have TRICARE, I would still go forward with this application, because I would assume there was some error that they are pulling something from TRICARE that's not true, or they have the wrong veteran's information, or the, you know, there's an error somewhere, because we don't have TRICARE, I need CHAMPVA, I would still keep going.

292
00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:31.879
Moderator: Gotcha, that makes sense. And then comparing the two… I'm sorry, I don't think…

293
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:51.039
P14: So, did I give a rating? So I would give this one a 3. This one's a little bit harder to wrap around, and I feel like I would still do the application, but the whole time, I'd be like, I'm not sure if I'm 100% supposed to do this, but this wasn't clear enough. It's a little wishy-washy with the may or the if, so I'm just gonna go for the whole application and hope for the best.

294
00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.139
Moderator: It's not definitive, so you'll continue.

295
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.599
P14: see what you get. I gotcha.

296
00:32:55.710 --> 00:33:02.820
Moderator: And then, just thinking about everything that you saw, was there too much, too little, or about the right amount of information?

297
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:18.120
P14: So I did like that it linked out to DEERS. I feel like… I don't know if DEERS is catching you over there, like, it would be really great if you got over to Deers, and it said, hey, it looks like you're trying to get your eligibility for…

298
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:36.929
P14: CHAMP VA, if there could be some kind of… and I know there's not a lot of DOD and VA connection, but if it were to able to walk you through, the VA eligibility screener has indicated you're veteran and you might be eligible for TRICARE. Let's figure that out, and then TRICARE could walk you through their own eligibility.

299
00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:56.529
P14: And then you could have a better understanding of what your next steps were if you were eligible for TRICARE, or they could say, no, you don't have TRICARE, keep going with the CHAMP VA. But I, I mean, I know that's more on their side, but it would be lovely if these systems could talk to each other, especially with eligibility, so people didn't

300
00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:57.290
P14: clog up.

301
00:33:57.490 --> 00:34:04.249
P14: These sort of applications when they're not eligible, or really streamline it for people that are eligible and get them in faster.

302
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:11.699
Moderator: And then, if you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident in doing so?

303
00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:27.100
P14: Yep, I would be saying, like, just make sure you don't have any of those red X's when you go through the 7 eligibility steps, and if you do have a red X and you're not sure, then you have to go over to TRICARE, and I would explain, like, how to go through DEERS to see what's going on.

304
00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:33.300
P14: If you, for some reason, were eligible for TRICARE but didn't… aren't using it.

305
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:39.750
Moderator: Gotcha. Alright, thank you for that. We can go ahead and press the continue button on the bottom there. Okay.

306
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:53.940
Moderator: takes you back to the main menu, and then since we finished the two prototype, there is a couple additional messages that I want to go through with you. Basically, additional scenarios. If you scroll down to the bottom.

307
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:58.820
Moderator: you'll see… Two buttons here, go ahead and click on the, warning alerts.

308
00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:00.430
P14: Okay.

309
00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:17.589
Moderator: So, I'm gonna read a scenario, and then when you… and then you'll review the message, and then please state any question and any feedback that you could provide. So, for Alert A, in this scenario, you enter the veteran's information, and then you see the following message.

310
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:25.040
P14: Okay, we can't confirm the eligibility of the applicants right now. We couldn't find the veteran's information in our system.

311
00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.310
P14: Okay, yeah.

312
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:39.150
P14: So this happens, this happens to people all the time. This is why, again, I think people push through, because they're like, oh, they couldn't find their information, or the information's wrong.

313
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:51.329
P14: I know people have had, like, the wrong birthdate for their veteran, and, you know, they have everything in there, but the VA has the wrong birthdate, so they can't find them in the system, and it's kind of a mess to get.

314
00:35:51.330 --> 00:36:05.930
P14: checked out. So it says, if you think this is an error, check the information you entered, and I bet you go back and you put in the information, you make sure it's correct, you hit it again, and it will send… it will give you this alert again, which would be kind of frustrating, because there's no…

315
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:13.790
P14: indication, like, what do you do if the information is correct, and they still can't find the veteran? So, what is the next step there?

316
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:20.549
Moderator: So, in your case, you would go ahead and continue through with the application. Does that sound accurate?

317
00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:32.440
P14: Yeah, I would continue the application, and again, just hoping that we could find whatever discrepancy is. Maybe it's a digit off, or the wrong birth year, or something like that. But it is kind of common for…

318
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:42.810
P14: the information not to be as accurate as you would hope, and so people will go through the entire application. And then sometimes… I mean, I hope they're catching that somewhere in there, or there's additional

319
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:55.559
P14: you know, checks for eligibility or checks of the veteran's record, but I would keep going here, especially if I knew the veteran's name is correct, the birthday's correct, and the social security is correct, but they're still saying they can't find this veteran.

320
00:36:55.700 --> 00:37:06.820
P14: I know he's a veteran, you know, I would keep going and hoping I'm putting in information, or someone would reach back out to me to try to figure out what information might be wrong, so we could get set up with Champ VA.

321
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:11.730
Moderator: Gotcha, thank you for that. And then go ahead and scroll down to Alert B.

322
00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:12.180
P14: Okay.

323
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:17.529
Moderator: Same scenario of you enter the veteran's information, and then you see that message.

324
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:27.709
P14: Okay, we can't confirm the eligibility of the applicants right now. You can try again later, or continue to complete your application. I would complete my application here.

325
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:29.040
Moderator: Okay.

326
00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.460
Moderator: I'll go ahead and go to Alert C, then.

327
00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:33.920
P14: Okay.

328
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.160
Moderator: Same scenario?

329
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:46.840
P14: Okay, and so, for me, I read this like the eligibility tool can't figure out who my veteran is. If you think this is an error, check the information you entered, or select continue.

330
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.909
P14: To complete your application.

331
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:54.250
P14: So, what I would write here, or select continue to complete your application.

332
00:37:54.420 --> 00:38:11.609
P14: you… yeah, if you think this is an error, check the information you entered. If the information is correct, you can select continue to complete your application, because I… you know your veteran's date of birth. I mean, even if you did the double check, you know, you know the social security number, you know their name.

333
00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:17.050
P14: So, if you check the information, you think it's still correct, and the error is that

334
00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:23.140
P14: the eligibility tool can't find your veteran, you would keep going. You would continue the application.

335
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.949
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that. And then go ahead, alert D, same scenario.

336
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:29.550
P14: Okay?

337
00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:48.210
P14: Okay, so again, with the non-definitive language, which I think most, most caregivers, most family members know, it's very nuanced. A lot of veteran things are nuanced, so they may not

338
00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.550
P14: I mean…

339
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:59.720
P14: they might take that as non-definitive, so keep going. But the fact that it says here that, you know, we found your veteran's information in DEERS,

340
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:10.909
P14: And then even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHAMP VA benefits if you're eligible for TRICARE. I would put that link to the TRICARE website there to, like.

341
00:39:11.650 --> 00:39:23.379
P14: or, you know, go to TRICARE to figure out your TRICARE eligibility. I would have that link in there, because that's more helpful than just saying, hey, we found your information over there.

342
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:31.010
P14: If you're eligible for TRICARE, you're not eligible for CHAMPA, so here, get started with TRICARE, and here's the link. That would be helpful.

343
00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:33.699
Moderator: Gotcha. So here's where you want the link to trycare.

344
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:35.830
P14: Like, right after here, you should be like.

345
00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:54.130
P14: to visit TRICARE and learn more here. And then again, it would be great if when you got to whatever link that was, TRICARE was expecting you. Hey, saw that you were trying to sign up for CHAMPBA, and turns out you might be eligible for TRICARE. Let's see if you're eligible for TRICARE, and then they could run you through their eligibility tool.

346
00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:55.510
Moderator: If only.

347
00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.020
P14: Yeah, I know.

348
00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:00.599
Moderator: And then, finally, Alert E.

349
00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:01.939
P14: Okay, Alert E.

350
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:18.020
P14: Yeah, you would keep going. Again, this… and I know the nuance, but the non-definitive language is what trips up a lot of people. And so, I know you can't say after an eligibility screening that you're eligible.

351
00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:29.580
P14: But it would be lovely if you could, at one day, you know, these tools could be so sharp, they could be so accurate, that, yes, you are eligible for Chant VA. Please continue your application here.

352
00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:42.099
Moderator: Gotcha. And then across all the alerts you saw, how confident do you feel that you know what to do on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being not very confident, and 5 being very confident?

353
00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:59.679
P14: I'm probably middle of the road here. Again, it's just with the non-definitive language. I think it's helpful that this is kind of pink or red, you know, that usually indicates, like, oh, an error, and this one's green. Want to note that for the people that created the color system, that's good. Yellow is kind of like a caution.

354
00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:08.260
P14: there might be some pushback here with, we can't confirm the eligibility, like, oh, is the system down? What's… you know, like, people might…

355
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:15.270
P14: keep trying to start applications because they think the system's down, you know? TRICARE goes down sometimes.

356
00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:22.000
P14: The systems go down, so people might just keep trying or applying over and over again. They're not sure, but…

357
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:24.750
P14: Again, I buy probably a 3.

358
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:32.420
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, besides that, do you have any other alerts that was confusing or unclear?

359
00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.899
P14: Hmm, nope.

360
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.380
Moderator: Alright, go ahead and scroll to the bottom.

361
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.979
Moderator: And then… Click that, back to the main…

362
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:46.410
Moderator: Prototype main menu, and then scroll down to the bottom again.

363
00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.940
Moderator: And go ahead, yup, that summary cart.

364
00:41:49.730 --> 00:42:06.399
Moderator: So, on this screen, you'll find four summary cards. The first two, Card Style A, are from the prototype we just went through, and then the third and fourth card, Card Style B, are alternative design. Please take a few moments to look at all four before we talk about them.

365
00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.480
P14: Okay.

366
00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:37.280
P14: Do you want me to start talking?

367
00:42:37.590 --> 00:42:39.880
Moderator: So I can ask the…

368
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.530
P14: Okay.

369
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:41.550
Moderator: all question,

370
00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:42.280
P14: Yep.

371
00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.559
Moderator: What do you think each car is telling you?

372
00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:54.120
P14: So in this, this one is, you may be eligible, right? Like, here, you got your two green checks.

373
00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.029
Moderator: cart, yeah.

374
00:42:55.030 --> 00:43:12.630
P14: Yep, card, style A, first card. The second one is saying you may not be eligible. However, it says the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE, but I think that's just a typo, that this is… you are eligible for TRICARE, and that's why you're not eligible for CHAMP VA. Is that correct?

375
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:17.079
Moderator: So that wording is throwing you off, or that content there is throwing you off.

376
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.139
P14: Yeah, because it's… see, it's the same sentence.

377
00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.710
P14: Here it's a yes, and here it's a no.

378
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:29.849
Moderator: And you're expecting it to basically change based on your answer.

379
00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:31.500
P14: Yeah, so if my… if I…

380
00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:31.910
Moderator: Okay.

381
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:43.299
P14: through everything, like the second example where it said, you know, we can see your veteran in DEERS, I would expect this one to say the veteran or applicant is eligible for.

382
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:48.509
Moderator: So the double negative is really… Like, throwing you off.

383
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:53.219
P14: It just doesn't make sense. How can it be a green over here, but it's a red over here? It's the same sentence.

384
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.280
Moderator: Right.

385
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:06.369
P14: And then it's the same here. I don't know why I noticed that. So, where it says here, the applicant, the veteran or applicant is eligible for TRICARE.

386
00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.849
P14: So, for me, I read this and go, you're not eligible.

387
00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:20.740
P14: with the X for CHAMP VA, and then this language is Y, because you are eligible for TRICARE. And again, it would just be great if that linked out to TRICARE, so you could get that figured out.

388
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:22.020
Moderator: Hmm.

389
00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:27.449
P14: And then on this one, It has green and green.

390
00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:32.819
P14: I would just assume I'm… yeah, I can… Sign up for it.

391
00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:34.790
P14: Which I may be eligible.

392
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:36.420
Moderator: Gotcha.

393
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:46.709
Moderator: And then I want to draw your attention to the content above the bullet point of each card. There's a slight difference between cardstyle A and card style B.

394
00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:54.340
P14: Okay, based on the veteran's information, the applicants may not be eligible. Based on the veteran's… the applicants may be eligible.

395
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:56.900
Moderator: dumb.

396
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.489
P14: Oh, your responses?

397
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.810
Moderator: Yeah.

398
00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.890
P14: Oh, above the check, your response?

399
00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.830
P14: Your responses met all the…

400
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.160
P14: Yeah, I… this sentence is helpful.

401
00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:25.720
P14: didn't meet all the eligibility requirements. So that would cause me to go, why didn't I meet all the eligibility? And then this red would be telling me, because they're eligible for TRICARE. And here's the link to TRICARE, and we're going to catch you over there and walk you through how to fix that.

402
00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:27.510
Moderator: I know they're not going to, but…

403
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:34.199
P14: That would be great. And then this one, your responsibility… your responses met all the eligibility requirements for CHAMP VA.

404
00:45:35.530 --> 00:45:36.340
Moderator: Okay.

405
00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.639
P14: That sentence is definitive. That's a good one.

406
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.020
Moderator: So, because that definitive short blurb

407
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.149
Moderator: I found that to be really helpful.

408
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:48.139
P14: Yeah, I would pick card style B over just, like, your responses.

409
00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:48.790
Moderator: Yeah.

410
00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:49.860
Moderator: So…

411
00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.539
P14: this sentence better. This is the better way to do it.

412
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:58.950
Moderator: In that case, the car style B is the easier set, or the easier set to understand, then?

413
00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:00.620
P14: Yes, definitely.

414
00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:06.410
Moderator: Gotcha. And then was there any other part of the car that felt unclear or confusing?

415
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:09.550
P14: No.

416
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:16.370
Moderator: Alright, that's it for the screen-sharing portion of the interview. I have a couple of questions left for you.

417
00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:17.090
P14: Okay.

418
00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:28.870
Moderator: You can stop, alright? And then, is there any other feedback you would like to add about the two prototype, or the messages that you saw today?

419
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:39.330
P14: No, I think the color coding is really helpful. Again, that yellow for caution, the red for no, the green, and the check marks and the X's are really helpful.

420
00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:41.020
P14: for…

421
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:49.590
P14: I mean, those kind of, keys are really helpful to kind of… quick glance, this is good. If I'm not someone who reads absolutely everything.

422
00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:56.890
P14: Those are good indicators that you're going in the right direction, or you need to get more information, or you're not eligible.

423
00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:03.890
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

424
00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:11.379
P14: I like… I mean, I saw, like, the 1 through 7 steps, if… if that was, like.

425
00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:18.269
P14: Some people, though, don't want to do that. They might go, I already know I'm eligible. Can I skip the eligibility?

426
00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:28.699
P14: I would always go through an eligibility filter myself, just to make sure I'm not wasting any time, but some people might say that's a barrier, like, I don't want to have to answer these questions, I'm just going to fill out the application.

427
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:39.280
P14: Just a note there, some people aren't going to want to do eligibility. They're very certain they do, qualify. Can I just skip the eligibility and get right to the application?

428
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:46.290
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, I think early on, you… there's a few times that mentions, TRICARE.

429
00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:55.990
Moderator: It mentions that, even if you're eligible for TRICARE, that is a disqualifying factor. Did you catch that at all, or…

430
00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:01.940
P14: Yes, and it says, it says even if you're not using it, You're eligible, so…

431
00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:19.800
P14: you're not eligible for CHAMP VA. I think there's a lot of issues there on the TRICARE side as well, so if we could just, you know, hold veterans' hands as they go between the two systems, that would be helpful. That's why I had all those notes about having a TRICARE link that could potentially capture

432
00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:26.599
P14: Or help people understand why, if they're eligible for TRICARE but not using it, what are their next steps to be able to use it?

433
00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:31.290
Moderator: Right, okay, thank you for that. And then, do you have any questions for me?

434
00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:40.669
Moderator: All right, I just want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?

435
00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:41.570
P14: Yes.

436
00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:42.470
Moderator: Alright.

437
00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:58.040
Moderator: And then just to remind you, we will remove any, any and all information that could be used to identify you before sharing the video with our VA partners, and the purpose is only for improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

438
00:48:58.820 --> 00:48:59.960
P14: Perfect, thank you.

439
00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:16.669
Moderator: And then, just want to say that we appreciate you taking your time with, to share your thoughts with us today. It'd be super helpful, I know this would be super helpful, for us to, as we continue to work to make the site better for the veterans and their family members.

440
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:26.610
Moderator: And then lastly, Pregen did send me, like, a thank you. We'll be sending you, like, a thank you note with a blurb that you can pass along to other veterans and their family member.

441
00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:32.230
Moderator: That, who would be interested in participating in, like, future research studies like this one.

442
00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:33.100
P14: Okay.

443
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.429
Moderator: And I just want to say, thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day.

444
00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.079
P14: Thank you so much, everyone.

445
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:40.140
P14: Bye now.

446
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:40.880
Moderator: Bye-bye.
