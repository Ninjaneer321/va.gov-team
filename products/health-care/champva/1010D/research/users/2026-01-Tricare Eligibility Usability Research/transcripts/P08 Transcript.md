00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
Moderator: Question, but in…

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.829
Moderator: Alright, I have started the recording, and then I'd like to confirm that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.510
P8: Yes.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:21.690
Moderator: Alright, and then are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip of our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

5
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.590
P8: Yes.

6
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:34.340
Moderator: All right, thank you. And that's the end of the boilerplates, and then we can jump right into the research study. I have a couple warm-up questions for you here.

7
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.630
Moderator: Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program for the Department of Veterans Affairs CHAMFA program?

8
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.039
P8: I don't know what that is, so no.

9
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.170
Moderator: Okay, so, have you ever heard of TRICARE?

10
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.460
P8: Yes.

11
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.089
Moderator: Okay, so you know at least one of it.

12
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:08.370
Moderator: So right now, I am gonna give you a, a link in chat that links to the prototype, and then, what I want you to do is open it in your browser, and then share the

13
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.850
Moderator: share your screen with us through Zoom here. So I'll go ahead and… I believe you're on mobile, so I'll give you the mobile version of this.

14
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.659
Moderator: And then let me know if you have any… Issues accessing it.

15
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.439
P8: You should be able to see my screen as well.

16
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.780
Moderator: Yeah, I see it, it's loading right now.

17
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.050
Moderator: Alright, so this is our main menu for our prototype here.

18
00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.600
Moderator: Yeah

19
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:20.289
Moderator: So for the start, we will go ahead and have you click into Prototype Pineapple, which is that orange button in the bottom here. So on this first page, please take a few minutes to look over, or so, to look over the instruction, and then when you're ready, in your own word, tell me what this means to you.

20
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.510
P8: Links don't work, right?

21
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.070
Moderator: And most of them don't, some of them do.

22
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:56.879
P8: Okay, it's basically stating that if you're a spouse, dependent, I don't know, what else was it? Spouse-dependent, survivor of a veteran, then you can, you might be eligible for healthcare through this program.

23
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.650
P8: If you're eligible for TRICARE, you can't get CHAMP. Okay, if you're eligible for TRICARE,

24
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.340
P8: you can't get Champa, okay? So that is a disqualifying… Factor.

25
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:15.710
P8: Nope.

26
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.250
P8: Let me do that.

27
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:45.750
P8: Okay, it seems pretty straightforward. So personnel can go ahead and apply, or see if they qualify for the… this CHAMPA…

28
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.170
P8: Insurance, I guess, through… I'm guessing it's through the VA?

29
00:03:52.350 --> 00:04:02.800
P8: And then… but you can't do it if you are eligible for TRICARE. So, is it… I'm assuming that,

30
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.799
P8: if you have TRICARE, so if you're a dependent of TRICARE, you can't double dip.

31
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.830
P8: Is what it seems like.

32
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:32.080
P8: but not specifically for… specifically for the dependent, spouse, or, other personnel, but not the veteran, because veterans should be able to get VA disability… or not VA disability, VA healthcare, which is separate from this, is what I'm assuming, and use your TRICARE.

33
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.430
P8: Yeah.

34
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.700
P8: And then application, yeah.

35
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.830
Moderator: And then, if you weren't sure whether you qualify, where on this page would you look?

36
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.330
P8: Oh, I would… I just clicked on it right here.

37
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:46.900
Moderator: I got you.

38
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.290
P8: But then it won't go further, so…

39
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.630
P8: Yeah, no, maybe this down here.

40
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.030
P8: Spouse or dependent…

41
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:07.840
P8: Or dependent child who's been permanently… veteran and permanently disabled, surviving spouse, dependent, or surviving spouse or dependent on who has the time of death.

42
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:16.509
P8: Okay, so if you do that, and you don't qualify for TRICARE, yeah.

43
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.900
P8: Okay, I guess nothing else is clickable.

44
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.140
P8: On here.

45
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.740
P8: Dependent. Okay, what questions do you have for me?

46
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.590
Moderator: Okay, you can go back by clicking that orange button up there.

47
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.970
P8: Okay.

48
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.839
Moderator: Alright, right here. Is there anything here that makes you uncertain about applying?

49
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.719
P8: Well, no. I mean, not up front, but I understand it's a…

50
00:05:50.960 --> 00:06:02.300
P8: prototype, I would like to have been able to click through everything. So, like, after I go through eligible,

51
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.970
P8: Like, being able to expand it?

52
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.769
Moderator: Do you just want to read into all this information?

53
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:28.999
P8: Yeah, for me personally, I would like to, you know, once I see… once I read this eligibility requirement, I would like to kind of go through everything to just make sure that I'm not missing anything before I go forward doing anything more or applying.

54
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.880
Moderator: I see.

55
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.290
P8: Yeah.

56
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.580
Moderator: Thank you for that feedback.

57
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.319
Moderator: And then if you go back to that page…

58
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.970
P8: Yep. Oops, shoot, hold on, I made you big.

59
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.630
P8: There we go, okay.

60
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:54.669
Moderator: Alright, and then on this page here, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly, and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

61
00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.640
P8: 5 is… what'd you say, 5 is… It's fully me.

62
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.519
Moderator: Yeah, like, in a very informed, very well informed.

63
00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:14.399
P8: Yeah, I would say 5, even though I can't click on the expanded portion, I'm assuming that's just for this prototype thing, so yeah.

64
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.369
Moderator: Okay, so you're saying, basically, there's enough information here.

65
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.880
P8: There's enough. Yeah.

66
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:28.340
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, if this is, like, a real thing, then you would want to go into all the other places to see the extra information.

67
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:29.530
P8: Correct.

68
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.580
Moderator: Alright, that makes sense to me.

69
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.130
Moderator: So, if you were doing this for real, would you continue, or would you want to review all this information first?

70
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:51.219
P8: I would like to review, but I, I mean, just based off of the idea that,

71
00:07:51.260 --> 00:08:03.409
P8: if your… if your child, like, because I have a child, if your child has… is eligible for TRICARE, because usually if you're 100% permanently, disabled.

72
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:16.529
P8: if you have the 100% rating, and then you got the technically retirement from the military, you would be eligible for TRICARE, so at that point, I wouldn't be eligible, just based off of that. I see.

73
00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.170
Moderator: self.

74
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.859
P8: Oh, no, for my… my child.

75
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.119
Moderator: Oh, okay. Oh, I got you. Because through… through you, you're saying?

76
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:34.810
P8: me, yeah, because it's saying that if… I mean, that's how I read it, that if… if your… your children or your spouse, are eligible.

77
00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.979
P8: to receive TRICARE.

78
00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:41.140
P8: Then you're not eligible for this program.

79
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:42.569
Moderator: I gotcha.

80
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:43.250
P8: Yeah.

81
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:54.320
Moderator: Okay, and then for the next task, we'll go ahead and proceed right through, so if you scroll down to the bottom, you'll see the, like, this blue area. Go ahead and click on,

82
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:56.449
Moderator: Start your form without signing in.

83
00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.580
P8: Okay, let me see, blue area… start your form…

84
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.280
Moderator: Right there.

85
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.380
P8: Oh, right there.

86
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:19.799
Moderator: So, in this prototype, we pre-fill some of the information that you normally type in if you're doing this for real. Please go through the next few questions, and remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here, and then when you're ready, you can click the continue button.

87
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.850
P8: Gotcha.

88
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.949
P8: Oh, I'm fettering the plan for my spouse, okay?

89
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:43.080
P8: Your name, date of birth, identification information. Do you want me to enter all… oh, okay, gotcha. Enter anything else that's not required?

90
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.969
Moderator: So this is a prototype, so you can't technically enter anything.

91
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:47.830
P8: Oh, okay, got it.

92
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.570
Moderator: We pre-filled everything for you here.

93
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.370
P8: Okay.

94
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:59.100
P8: Looks pretty straightforward. Oh, looks like it froze up. Hold on.

95
00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:00.810
Moderator: I paint.

96
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:02.310
Moderator: Can you scroll down?

97
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.940
P8: Nope.

98
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.260
P8: Hold on, let me back out of here.

99
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.189
Moderator: There we go, now I can. Okay.

100
00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.889
P8: Continue based on the veteran's information. Applicants may not be eligible.

101
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:22.359
P8: Okay, we found veteran information in the DoD TRICARE. Even if you aren't enrolled, you… even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for… okay.

102
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:26.030
Moderator: And I'll pause you right here for a few questions.

103
00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:31.570
Moderator: How do you feel about this applica- the way this application checked your eligibility here?

104
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:37.040
P8: It's good, I mean, it's a… a double check, right? So, like, if you…

105
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:56.889
P8: so happen to miss that, if you have TRICARE, if your spouse or dependent's already eligible for TRICARE, if you miss that portion and you wanted to apply anyway, it's a good check. So I… I do like this, this portion of it. I don't like the fact that you're not eligible, because I thought you were eligible, okay. Right. But, yeah.

106
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.659
Moderator: And then, did you feel it's helpful, intrusive, or something else?

107
00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:15.159
P8: No. It doesn't ask for any additional information, especially, like, what… if you're able to log in securely, and then you're entering your, personal identifying information here, it's not a problem.

108
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.770
Moderator: Okay. And then, do you trust that this information's accurate?

109
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.900
P8: Which information, the…

110
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.810
Moderator: this alert here.

111
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.170
P8: Yes.

112
00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.709
Moderator: And then, for yourself,

113
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.379
Moderator: If you're going through this, and then you see this message, what would you do?

114
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.010
P8: I… Stop applying.

115
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.190
P8: for it.

116
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.080
P8: I wouldn't go any further.

117
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:56.550
Moderator: Is there anything that you want to see here that if you… if you decide to stop, is there anything you want to see here?

118
00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:00.209
P8: No, because you can always do finish this application later.

119
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:07.150
Moderator: If you wanted to research a little bit more, so that's fine. That's that save button.

120
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.490
P8: Maybe a link?

121
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:28.090
P8: to something… Well, actually, am I able to click continue? Because maybe my answer would be after this, but basically, if I hit continue, and then it… would it send me to, like,

122
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:33.359
P8: I guess, more, like, reiterate the information, why I'm not eligible.

123
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:46.010
P8: Or send me to someone to… or a contact information to be able to ask additional questions of, regarding CHAMPA VA, or CHAMPA, yeah.

124
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:50.669
Moderator: So I'll just kind of revert the question to you, like, what would you like to see?

125
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.479
Moderator: In your case.

126
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.330
P8: Yeah, so if I'm able… okay, let me see… I click the continue…

127
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.110
P8: I'm just gonna… is it okay if I continue through? Because I want to see if it's…

128
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.740
P8: If my question would be answered, or is it just based off of that particular page?

129
00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:16.680
Moderator: Oh, just this particular page, I was curious, like, what would you want it to see in this situation?

130
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:28.809
P8: Yeah, so, I guess if I'm not eligible for this, a link that'll bring me back to, the criteria again.

131
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:41.989
P8: And I guess that main page, which has the criteria, and then that has a contact information on the bottom, should I have any questions regarding why I was not eligible.

132
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:47.740
Moderator: I see, so you want a way to contact and then ask, potentially ask questions if needed?

133
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:53.899
P8: Yeah, or bring me back to the original page, because that original page on the bottom, I believe, had contact information.

134
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:54.570
Moderator: Okay.

135
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.340
P8: Yeah.

136
00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:04.429
Moderator: And then, if you believe that this, system check here was wrong, and you're actually not eligible for TRICARE, what would you do?

137
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:09.530
P8: if I'm not eligible for TRICARE,

138
00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:24.530
P8: then I would, hopefully, if they had that link, I would, go to… get reverted back to there to be able to find that contact information to, see who I need to reach out to, or which department I need to reach out to.

139
00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.760
P8: I see. Yeah.

140
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:35.780
Moderator: And then, would you consider going… continuing the application, as well, or do you… would you stop right there and then go through.

141
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.260
P8: Oh, no.

142
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:56.349
P8: I guess I would… let's see, I mean, if it lets me continue, because I can save it at any point, right? So if it lets me continue, I'll keep on continuing, and then I'll pause where I need to, if I really believe that I didn't qualify. So for some… if I… if I didn't have TRICARE,

143
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.430
P8: And it, and this…

144
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:16.869
P8: information was incorrect, I would continue on with the application, I would save it to finish the application later, and then I would, go to contact information to try and figure out exactly what's going on and why. The system is saying that I'm rejected from this particular program.

145
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:25.730
Moderator: I see. Thank you for that. And then, does this feel like the system is helping you understand your option, or the system is blocking you from applying?

146
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:37.180
P8: Mmm… I can see it both ways. For me, personally, because I know that, I wouldn't qualify, and if I knew…

147
00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:48.939
P8: off the top of my head, based off of that first thing regarding, you know, if you have TRICARE, you're not eligible, or if you're authorized TRICARE, you're not eligible. I know already that I wouldn't

148
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:56.460
P8: I wouldn't qualify, but if I wasn't, and I saw this, I would feel like… I can feel like it's, blocking.

149
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.360
P8: As well.

150
00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.210
Moderator: I see.

151
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:00.010
P8: Yeah.

152
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.489
Moderator: Okay, thank you for that, and then we can continue.

153
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:04.360
P8: Okay.

154
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.510
P8: Oh, okay, doesn't, okay.

155
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.920
P8: I like that link that was there, this one right here. Check your eligibility.

156
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:37.470
P8: for TRICARE, and then check your eligibility. So, I mean, click this one, so at least it takes you to another link. When it takes you to another link, does it kick you out of this one?

157
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.000
Moderator: So, technically,

158
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.710
P8: It just opens up another tab, right?

159
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:43.260
Moderator: Yeah.

160
00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.629
P8: Yeah, okay, so it just opens up another tab so you can come back, so that's good.

161
00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:56.520
P8: Eligibility, CHAMPA, based on the veteran's information, may not be eligible. Veterans permanently… Okay.

162
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.150
P8: Did I meet a little different?

163
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.390
P8: Exit this application… okay.

164
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:17.150
Moderator: And then I'll pause right here. In your own word, can you tell me what this page means?

165
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:30.129
P8: So, this one basically goes over what the requirements are, what requirements you meet, and what requirements you don't meet, and then,

166
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:42.880
P8: if you… you can always save your application, or you can exit the application, because you no longer qualify, because you have that applicant is not eligible… veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

167
00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:51.550
Moderator: And then, just to make sure I understand… understood you correctly, if you're eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMP VA?

168
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.070
P8: No.

169
00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:59.100
Moderator: Okay, and then what is… what do the icons and checkmark means to you?

170
00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:24.310
P8: So that… so the check mark means that this is what allows me to qualify for CHAMPVA. The X means that I, am not eligible because of this particular requirement, but I don't like the verbiage here because, this… this one, the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE. So how this is stated to me sounds like the veteran or applicant isn't eligible

171
00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.379
P8: for TRICARE, not CHAMPA.

172
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:32.300
P8: isn't eligible for a CHAMP VA based off of TRICARE.

173
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.109
Moderator: I gotcha. So you want it to be worded differently.

174
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.940
P8: Yeah.

175
00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:38.899
Moderator: It's slightly awkward or confusing to you.

176
00:18:40.450 --> 00:19:00.039
P8: I mean, I understand it, I understand why, but then I can see how it could be interpreted another way. Because if I were quickly reading through it, and I saw veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE, I'm like, yeah, I'm not eligible for TRICARE, or I am eligible for TRICARE, so why are they putting an X there? Right, yeah.

177
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:07.109
Moderator: And then, based on your understanding of this page, do you think you're eligible for CHAMPVA? Or CHAMPA?

178
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:08.599
P8: No, I'm not.

179
00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.630
Moderator: Okay, and then how confident are you in that understanding?

180
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:16.309
P8: Mmm, like, 100%, or I guess 99.9999%.

181
00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.020
P8: Maybe it'll change, I don't know.

182
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:18.410
Moderator: Okay.

183
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:19.640
P8: But…

184
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.410
Moderator: then…

185
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.640
P8: I do have a question, though, just because I…

186
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:33.009
P8: I didn't… I wasn't… I didn't click through everything, or it wasn't, it wasn't eligible, but, so…

187
00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:46.720
P8: just because someone who has, you may not be eligible now. So, for instance, a child, right? A dependent of a veteran who is totally permanent, disabled,

188
00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:52.560
P8: does that… will they be… or I guess they…

189
00:19:52.680 --> 00:20:03.939
P8: would they be eligible for this program once they age out of TRICARE? That's what I… I don't… I would like to read more about.

190
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:14.770
P8: that type of thing. And then if there was one regarding, there probably is, but, on kids with special…

191
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.899
P8: needs… if they're not eligible for TRICARE.

192
00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:23.210
P8: I just don't know enough about

193
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:25.570
P8: Once they age out, that's why.

194
00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:33.030
Moderator: I gotcha. And then would it be helpful to have that information in the… that kind of, that first portion of the.

195
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:34.480
P8: Yeah, yup.

196
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:35.480
Moderator: Okay.

197
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:35.970
P8: Yep.

198
00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:38.229
Moderator: Noted. Thank you for that feedback.

199
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:49.469
Moderator: So, based on… If… oh, what would you do next if you were really applying today?

200
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:51.700
P8: I would exit the application.

201
00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.740
Moderator: Okay. Yeah. Just because you're, like, it doesn't really apply to you anymore.

202
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:57.320
P8: Yeah.

203
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:00.060
Moderator: And then…

204
00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:11.609
Moderator: On a scale on this page here, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this screen?

205
00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:22.339
P8: I would give it a 4, just because of the verbiage that I didn't, like, with the… the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

206
00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.300
Moderator: Gotcha.

207
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:31.170
Moderator: Thank you for that, and then you can go ahead and press continue. Okay. It'll take you back to the beginning here. Okay.

208
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.249
P8: Oh, come on.

209
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:41.140
Moderator: We just did pine… We just did prototype pineapple, and then we'll switch over and do the second prototype, which is, prototype blueberry.

210
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.610
P8: Go ahead and click into that. Yup.

211
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:52.199
Moderator: So this is the same introduction page as before. You can go ahead and scroll down to the bottom, and click, sign in.

212
00:21:53.210 --> 00:22:08.249
Moderator: And then, very similar to the previous prototype, where you proceed through these questions, and then please go through these questions and kind of think out loud as much as possible. Again, we just want to hear your thoughts as you're reading through this content and information.

213
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:11.409
P8: Okay… virtualize you…

214
00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:31.940
P8: Oh, probably what I didn't see on the other one, but what I like about how it's presented here, it's, it's separated, so it makes it easy for, a veteran or somebody to read. It's not all lumped together in one big paragraph, it's kind of chunked. That's good.

215
00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.650
P8: Use the veteran's information, you won't need to upload DD214.

216
00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:44.320
P8: You must meet all eligibility requirements, if you're not eligible. Okay, continue? Yeah, go ahead.

217
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:58.970
P8: Okay, this is pretty straightforward as well. Same as the other one.

218
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:02.250
P8: Okay.

219
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:08.370
P8: 8.

220
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:22.960
P8: I like this page, it's, you don't require, just like the other one, you don't require a lot of information, and too much scrolling. It's pretty much right there, so you can fill it out and then continue to the next page.

221
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:33.509
P8: kind of chunking it like that makes it a little bit easier to digest. Your service-connected disability, does that. It is required, so that's good.

222
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.880
P8: I like that required is in red.

223
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:48.020
P8: Because it makes it easy to spot. Eligibility for TRICARE, are you, or any eligible, eligible for TRICARE? Okay, so this one, they said no, okay.

224
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.190
P8: So we'll see how this goes on this one.

225
00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:53.960
P8: Okay.

226
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:02.600
P8: Okay… You may be eligible, okay?

227
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.419
P8: Again, I like how it's presented here,

228
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:25.000
P8: when I see two check marks, I'm assuming I'm a go. Again, same with that verbiage, veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE, but it… that one did…

229
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:38.520
P8: Are you eligible for TRICARE? So that… so if… when I go back, it says, like, this one, I think, makes more sense, because it says, are you or any, applicants eligible

230
00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:44.499
P8: or enrolled in TRICARE, and I put no. So, because I put no here, it says…

231
00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:53.510
P8: veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE. So that over here makes sense. Whereas the previous one, when I had clicked I was eligible.

232
00:24:53.510 --> 00:25:07.430
P8: that I do receive TRICARE, it stated this particular statement here, so that's why I think it can be different, but for here, when they click no, and it says veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE, that makes sense.

233
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:08.210
Moderator: I see.

234
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:21.290
P8: Yeah, so this verbiage for this particular application where they are not eligible makes sense to me, so I like… the verbiage here is fine for me. Met eligibility requirements, I would continue.

235
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:22.180
Moderator: Okay.

236
00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:22.700
P8: Yeah.

237
00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:32.580
Moderator: And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this second prototype?

238
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.110
P8: 5.

239
00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:40.470
Moderator: Okay, and then comparing the two prototypes, which, which would you prefer to use?

240
00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:50.579
P8: Honestly didn't have any preference. It was mainly the one thing that really,

241
00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.710
P8: I guess, stood out to me was just…

242
00:25:54.860 --> 00:26:05.630
P8: honestly, I'm a stickler for verbiage, so just this particular, part down here, was confusing on the other application, just because of the…

243
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.309
P8: The box that was checked on the page previous.

244
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.710
Moderator: Gotcha.

245
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:15.799
P8: Previously, yeah, but, they both seem pretty…

246
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:20.360
P8: Pretty easy to use, and I honestly can't really tell the difference.

247
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:23.129
P8: Between the two, yeah.

248
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:28.760
Moderator: And then it sounds like your… your issue is really that double negative that's confusing.

249
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:30.210
P8: Yeah.

250
00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.740
P8: On the other application, but this one makes sense, yeah.

251
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:44.360
Moderator: Yeah, that makes sense. And then, thinking about everything you just saw, was there too much information, too little, or about the right amount of information?

252
00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:54.010
P8: I think about the right amount, because if you needed to, you had links to be able to expand and go back to refer, so I think that's fine, yeah.

253
00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:58.849
Moderator: And then, if you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident in doing so?

254
00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:00.550
P8: Yes.

255
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.830
Moderator: Okay, thank you for that, and then you can go ahead and press continue.

256
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:06.490
P8: Okay.

257
00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:21.129
Moderator: So, you finished the two prototype, we do have a couple of other things for you to look at here. Yeah, if you scroll down, there's two types of, kind of messages. Yep. Go ahead and click on the first one, which is the warning alert. Yeah.

258
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:25.010
Moderator: So for this one, this is,

259
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:37.369
Moderator: when you go through their prototype, and you type in your name, the veteran's name, in this case, your name, you see these, warning label pop up, and then I'll read you a few different scenarios, and then, like,

260
00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:47.330
Moderator: Please state any questions that you may have, or feedback that you could provide. Okay. On the Alert A, in this scenario, you enter your name, your information.

261
00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:57.429
Moderator: And then you see the following message. Please think out loud on your thoughts on around… about this, alert… what this alert means, and explain what action you would do.

262
00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.490
Moderator: We would take in this scenario?

263
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:15.530
P8: Okay, so if I… first, what I would do would… I would do what it says and check the information that I entered, make sure I entered everything correctly, birthdate, social security number, veteran's information,

264
00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:25.490
P8: second, if this… if it still pops up, and I didn't do that, I would actually,

265
00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:34.460
P8: go to contact information and try and reach out to somebody, or schedule an appointment through the VA to make sure that I was,

266
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:42.080
P8: registered in the system, in the VA system to be able to do that, and then, actually

267
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:54.059
P8: at that scheduled appointment, I would kind of go through this particular process, let them know what I'm trying to do here for CHAMPA, or I keep calling it CHAMPA, CHAMPVA,

268
00:28:54.510 --> 00:29:07.609
P8: I would let them know what I was trying to do with, applying for a CHAMP VA, and that they can't find me in the system. And then, I don't know, I guess, from there would determine whether or not it is a… I don't know…

269
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:26.619
P8: error in the system, or if it's in… if it's something with the website. If there was something with the website, I'm pretty sure you guys would have some sort of banner that comes across. Like, we've had… we're having issues regarding, you know, with, information, try again later, or something like that.

270
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:28.590
P8: But, yeah, that's what I would do.

271
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:39.920
Moderator: And then, in this scenario, even after seeing this message, and then if it's possible for you to continue, would you want to apply for CHAMP VA benefits?

272
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.980
Moderator: Despite this warning?

273
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.609
P8: Yes, as long as I can save my work. If I can't save anything, then there's no sense of…

274
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.810
P8: Continuing on. How long does it save for?

275
00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.419
Moderator: I think…

276
00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:57.970
P8: 30 days.

277
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:02.280
Moderator: I think way more than that. I can't remember on the top of my head, but it's way more than that.

278
00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:21.040
P8: Okay, that's good. Yeah, so as long as it can save, I would continue on with the system, because if it is something that is, maybe, like, a bug with the, I don't know, the website or something, at least it can, you know, I would have not wasted my time in filling something out, so yeah.

279
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.360
Moderator: That makes sense.

280
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:29.319
Moderator: And then go ahead and go to, alert B. Same situation, you enter your name, and now you're seeing this message.

281
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:36.229
P8: Hmm, okay. You can try again later, or select continue to complete your application. Okay.

282
00:30:38.290 --> 00:30:43.420
Moderator: so, for this, would you… what would you do in this case?

283
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:46.290
P8: Oh, I'd still continue my application.

284
00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:53.390
P8: Yeah, I'd continue, yeah, I'd continue my application. Well, first, I would double check, again, double check what I entered, right?

285
00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:53.820
Moderator: Right.

286
00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:04.349
P8: Because if I'm entering something incorrectly, it wouldn't complete anyway, so I, would double-check that, then I would continue my application, and then see if this… if I still get this,

287
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:22.719
P8: this message, which I probably will, then I'll do the same protocol that I did before, reach out to the contact information provided, whether it be email or a phone number, wait for information back, then schedule, you know, if I could, schedule an appointment with the,

288
00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.889
P8: probably the VA that… I can't even…

289
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:35.540
P8: the eligibility office area, schedule an appointment there to go down and then let them know exactly what's going on. So, pretty much the same things, yeah.

290
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:38.860
Moderator: And then we can go ahead and move to Alert C.

291
00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:39.550
P8: Okay.

292
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:45.170
Moderator: And then you'll see the following alert in Alert C, or in this, in this scenario here.

293
00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:50.510
P8: Okay.

294
00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.480
P8: Yeah, I would do exactly the same thing that I would do for Alert B, yeah.

295
00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:04.680
P8: Although I like Alert B's message a little bit better, but yeah.

296
00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.059
Moderator: Can you, elaborate on that?

297
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:26.100
P8: Yeah, it's cleaner, it's shorter, and straight to the point, so, it has the link for you to continue, right? You can try again later, or select continue, and then, so I would do that. But this one, we can't confirm the eligibility right now. Same thing that this says before. If you think it's an error, check the information, which is kind of what

298
00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:27.410
P8: you know.

299
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:41.059
P8: I don't know what a… what somebody I would hope they would do in the first place, or select… I guess I don't like the… or select continue to complete your application.

300
00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:42.940
P8: Yeah.

301
00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.230
P8: I'm on a call, Dil!

302
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.480
P8: Saying.

303
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:52.779
Moderator: It's okay. And then, can you scroll down to, Alert D?

304
00:32:52.840 --> 00:33:04.160
P8: Same situation, you see this? Yep, based on the veteran's information, the applicant may not be eligible. Okay, we found the veteran's information on the… on DEERS for TRICARE benefits.

305
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:17.929
P8: Even if you aren't enrolled, you… even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for job because you're eligible for… okay, we found the veteran's information on… in DEERS, okay? Even if you aren't enrolled.

306
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.910
P8: You aren't eligible for CHAMPA.

307
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:26.599
P8: If you are eligible for that.

308
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:36.890
P8: Even if you aren't enrolled. Okay, I guess that makes sense. Even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHAMPA benefits, if you're eligible.

309
00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:54.179
P8: I get what it's saying, but I can… I have to kind of slow down to kind of digest it a little bit. So even if you aren't enrolled in DEERS, that's how I perceive it, if you aren't enrolled in DEERS, you aren't eligible for CHAMPA because you're eligible for TRICARE.

310
00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:58.309
P8: I don't know if there's a way to wordsmith it so it's not as,

311
00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:03.130
P8: it seems like a lot of… I mean, I understand why it's…

312
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:06.309
P8: That way, but even if you aren't enrolled.

313
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:13.549
P8: We found veterans information on DEERS. Even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible.

314
00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:25.910
P8: Even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHAMPA, or you aren't eligible for CHAMP VA benefits.

315
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:31.850
P8: Okay.

316
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:40.130
P8: Yeah, I just… the wording is a little off for me here. I think there's,

317
00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:44.300
P8: I understand what it's saying, but I think,

318
00:34:44.739 --> 00:35:00.960
P8: maybe too many thoughts in one sentence. Sorry, I… I'm in this… this way because I'm correcting my kids' homework all the time and stuff like that, but, like, so even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHAMPA,

319
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.860
P8: Benefits, if you are

320
00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:17.720
P8: eligible for TRICARE. I guess that if you are eligible for TRICARE, I feel like it's, like, it should be, like, something due to being eligible for TRICARE, or something like that. So,

321
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.810
P8: By using the word if, it's like…

322
00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.320
P8: I don't know, it doesn't seem as…

323
00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.200
P8: as solid as a… like, if you're… it…

324
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:35.189
P8: you know, like, somebody reading it really quick could be like, oh, wait, if I'm eligible? So they'll have to read it again. It's just… if they can work.

325
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:36.590
Moderator: The logic flow of it.

326
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.170
P8: Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

327
00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:44.780
Moderator: Yeah, the wordsmithing, as you mentioned. I gotcha. And then, if you see this message, what would you do?

328
00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:52.940
P8: For this one, Bisa… there's, if I had to continue.

329
00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:58.219
P8: Well, actually, no, because if I'm not… if I knew that I wasn't…

330
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:07.259
P8: eligible in the first place. Yeah. I wouldn't continue, but if I… I… even if I…

331
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:10.519
P8: If I was… if I…

332
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:15.840
P8: I would still try and continue, even if I'm…

333
00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:22.989
P8: wait, hold on, let me think. So, if I was… if I knew that,

334
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:31.169
P8: I received TRIC… if I'm receiving TRICARE already, I wouldn't continue. If I'm not receiving TRICARE already, I would still…

335
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:43.049
P8: I might not continue if my kid is… is found in DEERS, unless that wasn't… unless some…

336
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:54.240
P8: for some reason, that was an accident. So then I would go back to… if it was an accident, and they aren't enrolled in DEERS, I don't know what scenario it would be that they wouldn't be enrolled in DEERS.

337
00:36:54.260 --> 00:37:07.620
P8: But then I would go back and check with DEERS to make sure all that information is correct, and then continue. So maybe I would just save my application at this point, but I wouldn't continue.

338
00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:08.330
Moderator: I got it.

339
00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:08.960
P8: Yeah.

340
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.419
Moderator: And then go ahead and go to Alert E.

341
00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.720
Moderator: Same thing.

342
00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.729
P8: Okay, I would continue.

343
00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.840
Moderator: Okay, straightforward enough. Yeah, go ahead and…

344
00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:27.060
P8: I like the color coding. I like the color coding. Here, the… I mean, this is what VA uses anyway, the…

345
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.410
Moderator: Right.

346
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:31.410
P8: Green amber, red, yeah. Back to prototype, is that where I clicked?

347
00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:46.179
Moderator: Yes, go ahead and click back to the prototype. Okay. And then… I'm sorry, apology right here. On all of the cards that you saw for the warning messages, how confident did you feel you know what to do on a scale of 1 to 5?

348
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:47.330
P8: Life.

349
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:53.590
Moderator: 5. Pretty confident in them. Yeah. Were there any alerts that was confusing or unclear to you?

350
00:37:53.590 --> 00:38:03.379
P8: just that one that I mentioned, just the… it wasn't unclear, but I think it could have been stated, that last sentence could have been, stated a little bit differently.

351
00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.959
Moderator: It's the wordsmithing of it.

352
00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:05.540
P8: Yeah.

353
00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:27.719
Moderator: Okay, that makes sense. Alright, go ahead and click on the summary card here. So this is the final task. In the screen, you'll find four summary cards. The first two, card style A, are from the prototypes we just went through, and then the third and fourth card, card style B, are alternative design. Please take a few moments to look at all four, and then we'll talk about them.

354
00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:31.079
P8: Okay. Do you want me to think out loud as well?

355
00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:31.790
Moderator: Yeah, yes, please.

356
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.189
P8: Okay.

357
00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:45.039
P8: Veteran… okay. I like the check marks, makes it easy to kind of connect the different,

358
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:49.699
P8: you know, see the different bullet points, I guess.

359
00:38:50.410 --> 00:39:01.090
P8: A veteran is permanently or totally disabled from service-connected, died from a service-connected disability. Veteran at the time of their death was permanently disabled. Okay, veteran or applicant is not eligible. Are you okay?

360
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:16.560
P8: Okay, sorry, he was breathing weird. Okay, based on the veteran's information, application may not be eligible. Okay, your response is, veteran is not, okay, the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

361
00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:24.739
P8: This, again, I think we talked about this one before, the veteran or applicant, yeah, so that's the only thing that I don't like there.

362
00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.380
Moderator: double negative.

363
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.679
P8: Yeah, yep.

364
00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.260
P8: Because then a veteran is not…

365
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:35.230
P8: is not eligible for TRICARE, so if I'm not eligible.

366
00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:54.440
P8: because how I read it, how I read it, just initially, is if I'm not… veteran is not eligible for TRICARE. Yeah, I'm not eligible for TRICARE, so why am I not getting CHAMP VA? Yeah, that's how I would read it. Okay, CarSalBe, based on the information, may be eligible…

367
00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.310
P8: Okay…

368
00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:09.260
P8: Veteran is not… yup, I like this one. Veteran is not eligible for TRICARE, which makes sense, right, for that one. Based on information, may not be eligible.

369
00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:15.380
P8: Hold on.

370
00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:20.009
P8: Sorry, hold on one second, starter.

371
00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.230
P8: It'd still be… Oh, did I scroll down too?

372
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:25.980
P8: I guess I did, okay.

373
00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:31.729
P8: Carcell be… obesity may not be eligible.

374
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:37.690
P8: Didn't meet all the… okay, requirements. Oh, I like that.

375
00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.620
P8: Submit all the requirements.

376
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.980
P8: Sorry, I just want to double-check one… may be eligible…

377
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:57.209
P8: I like this message where, this one right here, where it says, based on the veteran's information, applicants may not be eligible,

378
00:40:57.530 --> 00:41:04.770
P8: And then, where it says, your responses didn't meet all the eligibility requirements. I like that statement right there, that's good.

379
00:41:09.350 --> 00:41:12.870
P8: The veteran or applicant is eligible for TRICARE.

380
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:15.130
P8: Yeah, that's better.

381
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.510
P8: Yes, yeah.

382
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:20.870
Moderator: So, what do you think each car is telling you?

383
00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.840
P8: Basically, the summary of

384
00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:38.879
P8: whether I qualified or I didn't. It makes it pretty easy to… to see. I like how it's all set up. The check marks mean that is what qualifies you. The X's are what disqualifies you.

385
00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.580
Moderator: And then which set is the easiest to understand at a glance?

386
00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.910
P8: Let me see…

387
00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:08.290
P8: I like… the last, cardstyle B,

388
00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:19.600
P8: Where it says responses are either you met all eligibility requirements, or… so it just kind of helps summarize it a little bit more.

389
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:29.079
P8: And then just really just plainly states out there, yes, you qualified, or yes, you didn't, or yes, you qualified, or no, you didn't, and these are the reasons why.

390
00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:36.970
Moderator: Okay. And then, besides that double negative part, was there any other part of the card that felt unclear or confusing to you?

391
00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:37.950
P8: No.

392
00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:38.820
P8: Nope.

393
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:40.050
Moderator: Alright.

394
00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:48.059
Moderator: And that is it for the prototype portion. You can stop screen sharing if you.

395
00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:49.180
P8: Okay.

396
00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:53.649
Moderator: Alright, I do have a few additional questions for you here.

397
00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:01.860
Moderator: Before we end the call, are there any other feedback you would like to add about the two prototype order messages that you saw today?

398
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:03.680
P8: No.

399
00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:10.980
Moderator: And then, do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

400
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:30.610
P8: No, I mean, I think VA, in general makes it pretty easy. It looks like a standard, standard, thing that you would see on any of the, like, the VA website to click, and everything. The links make it easy. I don't know, it…

401
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:37.060
P8: Seems pretty straightforward, yeah. But I don't know… For, okay, so…

402
00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:48.299
P8: I always wonder about those veterans that are, in a different generation, right? How sometimes they struggle with

403
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:56.880
P8: like, my parents and stuff, for instance, you know, like, they struggle a lot with… with the computer and everything like that. So,

404
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:06.920
P8: I still think, it may be okay for them,

405
00:44:07.740 --> 00:44:15.019
P8: I know sometimes, like, just think… just knowing my parents themselves, like, if they see too many links.

406
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.830
P8: It can get…

407
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:31.839
P8: overly confusing, but where you have those drop-down boxes where you can either open up the… open up the drop-down to click a link, I think those are… those are good. So you like those? I do, I do. Yeah,

408
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:47.570
P8: yeah, I like those. I think those would be… make it a little bit easier and cleaner, so that it doesn't make the page as long, and it kind of compresses it, so that, a veteran, whether or not they're computer savvy or phone savvy or not, they can still be able to,
