00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.630
Moderator: I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm if you're comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.190
P11: Yep.

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:20.750
Moderator: Okay, and then, are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that could be used to identify you?

4
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.760
P11: Yes.

5
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:34.580
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then we have a couple of warm-up questions for you. Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the CHAMPA program?

6
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.800
P11: No.

7
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.639
Moderator: Alright, and then, have you ever heard of the CHAMPA program before?

8
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.610
P11: No.

9
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.460
Moderator: Have you ever heard of TRICARE?

10
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.380
P11: Yes.

11
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.050
Moderator: Can you explain, what TRICARE is in your own words?

12
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.779
P11: It's an insurance that they offer to veterans and families.

13
00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:07.670
Moderator: Okay, all right, so we're gonna jump right into the prototyping portion here. I'm gonna share a link in chat with you of the prototype, and then I'd like you to open it in your browser and share your Zoom screen.

14
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.099
Moderator: I'd like to confirm that you are on either a laptop, or are you on a mobile device?

15
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.510
P11: A laptop?

16
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.730
Moderator: A laptop, okay, so I have…

17
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.039
Moderator: A desktop version for you here that you can… Click on.

18
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.350
Moderator: So, I've had…

19
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.519
P11: Post it, or pasted the…

20
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.020
Moderator: Prototype in chat.

21
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.729
Moderator: Then let me know if you need, assistant in doing this.

22
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.740
Moderator: It takes a little bit of time to load.

23
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.730
P11: Yeah, it's like…

24
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.650
Moderator: And once it's loaded, please share your, your screen.

25
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:24.089
Moderator: I see your screen. Are you good to go? I think you can do the exit on, press the close on the sign-in for…

26
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.810
Moderator: to Figma with Google, so you can get a little bit more surface area there.

27
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.209
P11: Is this common?

28
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.249
Moderator: The little pop-up window of… yeah.

29
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.859
Moderator: Alright. So…

30
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:53.309
Moderator: So what we'll do first is that, you can see two buttons on the screen there. The prototype blueberry and then Prototype pineapple. We'll start with, prototype blueberry. So go ahead and click on that blue button.

31
00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:03.070
Moderator: On this first page here, please take a few, a minute or so to look over the instruction, and when you're ready, in your own word, tell me what this means to you.

32
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.750
P11: That looks like an application.

33
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.040
P11: For health insurance?

34
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.719
Moderator: Okay, and then who is eligible to apply?

35
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.490
P11: Oh, boy.

36
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.549
P11: This, the spouse, dependents, and survivors?

37
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.649
Moderator: And then, do you see any reason why you might not be eligible?

38
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.810
P11: If you applied for TRICAN.

39
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.050
Moderator: Okay? And then if you weren't sure whether you qualify, where on this page would you look?

40
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.199
P11: Check your eligibility.

41
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.870
Moderator: Alrighty. And then…

42
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:49.980
Moderator: So it says, I wanted to draw your attention to step one right there, and then there's a sentence that says, we'll also help you check your eligibility when you complete this form. What's your expectation, if any, when you read this sentence?

43
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.669
P11: That, in case you're still not sure, there's a second, step to check if you qualify.

44
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.010
Moderator: Okay, and then is there anything here that makes you uncertain about applying?

45
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.749
P11: I guess if they don't explain what makes you qualify for Camp VA?

46
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.889
Moderator: So, if you wanted to apply today, would you continue, or would you want more information first?

47
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.590
P11: Probably… if they had listed what makes you eligible on the side, and then you could see…

48
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.839
P11: If it's worth your time to apply.

49
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.449
Moderator: Gotcha. So you want more information, essentially.

50
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.850
P11: Like, maybe, like, a link saying, like, what qual… like, what are the qualifications?

51
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.370
Moderator: I see.

52
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:57.200
Moderator: And then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly, and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

53
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.030
P11: I feel like it's a 4. Tells you what you're applying for.

54
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.310
P11: And then, like, how the steps are supposed to follow by the guide… the 1, 2, 3 steps.

55
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.020
P11: Right. Yeah.

56
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.239
Moderator: And then, what would make it a 5 in your eyes?

57
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:29.100
P11: Just, like, a little bit more explanation for the form. I mean, the CHAMP VA itself.

58
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.600
Moderator: I gotcha.

59
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:38.890
Moderator: Alrighty, and then, if you scroll down to the bottom there, there's another blue… Screen.

60
00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.530
Moderator: And then, yeah, that one, and then in the Start Your Own form without signing in, go ahead and press on that.

61
00:06:48.060 --> 00:07:07.179
Moderator: So, in this, in this prototype, we pre-fill all the information you would normally type in if you're doing this for real. Please go through the next few questions, and remember to kind of think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here, and then you can click continue when you're ready.

62
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.690
Moderator: To proceed to the next page.

63
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.289
P11: Alright, so the second page will show you the eligibility.

64
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.510
P11: Or it makes it clear, or like, you can see if you're eligible. We use veteran information.

65
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.160
P11: Okay.

66
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.080
Moderator: No issues so far?

67
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.809
P11: It doesn't really explain what, what makes you eligible?

68
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.110
P11: Right?

69
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:49.589
Moderator: So, okay, so you want… you still want more information on that, is that correct?

70
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:50.920
Moderator: Alright.

71
00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:01.350
P11: And the spouse… Inc.

72
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.020
P11: I like that they started with the veterans, because…

73
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.229
P11: Some people put their own information in first.

74
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:25.839
Moderator: Okay, so that's clear to you that the veteran's name needs to be here.

75
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.610
P11: Maybe they make Veteran's name bigger, too?

76
00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.250
P11: This is… Very simple.

77
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.010
Moderator: Okay.

78
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.750
P11: Or understandable.

79
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.290
P11: The veteran diagnostician.

80
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.760
P11: Or I like that they keep the questions simple, or not too many on one page.

81
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.089
Moderator: Any thoughts here?

82
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.779
P11: Oh no, cause… no? I think it's,

83
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:24.360
P11: I like that it has a little pop-up.

84
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:25.860
P11: Also.

85
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.410
P11: And you can check your eligibility.

86
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.230
P11: Richard.

87
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.529
Moderator: Let me know when you're finished reviewing this, because I have a few questions for you here.

88
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:52.090
P11: Okay.

89
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.909
Moderator: So in your own word, can you tell me what this page means?

90
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.189
P11: The veteran is not eligible for TRICARE.

91
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:10.690
Moderator: Just to make sure I understand you correctly, if you're eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMFA?

92
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.190
P11: No.

93
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:13.360
Moderator: I mean, yes.

94
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:15.979
Moderator: Oh, so you think, okay.

95
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.150
P11: Right, because the first page said, if you're eligible for TRICARE, you're not.

96
00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.570
P11: eligible for CHAMP VA.

97
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:28.959
Moderator: If, you're doing this for real and you're not sure, what would you do?

98
00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:32.850
P11: Probably…

99
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.210
P11: I'll still probably continue.

100
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:47.490
Moderator: Okay, and then in this page here, what do the icons or the green checkmark means to you?

101
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.880
P11: It looks like it was, correct.

102
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.270
P11: When I see it.

103
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.290
Moderator: And then, what do you think the system is telling you about your eligibility?

104
00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.360
P11: I would assume that I was, eligible.

105
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.969
Moderator: And then, what makes you say that?

106
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.749
P11: Because it's green.

107
00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.640
Moderator: Okay.

108
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.390
Moderator: And then, how confident are you in that understanding?

109
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:17.169
P11: Not very confident. I probably… if that was a little bit more clear.

110
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.339
P11: See it, like, oh, this person is eligible, instead of just check marks.

111
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.220
Moderator: I gotcha. So you want a little bit more direct, content there.

112
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:31.250
P11: Or, like, a lot of people are, like, unfamiliar with… Break.

113
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:33.440
P11: the programs.

114
00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:38.799
Moderator: And then you mentioned that you would continue if you're doing this for real?

115
00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:48.389
Moderator: Okay, so on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this screen?

116
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:49.780
P11: the screen?

117
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.440
Moderator: Yeah.

118
00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.330
P11: Probably, like, a 2.

119
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:57.019
Moderator: A 2, okay. And then, why did you give it that rating?

120
00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:01.749
P11: Cause I think I'm eligible, but I didn't read it.

121
00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:05.950
Moderator: Okay, so you think so, but you're not quite sure, and…

122
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:12.360
Moderator: The information's not really giving you, like, a full confidence in… I gotcha.

123
00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.780
Moderator: Alright, go ahead and continue.

124
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:30.430
Moderator: So this will take you back to the beginning of the prototype here, and then for the next task, we'll move on to the second prototype. And the second prototype is the, in your case, it would be the prototype pineapple. Let's go ahead and click on that.

125
00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:35.479
Moderator: The instruction page is the same as before, so you can go ahead and scroll down.

126
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:42.309
Moderator: To the bottom, and then click the… that link, yeah, sign, start form without signing in.

127
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:57.180
Moderator: And again, it's gonna be the same thing as you did before, where you're gonna go through the next few questions, and remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here, and click continue when you're ready.

128
00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:58.140
P11: Okay.

129
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.920
P11: Okay, similar to the last one.

130
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.580
P11: Okay.

131
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.800
P11: Perfect response.

132
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:35.719
P11: Did I click something?

133
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:43.250
Moderator: Yeah, so, I'll pause you right here. How do you feel about the way this application checks your eligibility here?

134
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:51.100
P11: It'll probably stop you from… Continuing further.

135
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.430
Moderator: And then, did it help, did it…

136
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.099
Moderator: Did it feel helpful, intrusive, or something else?

137
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.869
P11: No, I don't think it's intrusive, I just feel like it.

138
00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:08.690
P11: just… ugh.

139
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:09.920
Moderator: It's just awful.

140
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.540
P11: right away.

141
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:15.359
P11: We found your information,

142
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:21.319
P11: you are eligible for CHAMP VA, or it tells you right up front, without you going further.

143
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.150
Moderator: And then, did you find that helpful, intrusive, or…

144
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.349
Moderator: You're… and then you're saying it's off? Can you elaborate on that?

145
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.669
P11: I mean, I feel like they should explain why they're not.

146
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.060
Moderator: Okay, so you…

147
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.150
Moderator: More information there.

148
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.280
P11: Maybe, like, a chat service? I don't know.

149
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.859
Moderator: Okay, so you… maybe a way to contact the VA here?

150
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.000
Moderator: And then, do you trust that this information is accurate, then?

151
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.219
P11: No, because maybe it's a special case, or…

152
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.170
Moderator: So after seeing this message, what would you do?

153
00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:00.770
P11: Probably contact.

154
00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:02.920
P11: Somebody in person.

155
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.969
Moderator: Okay, so you wanna… Yeah, so you want to call or contact someone.

156
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:14.280
Moderator: So… Would you like to see here, then?

157
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:22.369
P11: Oh… Probably, like, another form, maybe to,

158
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.930
P11: Ask for another person's opinion, whether you're eligible or not.

159
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.170
Moderator: Okay.

160
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:28.490
P11: Yeah.

161
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.850
Moderator: I gotcha. So, essentially some kind of contact, form.

162
00:15:35.410 --> 00:15:38.659
Moderator: Let's see… sorry, I slightly lost my place here.

163
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:46.529
Moderator: So, if you believe this check was wrong, and you're actually not eligible for TRICARE,

164
00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:51.559
Moderator: So you would… you would want to contact someone to kind of confirm that?

165
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.540
P11: Is that correct? Alright.

166
00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.349
Moderator: Then, in this case, would you continue the application anyways?

167
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:59.560
P11: iPhone.

168
00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:03.800
Moderator: Okay, and then… can you explain your reasoning around that?

169
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.100
P11: Or, in case it was raw, I still have an app.

170
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.240
Moderator: I gotcha.

171
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:17.769
Moderator: And then, does this feel like the system is helping you understand your option, or is the system blocking you from applying?

172
00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:19.789
P11: It kind of feels like they're blocking.

173
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.670
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, why do you feel that?

174
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.269
P11: Because it's not… it doesn't explode.

175
00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.170
Moderator: Alright, so it's the lack of information here.

176
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.340
P11: Gotcha.

177
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.950
Moderator: Thank you for that, and then you can continue.

178
00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:45.730
P11: Hmm?

179
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:05.229
P11: Okay, now it makes sense. So, now it looks like I'm not eligible, because there's no reds.

180
00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.300
P11: Red X.

181
00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:15.779
Moderator: I gotcha. So, would you take the same action, or a different action compared to the previous prototype?

182
00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:20.300
P11: I'll probably stop it, exit the application, and then call somebody directly.

183
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:26.250
Moderator: Gotcha. So you… you want to stop the application, and then contact, essentially, the VA in this case.

184
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:39.959
Moderator: So here, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand the second prototype of the form?

185
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.449
P11: I think the second one was more.

186
00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.910
P11: I mean, like… It's…

187
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:59.809
P11: It kind of told you that you weren't eligible right away, so you got your answer quickly, but it made it hard to contact or find out if it was

188
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:01.310
P11: like, accurate.

189
00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:13.140
Moderator: Or another person that you could talk to. I gotcha. So you like that the system gave the answer right away, but you want a way to contact someone else.

190
00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:21.830
Moderator: I gotcha. So, in that sense, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy.

191
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.950
Moderator: What would you give the rating for here? For this?

192
00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:30.749
P11: Compared to the first one, I think the second one's first, higher than 5.

193
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.390
Moderator: Probably a 5, you said?

194
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.880
Moderator: Okay.

195
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:41.549
Moderator: Just because, the answer you gave was, because it was… they gave you your eligibility right away, is that…

196
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:42.020
P11: Yeah.

197
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:42.540
Moderator: Sweet.

198
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:47.219
P11: Instead of waiting, finish the application and waiting and finding out that you're ineligible.

199
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:52.469
Moderator: Okay, and then comparing the two prototypes, which one would you prefer to use, then?

200
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.290
P11: Probably the second one.

201
00:18:55.010 --> 00:19:07.629
Moderator: Okay, so the pineapple one, gotcha. And then, thinking about everything that you just saw so far, so the both prototype, was there too much, too little, or about the right amount of information?

202
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.579
P11: For the second one?

203
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.079
Moderator: Of just overall, in general.

204
00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:24.340
P11: Oh, only because I wasn't familiar with CHAMPVA, but after reading it, I kind of… it does have the right amount of.

205
00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.639
Moderator: Okay. Information, and the right amount per page.

206
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:35.110
Moderator: Gotcha. So at first, you're unfamiliar, but as you go through this, you felt like the amount of information.

207
00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:36.490
Moderator: It feels small.

208
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:37.660
P11: overwhelming stage.

209
00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:38.340
Moderator: Gotcha.

210
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:43.729
Moderator: And then, if you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident in doing so?

211
00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:45.660
P11: Yes.

212
00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:47.250
Moderator: Okay, great.

213
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.629
Moderator: Go ahead and click on the continue button at the bottom of the page there.

214
00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:10.420
Moderator: Alright, and then for the next task, so we've gone through the two prototype. For the next task, if you scroll down to the bottom of the main menu, you'll find, two gray buttons. One is the warning alert. Go ahead and click on that one.

215
00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:20.020
Moderator: I'll read, I will read a scenario, and then you'll review the message, and then please state any questions you may have.

216
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:37.869
Moderator: or feedback that you could provide. So, in the warning alert A here, in this first scenario, you enter the veteran's information, and then you see this message. Can you think out loud on your thoughts around this alert message, and explain what action you would take in this scenario?

217
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:41.369
P11: And confirm the eligibility of their application.

218
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.999
P11: We couldn't find the veterans' information in our system.

219
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:54.150
P11: I would probably… Resubmit the application.

220
00:20:54.710 --> 00:21:00.640
P11: And then follow up with, how we… An in-person? Or a call?

221
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:08.129
Moderator: Okay, so you would continue the application, but you want to do, you want a way to check it, basically.

222
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:18.300
Moderator: Gotcha. And then we can move on to the alert B. Same scenario. You enter the veteran's information, and now you see the following message.

223
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:24.200
P11: We can't confirm your eligibility right now. You can try them later.

224
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.539
P11: Complete your… I feel like the… the page is down, that's probably why they gave that message.

225
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.830
P11: Or there's an error with the page.

226
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:34.920
Moderator: Okay.

227
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.449
P11: And then, in this scenario, what would you do?

228
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.889
P11: Probably wait later, and then reapply again.

229
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.190
Moderator: Gotcha.

230
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:44.920
P11: Alrighty.

231
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:51.570
Moderator: And then we'll move on to the next one. Same scenario, you enter the veteran's information, and then you see this message.

232
00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.880
P11: We can't confirm the eligibility of the applicants right now.

233
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:02.240
P11: If you think this is error, check your information into

234
00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:09.239
P11: I'll probably resubmit my application again, and probably do the same as,

235
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.579
P11: A, and follow up with a person.

236
00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.860
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that.

237
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.680
Moderator: And then, for alert D,

238
00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:23.069
Moderator: Same, same situation, you enter the vendor information, and then you see this message.

239
00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:29.379
P11: Based on the veteran's information, the applicants may not be eligible for 10 EA benefits.

240
00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:41.160
P11: We found that Veterans Information depends enrollment eligibility for TRICARE benefits. If you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHAMPA.

241
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.830
P11: Benefits, if you're eligible.

242
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.270
P11: Sorry, it's, like, really confusing.

243
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:55.830
P11: Okay, so they found my information in the deers.

244
00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:05.699
P11: for TRICARE benefits, I'm not eligible because I'm eligible for TRICARE, I guess. Okay.

245
00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:07.090
P11: I think that makes sense.

246
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:10.999
Moderator: Okay, and then it… what would you do in this scenario?

247
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.870
P11: probably follow up with a person.

248
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:22.659
Moderator: Okay. So, you want to follow up, but you would pause the… your application here?

249
00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:27.390
P11: Yeah, because everybody tells me I'm not eligible because I'm eligible for TRICARE.

250
00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:31.290
Moderator: Gotcha. But you, like before, you want a way to contact.

251
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.579
Moderator: Alright, that makes sense. And then, is there anything here that would make it helpful for you in that process, then?

252
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.680
P11: Maybe a link? Or, contact information?

253
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.740
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that. And then finally, the last alert, Alert E.

254
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:50.219
Moderator: Again, you enter the veteran's information, and then you see this message.

255
00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:53.499
P11: Based on veterans information, I'm sure.

256
00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:55.790
P11: is eligible for the chance, though.

257
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.680
P11: Oh, good. I like that they made it green.

258
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.990
P11: It's very clear.

259
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:13.870
Moderator: Okay, and then you would continue with the application? Gotcha. So across all of the alerts you just saw, how confident do you feel that you know what to do

260
00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:21.629
Moderator: On a, like, scale of 1 to 5, 1 being, not very confident, and then 5 being very confident.

261
00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:23.450
P11: I think 5, maybe?

262
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:31.219
Moderator: Okay, so all the messages has been relatively clear, and you're confident in the actions you're about to take. Does that sound correct?

263
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:31.910
P11: Yes.

264
00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.979
Moderator: Alright. And then, were there any alerts that was confusing or unclear to you?

265
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:52.180
P11: Maybe if they made this area, like, check marks, you were eligible, like, so that is what made you, not qualify, like an X here?

266
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.250
Moderator: Gotcha.

267
00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:58.929
Moderator: So you want a little bit more information here, especially for alert…

268
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.910
P11: Some people just, like, visualize things better than reading.

269
00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:05.840
Moderator: Okay, thank you for that feedback.

270
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:11.799
Moderator: And then if you scroll down to the bottom, there's a button to take you back to the main menu.

271
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:18.880
Moderator: And then, if you scroll down to the bottom here, there is one last task, the summary cards.

272
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.409
Moderator: Go ahead and click on that.

273
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:37.609
Moderator: So in this screen, you'll see four summary cards. The first two, card style A, are from the prototypes we just went through, and then the third and fourth card, card style B, are alternative designs. Please take a few moments to look at all four before we talk about them.

274
00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.280
P11: Okay.

275
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.240
Moderator: Okay, what do you think each car is telling you?

276
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.220
P11: Oh.

277
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.709
P11: one of them between A and B, or between…

278
00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:07.130
Moderator: Just each, each one, so we can go through each one of them. So, like, let's say the first one, what is it telling you?

279
00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:08.679
P11: that the…

280
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:18.130
P11: based on the check marks that the person's eligible for Camp Media, and then the second one, they're not eligible because of the application.

281
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.479
P11: I mean, because of the TRICARE?

282
00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.560
Moderator: Alright.

283
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:26.100
Moderator: And then what about the cardstyle B?

284
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.000
Moderator: So the third one right there, yeah.

285
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.879
P11: I think this part's more clear compared to Part A.

286
00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:50.500
P11: without reading all this, you'll see, like, your responses meet all eligibility requirements for CHAMPA, and then this one, like, it's clearly stated right here, right under.

287
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:54.579
Moderator: I gotcha. So you like that little, that sentence that…

288
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.079
Moderator: Distinctly tell you that you're qualified or not.

289
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:03.999
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, which set is the easiest to understand at a glance?

290
00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:08.920
Moderator: B. And is it because of that, that sentence right there?

291
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.900
P11: Yes.

292
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:16.199
Moderator: Alright. And then, are there any parts of the card that felt unclear or confusing?

293
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.839
P11: No, I don't think so.

294
00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:28.790
Moderator: Okay, so in general, they're not too confusing because of how it's set up, but you like the car style B because that extra sentence there

295
00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:29.879
Moderator: Me too. A lot.

296
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.420
Moderator: Gotcha.

297
00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:38.789
Moderator: Alright, I think that's it for our screen share portion, so you can go ahead and stop the screen share.

298
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.269
Moderator: Give me a second here…

299
00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:50.430
Moderator: And then, is there any other feedback you would like to add about the two prototypes, and then the messages that you just saw?

300
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:55.270
P11: No, I don't think I'm…

301
00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.769
Moderator: I'm sorry, I didn't catch.

302
00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:01.970
P11: Oh, no, I don't think I have any questions.

303
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:09.460
Moderator: Okay. And then, do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

304
00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:20.189
P11: Maybe, like, no, I don't think so.

305
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.889
Moderator: Okay. Maybe if it's clear, like a button and click.

306
00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:28.569
P11: And then, if it doesn't fall through, just, like, a follow-up, contact information?

307
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:34.259
Moderator: Gotcha. So you like a way to contact, to follow up. Gotcha.

308
00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.589
P11: The chat service would probably be more helpful.

309
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:41.120
Moderator: You say a chat service?

310
00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:46.420
Moderator: just a way to contact the VA, follow-up, or a chat service.

311
00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.130
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that feedback.

312
00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:55.049
Moderator: And then, I don't think the observers have any questions. Do you have any questions for me?

313
00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.679
P11: Oh, no, I didn't.

314
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:07.949
Moderator: Alright, then I want to circle back and, reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of the session with our VA partners.

315
00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.080
P11: Yes.

316
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:26.790
Moderator: Okay, and then just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and we'll only share the video with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and the other digital experiences.

317
00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:44.859
Moderator: And then, I just want to say we appreciate you taking your time on your day… out of your day to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback's going to be super helpful for us to continue to work on the site and make it helpful for veterans and their family members. And then, lastly.

318
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:52.950
Moderator: Preaching will kind of send you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know to…

319
00:30:53.560 --> 00:31:01.379
Moderator: provide them with a chance to participate in research studies like this. And then thank you again. Enjoy the rest of your day and weekend.

320
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.130
P11: Oh, thank you, you're welcome.

321
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.610
Moderator: Alright, bye-bye.

322
00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:05.650
P11: Aye.
