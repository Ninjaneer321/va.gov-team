00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.600
Moderator: Alright, I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.830
P3: Okay.

3
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:24.879
Moderator: Alright, and then, are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip for our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.490
P3: Yes, okay.

5
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.680
Moderator: All right, thank you, and that's done with the boiler plates. We'll, do a few warm-up questions here.

6
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.630
Moderator: So,

7
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.850
Moderator: Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veteran Affairs, the CHAMPA program?

8
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.409
P3: No, I have not.

9
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.570
Moderator: And then, have you heard of the CHAMPA program before?

10
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.590
P3: Yes.

11
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.160
Moderator: Alright, and then, can you explain to me, in your own work what you know about the eligibility of that program?

12
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:14.569
P3: Well, when I went through the caregiver program for my husband, that was offered to us, and I don't really remember all the details, because it's been quite a while, and we did choose not to participate in that, because my

13
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.970
P3: TRICARE for Life offered better benefits.

14
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:29.090
Moderator: I gotcha. So, and then, because you have heard of TRICARE, do you think you can explain the difference between TRICARE and CHAMPA?

15
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.950
P3: I'm having to go back a while. To be honest, no.

16
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.889
P3: I don't really remember.

17
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.689
P3: If there was… I know I get all of my medications through TRICARE for Life.

18
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.140
P3: I'm not sure…

19
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:56.279
P3: exactly why we chose not to use it, but it just seemed like it was more convenient for me to stay with the TRICARE for life rather than the CHAMP VA.

20
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:03.570
Moderator: I see. And then I am curious if you are, familiar with sharing screens before?

21
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.640
P3: Yes.

22
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.719
Moderator: Okay, so we will be doing that today. I will go ahead and, in a little bit here, share a link with you in chat.

23
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:29.250
Moderator: Of the prototype, so I'd like you to kind of open it in your browser, and then share your screen, your screen in Zoom. I'll walk you through the process, and then kind of give you a moment to kind of close down any tabs or window that you have running.

24
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.180
Moderator: And, if you're unable to do that for any reason, I can go ahead and share it from my…

25
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.489
Moderator: From my screen, but we'll go ahead and try the first way, which is you sharing the screen here.

26
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.550
P3: Well, I have to admit, I'm not really that technologically Learn it here, so…

27
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.920
P3: Sometimes I have difficulty with that.

28
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.520
Moderator: Okay.

29
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.709
Moderator: So that's completely fine. So I have pasted the link in the chat. Are you able to see the chat?

30
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.300
Moderator: Window?

31
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.019
P3: Well, I see you, and then in the corner, I see a little picture with a person, and a plus and a minus.

32
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.930
Moderator: And then, at the bottom of your screen, I believe there is a few different icons.

33
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.820
Moderator: Are yay.

34
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.309
Moderator: Do you see that?

35
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.019
P3: No, actually, I just see moderator over in my left side.

36
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.030
Moderator: Okay. At the bottom.

37
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:30.329
Moderator: So that's not a problem. What we'll do is, I'll go ahead and kind of share my screen, and then walk you through that instead. Does that sound okay with you?

38
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.300
P3: That's fine.

39
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.679
Moderator: Alright, give me a second to set this up here.

40
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.559
Moderator: Alright, are you able to see the screen?

41
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.960
P3: Well…

42
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.750
Moderator: shared screen.

43
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:14.480
P3: I see you over in the small box, and then I see Eligibility Research Prototype, Blueberry prototype.

44
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.010
Moderator: Okay, alright.

45
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.230
Moderator: So that is what I want you to see.

46
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:18.800
P3: Okay.

47
00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:33.259
Moderator: So, for the first task today, we are going… this is a prototype here, and we have a bunch of different setups, and I just want to confirm that this is kind of big enough for you to see everything fine.

48
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.479
P3: Yes, I can see.

49
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:40.729
Moderator: Okay, great. So, what we'll do is we'll go through, the prototype blueberry, which is the blue…

50
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.160
P3: button at the top here first. Okay. Click into that.

51
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:56.419
Moderator: And then on this first page here, please take a minute or so to look over the instructions, and when you're ready, tell me in your own word what it means to you, and then let me know if I need to scroll down for you.

52
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.109
P3: Okay, you need to scroll up.

53
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.250
P3: Okay.

54
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.020
P3: I'm ready.

55
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.020
Moderator: Okay?

56
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.280
P3: Okay.

57
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.450
Moderator: So in your own word, what is this application for?

58
00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.800
P3: Applying for the CHAMP.

59
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.879
P3: CHAMP VA benefits.

60
00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.760
P3: And, what documents I need.

61
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.870
Moderator: Okay.

62
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.710
P3: And then who is eligible to apply?

63
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.509
P3: Am I supposed to go to the little blue… find out eligible for CHAMP.

64
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.369
Moderator: Do I open a new tab or something?

65
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.289
Moderator: If… if that is what you want to go to. Is that something you want to go to?

66
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.780
P3: Okay, I'm fine.

67
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.089
Moderator: Yeah, alright, so I'll go there for you.

68
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:35.760
Moderator: And then let me know if you want me to scroll all the way down.

69
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.420
P3: Okay, you can scroll.

70
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.180
Moderator: Okay.

71
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.790
P3: Okay.

72
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.920
P3: Okay.

73
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.320
P3: Okay.

74
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.220
P3: Okay.

75
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:47.820
P3: Okay.

76
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.190
Moderator: Get this to the bottom of the page.

77
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.869
Moderator: Alright, and then I'll go back to the… main page here

78
00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.669
Moderator: So, I'll ask the same question, who is eligible or eligible to apply?

79
00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.630
P3: Okay.

80
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:21.050
Moderator: And then, if you're not sure, we can go ahead and move to the next question.

81
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.090
P3: Oh, no, I have not applied for CHAMP VA benefits.

82
00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:28.060
Moderator: Okay.

83
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.850
Moderator: And then…

84
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:38.339
Moderator: If you weren't… so, it sounded like, if you were doing this for real, you would open up this…

85
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:44.529
Moderator: task here, this, new browser, to do… to check out the information, is that correct?

86
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.080
P3: Yes.

87
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:51.169
Moderator: Alright. And then, is there anything here that makes you uncertain about applying?

88
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.859
P3: Well, I guess the thing that I… I…

89
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.310
P3: worry about with, you know, my TRICARE pro-life benefits.

90
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.540
P3: I'm happy with those right now.

91
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:16.369
P3: And I don't know how much of a change it would be if I went to the CHAMP VA benefits, and how it would affect the way that I care for my husband.

92
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:23.299
Moderator: I see. So there is really no incentive or no, reason for you to apply for CHAMFA.

93
00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.779
P3: No, and I'm not sure if it, you know, if there's a,

94
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.960
P3: You have to pay for it.

95
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.400
Moderator: Okay.

96
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.550
P3: Or what the extra benefits would be if I… if I chose to switch to the Champion.

97
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:39.090
Moderator: Gotcha.

98
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.610
Moderator: So you wanted, like, a way to compare the two?

99
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.470
P3: Yes.

100
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.870
Moderator: That makes sense.

101
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:54.010
Moderator: And then, in your mind, I think you're very content with TRICARE right now, so you wouldn't really want to switch. Does that sound correct?

102
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.990
P3: That's probably true.

103
00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:03.300
Moderator: Okay, that makes sense to me. So that means you're most likely not gonna apply for CHAMFA

104
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:08.079
Moderator: But in our case here, we're just testing out the prototype.

105
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.660
P3: Okay.

106
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:15.269
Moderator: We're gonna go ahead and move on to the next portion, which is pretending like you are gonna apply for it.

107
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.979
P3: Okay. But, you know, in reality, it doesn't really apply to you, because you are staying with…

108
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.260
Moderator: at CHICARE.

109
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.830
P3: Okay, well, I hope this is not a problem with.

110
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:32.699
Moderator: No, no. This is just a feed, you know, like I mentioned before, it's just understanding and then wanting to get your feedback on this stuff.

111
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.320
P3: Okay.

112
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:45.499
Moderator: And then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

113
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:52.350
P3: Well, there's a lot of places that I can go to find out more, should I want to.

114
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:55.879
P3: And, you know, be ready to apply for it.

115
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.719
Moderator: Yeah, that is correct. And then…

116
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:05.049
Moderator: So what rating would you give that? With the 1 being very poorly and 5 being very well?

117
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:09.489
P3: Well, it looks like it's… it's fairly easy for me to navigate, so I put a 5.

118
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:10.350
Moderator: Okay.

119
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:18.430
Moderator: So you're saying it's easy to navigate, and there are plenty of, basically linked to help you understand more information. Right.

120
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:33.869
Moderator: That makes sense. Well, we can go ahead and move on to the next task here. And, like I mentioned, since you have TRICARE and you're happy with that, there's no need for you in real life to continue here, but for our purposes, we'll go ahead and continue.

121
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.990
P3: Okay.

122
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:41.499
Moderator: So for the next few pages here, we are gonna…

123
00:11:42.710 --> 00:12:01.340
Moderator: pre-fill your information here, and then please go through these questions, pretending like, like you are filling it out, and then in the next few questions, please remember to kind of think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here, and then when you're ready, just say,

124
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:06.230
Moderator: click continue, basically say continue, and then I'll click the continue button for you.

125
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.910
P3: Okay.

126
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.000
Moderator: To the next page.

127
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:13.760
P3: Okay?

128
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.630
Moderator: You're okay with continuing?

129
00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.879
P3: Yes, if it'll help, I don't want to, like I said, I feel.

130
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:37.910
Moderator: No, don't, don't worry. And then, like I mentioned, we only want to hear your feedback, so we do want to hear your thoughts on, like, these pages, so if there's anything that you stand out to you, or confusing, or you think it's okay, then let me know.

131
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:38.750
P3: Okay.

132
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.500
P3: I'm ready to continue.

133
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:50.949
P3: Okay, I'm the first one, I'm a spouse.

134
00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.120
Moderator: Alright, and then you would just click continue.

135
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.400
P3: Yes.

136
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.310
Moderator: Alright.

137
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:05.960
Moderator: And like I mentioned earlier, we… since this is a prototype, we pre-filled all these, kind of, made-up information about you.

138
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:06.960
P3: Okay.

139
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.400
Moderator: No issues here so far.

140
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:14.919
P3: No, it's fine.

141
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.000
Moderator: Alright, I'll press continue here.

142
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:32.359
P3: Yes, my husband's permanently and totally disabled from a service connection.

143
00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:40.560
Moderator: I gotcha. So, and for this purposes, we'll answer differently, but, you know, since it's a prototype.

144
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:41.330
P3: Okay.

145
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:42.920
Moderator: We'll go ahead and continue with that.

146
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.080
P3: Yes.

147
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.370
Moderator: Okay.

148
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:03.869
P3: Yes, he's in the TRICARE, so the answer would be yes.

149
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.009
Moderator: Yeah, so for yourself, it would technically be yes.

150
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.510
P3: But for this, demo here…

151
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:13.160
Moderator: We're gonna say no, because it shows a different path.

152
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:14.520
P3: Okay.

153
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.110
Moderator: Yeah.

154
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:18.440
Moderator: And then, so, no issue with you so far?

155
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:19.520
P3: No. Makes sense.

156
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:20.600
P3: does.

157
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.070
Moderator: And then, you've got a minute to go through this here.

158
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.130
P3: Yes, I read it.

159
00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:39.299
Moderator: Okay, and then in your own word, tell me what this page means.

160
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:45.630
P3: Well, it just talks about the information, who's eligible, and,

161
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.270
P3: to meet the requirements for CHAMP VA benefits.

162
00:14:52.590 --> 00:15:00.460
Moderator: Gotcha. And then let me make sure that I understood you correctly. If you're eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMFA?

163
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:08.020
P3: Can I say that again?

164
00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:13.510
Moderator: If you're eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMP VA?

165
00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:16.769
P3: That's a good question.

166
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:19.780
Moderator: You are not sure?

167
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.229
P3: Well, yes, I would… I would like to know the…

168
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:26.800
P3: You know, the information about that.

169
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:27.660
Moderator: Yeah.

170
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.750
Moderator: Okay.

171
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.240
Moderator: So, for, for this one.

172
00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:41.930
Moderator: Technically, if you're eligible for TRICARE, you won't be able to get CHAMFA, but for our testing purposes here.

173
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:51.059
Moderator: we, we, you know, we're going through this to see if your feedback on the question's more than the actual eligibility. Okay, yeah.

174
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.150
Moderator: And then I am curious if the check means anything to you here.

175
00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.740
Moderator: Do you see the…

176
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:03.970
P3: Yes, I do. Yes.

177
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.670
Moderator: What do you think the checkmark means to you?

178
00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.810
P3: Well, that I can… Check my responses.

179
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.469
P3: And check my requirements.

180
00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.320
P3: Check the eligibility.

181
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:22.210
Moderator: I see.

182
00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:28.410
Moderator: And then, what do you think the system is telling you about your eligibility here?

183
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.980
P3: It shows that response to eligibility.

184
00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.710
P3: for CHAMP VA.

185
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:57.890
Moderator: Alright, and then, based on this, do you think, for this demo, do you think you're, eligible for, CHAMPA?

186
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:10.560
P3: Yes, I'm eligible.

187
00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.989
Moderator: Okay. And then, what makes you say that?

188
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.810
P3: Well, it says… My veteran is permanently disabled.

189
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.359
P3: The first… the first one.

190
00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:22.939
Moderator: Yeah.

191
00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:28.109
Moderator: So, that means, because it applies to…

192
00:17:28.389 --> 00:17:34.029
Moderator: your situation, you think that, you're eligible for a CHAMFA. Does that sound correct?

193
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.269
P3: Yes, I would be eligible.

194
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.939
P3: You know, checking the first response.

195
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.680
Moderator: Yeah.

196
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.629
Moderator: And then, how confident are you in that understanding?

197
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.690
P3: Well, this one's a little tricky to me.

198
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.050
Moderator: Can you elaborate on that?

199
00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:02.260
P3: Well, I'm trying not to put my situation into You know, the situation that

200
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.350
P3: This one's really hard. I'm having a hard time with it.

201
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:16.440
Moderator: Okay, not a problem. So, it's, can you explain why you're having a hard time with it?

202
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.099
Moderator: Or you're not sure.

203
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:33.540
P3: Well… I know that… There's a permanent disability.

204
00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.639
P3: And he's eligible for TronCater.

205
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:47.440
P3: So that's… that's the part that I'm not sure of.

206
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:55.710
Moderator: Okay, maybe because this, this screen is telling you the opposite of your situation.

207
00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:57.150
P3: Yes, that's it.

208
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:57.920
Moderator: Okay.

209
00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:07.350
Moderator: Which is totally fine, you know, because the situation doesn't apply to you, so it's… it's throwing you off. Does that… does that sound, like, about right?

210
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:09.929
P3: Yes, it does. Okay, which is sad.

211
00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.220
Moderator: putting that into work.

212
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.230
Moderator: Not a problem in there.

213
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:21.370
Moderator: So, that means for this, would you say you would exit application just because it's technically confusing to you, then?

214
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.569
P3: Probably I would.

215
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:30.610
Moderator: Alright, for this one, we'll go ahead and continue, which closes out the… this portion of the prototype here.

216
00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:31.280
P3: Okay.

217
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:42.270
Moderator: And then, I'm curious of what you just went through on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy. How difficult was it to understand that screen?

218
00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:48.019
P3: Well, I would have to put it at a number 4, because it was hard for me to…

219
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:54.950
P3: to project what The, eligibility would be.

220
00:19:54.950 --> 00:20:02.909
Moderator: I gotcha. Can you rephrase that? You're saying 4 as in it was very hard, or you're saying…

221
00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.330
Moderator: Because the rating is 1 is very hard, and 5 is very easy.

222
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.970
P3: Nice.

223
00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.439
P3: Well, to me, I guess I'd have to do a number 1, because it was hard.

224
00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.709
Moderator: Okay, so you'd say, I gotcha. Just because that screen was confusing to you.

225
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:25.289
Moderator: Does that sound about right?

226
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.080
P3: Yes.

227
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.880
Moderator: Alright.

228
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:45.260
Moderator: Thank you for that. And then for the next portion of the prototype, we'll go through Prototype Pineapple, which is the orange button here. Okay. And in this one, it's very similar to the previous one. There is just going to be a few different questions here.

229
00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:48.329
Moderator: So I'll press… go ahead and press continue.

230
00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:55.110
Moderator: And then I'll skip this part here, just because it's gonna be…

231
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.180
Moderator: Very similar to what you saw.

232
00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:57.760
Moderator: Brian.

233
00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:10.750
Moderator: like I mentioned before, these are, like, you know, the same screens. Go ahead and take a minute or two to go through this, and let me know to press continue when you're ready.

234
00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:22.789
P3: Okay, I'm finished.

235
00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.600
Moderator: Alright.

236
00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:24.550
Moderator: Thank you.

237
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:32.410
P3: Okay.

238
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.520
Moderator: Okay.

239
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:39.120
P3: Okay.

240
00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:56.249
Moderator: So, how do you feel about the way this application checks your eligibility here?

241
00:21:56.630 --> 00:22:02.289
P3: Well, I like the way that they checked it for me, you know, on the DEERS program.

242
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.070
Moderator: Okay.

243
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:08.009
Moderator: Did you find it, helpful, intrusive, or something else?

244
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:09.720
P3: No, it was helpful.

245
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:13.599
Moderator: Okay, and then, do you trust this information to be accurate?

246
00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.439
P3: Yes, I do.

247
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:30.569
Moderator: All right, and let's… I know for your situation, you under… you're part of TRICARE, but let's say this is a completely new thing. After seeing this message, what else would you want to see here after reading this message here?

248
00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:43.110
P3: Well, I guess if I were really applying for it, I'd like to know why I'm not eligible.

249
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.709
Moderator: I gotcha. So you want more information here.

250
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:47.390
P3: Yes.

251
00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:56.700
Moderator: Now, if you believe this check was wrong, and that you're actually not eligible for TRICARE, what would you do here?

252
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.369
P3: Well, I guess if I weren't eligible, I wasn't eligible, so I'd, you know, drop it at that.

253
00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.509
Moderator: Okay, so in your case, you wouldn't continue the application.

254
00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.600
P3: Right. You would just exit here. Yes.

255
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:22.389
Moderator: Gotcha. And then would you, even try to call someone to verify it, or you just drop it because of the system saying this?

256
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.550
P3: Well, I would go to our local VA,

257
00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.640
P3: office, like, when we went for the…

258
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.910
P3: caregiver program, because they have a lot of information, and I would call them.

259
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.200
Moderator: Okay, that actually makes sense to me.

260
00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:44.989
Moderator: And then, does this feel like the system is helping you understand your option, or the system's blocking you from applying?

261
00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:55.389
P3: Well, it's helping me. I would like to know all of my options before I completely, you know, discredited it.

262
00:23:55.390 --> 00:24:00.460
Moderator: Right, that makes sense. Alright, we are good to continue. Are you ready?

263
00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.399
P3: Yes, I'm ready.

264
00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.100
Moderator: Okay.

265
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.340
Moderator: And let me know when you're ready to continue.

266
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:27.220
P3: Well, the answer would be yes.

267
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.079
Moderator: Right. In your case, it would be yes. Yeah, yes. But in this prototype, it's a no.

268
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:33.790
P3: Okay.

269
00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:34.180
Moderator: Yeah.

270
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:44.880
P3: Okay.

271
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.610
P3: Yes.

272
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:52.770
Moderator: Alright… Then I'll stop here again. Please take a minute to go through this.

273
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.580
Moderator: And then I'll ask them a question.

274
00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:09.890
P3: Yes, I would continue.

275
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.190
Moderator: Can you… Explain why.

276
00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.529
P3: Well, I would know my eligibility requirements.

277
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.519
P3: And I might think I'm still eligible, so I would continue.

278
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:30.239
Moderator: I gotcha. So, despite this screen saying, you may not be eligible, you still want to continue? Does that sound correct?

279
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.330
P3: when I would want to continue.

280
00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.610
Moderator: I'm sorry, can you…

281
00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:37.940
P3: I would continue.

282
00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:38.870
Moderator: Okay.

283
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.679
Moderator: And then… so… So, just like before, you would continue,

284
00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:50.889
Moderator: Even though this… this screen is saying that you're not eligible. I just want to confirm that. Does that…

285
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.190
P3: I would continue.

286
00:25:52.190 --> 00:26:07.900
Moderator: Thank you. And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, we're doing the scale again, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this second prototype here?

287
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.969
P3: Well, I want to be honest.

288
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:16.639
P3: And it's really hard for me to project, you know, myself into this.

289
00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:23.330
P3: And so, for me, Sometimes all of this is very hard, so I would say a 1.

290
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.349
Moderator: Okay, yeah, thank you for your honesty. We like that.

291
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.480
Moderator: And then…

292
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:43.459
Moderator: let me take a step data here. So, comparing the two prototypes, the prototype blueberry, the first one you saw, and the prototype pineapple, which is the one you just went through, which one would you prefer to use.

293
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.979
P3: I guess the prototype pineapple.

294
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:54.670
Moderator: And is there a reason why for that one?

295
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.990
P3: Well, to be honest, no.

296
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:01.679
P3: They're… I… they both seem very similar.

297
00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:08.130
P3: I gotcha. And, you know… Whether to continue or not.

298
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:20.010
Moderator: Yeah, I gotcha. Now, so for everything that you saw, was it, was there too much, too little, or about the right amount of information?

299
00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:34.230
P3: Well, it was about the right information. I know that I would continue on researching more information about

300
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:36.929
P3: Eligibility and non-eligibility.

301
00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:43.179
Moderator: I'm sorry, so you said it was… you… it's enough information, or too little? I didn't…

302
00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:53.040
P3: Well, it was enough information, and it also gave me information so that I could research farther, you know, into eligibility or not eligible.

303
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.969
Moderator: Gotcha. So you like that option to research more for yourself?

304
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.320
P3: Yes, yes, I do.

305
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:03.309
Moderator: And then, if you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident in doing so?

306
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:12.429
P3: After I had researched everything, and taken notes, and, you know, was more learned in it, yes, I would share it.

307
00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.360
Moderator: Okay.

308
00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.939
Moderator: Thank you for that.

309
00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:26.369
Moderator: So I think we… let's see… in here, I'd say we have about 10 minutes, I would say. We still have time to go through a few additional tasks for you here.

310
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:42.110
Moderator: I'm gonna click here on this warning alert messages here, and what it'll do is it'll just compare a bunch of different messages for you two, and then I just want your feedback on those messages. Does that sound okay with you?

311
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.000
P3: That's fine.

312
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:43.910
Moderator: Alright.

313
00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:53.629
Moderator: And then… so I clicked into the, into here. So what we'll do is, there's a bunch of different warning messages where

314
00:28:53.810 --> 00:29:06.399
Moderator: after you, you fill out the veteran's name, and the system checks, and it gives you, you know, all these different messages. So for each messages, I'd like you to read them, and then kind of give your comment on them.

315
00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.350
P3: Okay.

316
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.889
P3: Okay, you can move it up.

317
00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.550
P3: Okay.

318
00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.030
Moderator: Okay.

319
00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:07.169
Moderator: So, I'll start with just, I guess, all of them. Across all the alerts you saw, how confident do you, know what

320
00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.480
Moderator: to do.

321
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:14.709
Moderator: Like, let's say if you see Alert A, how confident are you, on what to do next?

322
00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.280
P3: Well, I would go back and recheck my information.

323
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.250
Moderator: Okay, for that one.

324
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:30.820
Moderator: And is… is it because this is clear that you think that this is an error?

325
00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:32.370
Moderator: On your end, then?

326
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:39.860
P3: Yes, because I always… And I want to recheck just to make sure.

327
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.560
Moderator: Right, that makes sense. And what about Alert B?

328
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:48.139
Moderator: What do you think it's telling you?

329
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.930
P3: Wanted to try again.

330
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.460
P3: Or… continue.

331
00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:01.370
Moderator: Okay, so you would either try again or continue.

332
00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:10.130
P3: Now… No, I… no. I would not.

333
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:14.309
P3: I would continue to complete the application.

334
00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:18.259
Moderator: I gotcha. So, because it gave you the option to continue your.

335
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:18.600
P3: Yes.

336
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.830
Moderator: Alright.

337
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.419
Moderator: And then what about option C, or Alert C here?

338
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:38.750
P3: Well, I would be concerned that they can't find the eligibility, the reason behind that, so I guess I would select continue.

339
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:39.790
Moderator: Okay.

340
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:45.109
Moderator: So, you concerned, would there be anything that we can do here that would not,

341
00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:51.149
Moderator: That would, basically, you would make it more confident in the system.

342
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:55.600
P3: Well, I would want to confirm the eligibility, and I'd like to know how to do that.

343
00:31:55.790 --> 00:31:59.839
Moderator: Gotcha, so you want more instructions here, or more information here.

344
00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.809
Moderator: And then, what about Alert D?

345
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:26.120
P3: Okay? If all of this, you know, they found all the information and I wasn't,

346
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:33.339
P3: Eligible, you know, that would be the end of… the, application.

347
00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:40.699
Moderator: I gotcha. So you want an option… would you say that, you would close out the application here if you saw this message, then?

348
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:41.749
P3: Yes, I would.

349
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:47.220
Moderator: Okay. And then you would like the option to close out the application if you read this message, then?

350
00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:49.220
P3: Yes.

351
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:57.629
Moderator: Alright, that sounds good to me. And then, of these alerts, were there any alerts that's kind of confusing or unclear to you?

352
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:01.859
P3: No, I would just be concerned why my…

353
00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.790
P3: Veterans information is not in the system.

354
00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:07.219
Moderator: And I want to find out why.

355
00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:11.500
P3: And, more information on my eligibility.

356
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.950
Moderator: I gotcha. Thank you for that.

357
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.680
Moderator: Alright, and then…

358
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:34.199
Moderator: I do have one last, task for you here. It's the summary cards. Okay. So, at the end of, you know, of both of those prototypes, you saw those gray cards that summarized the… the system summarized your eligibility, so I'll go ahead and click into there.

359
00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.779
Moderator: And then, again, I just want your feedback on it.

360
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.900
P3: Yum.

361
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:57.579
Moderator: So on this screen, you see four different summary cards. The first two, the top two, card style A, are from the prototypes that you just went through, and then the bottom two, the card style B, are alternative to the design. Please take a few moments to look at all four, and then we'll talk about them.

362
00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.550
P3: Okay.

363
00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.760
Moderator: Are you ready for the questions?

364
00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:24.229
P3: Okay, hang on just a second.

365
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.929
Moderator: Okay.

366
00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:26.129
Moderator: Not a problem.

367
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.380
P3: Okay.

368
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:40.150
Moderator: Alright.

369
00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:40.829
P3: Freedom?

370
00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:43.729
Moderator: What do you think each card is telling you?

371
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:50.009
P3: Well, it goes through the checklist of whether or not the,

372
00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:53.829
P3: the veteran applicant is eligible for TRICARE.

373
00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:59.029
P3: Or if he's not eligible, Or we're not eligible for TRICARE.

374
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.030
Moderator: I gotcha.

375
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.190
P3: And then…

376
00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.519
Moderator: Yeah, go ahead.

377
00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:10.830
P3: Now, and just, you know, gives more of a… Criteria for eligibility.

378
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:12.859
P3: We're not being eligible.

379
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.810
Moderator: And then, between these two sets, the top two, or the bottom two.

380
00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.529
Moderator: Which set is the easiest to understand at a glance?

381
00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:28.539
P3: I guess, card style B.

382
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.070
Moderator: Okay, so you like car style B, can you…

383
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:37.809
Moderator: Specify what makes this card style easier to understand?

384
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:52.600
P3: Actually, can I change that?

385
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.749
Moderator: Yeah, of course.

386
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:57.330
P3: I like cardstyle A, because it's… it's pretty…

387
00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:00.519
P3: Cut forward, you know, with

388
00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.730
P3: In a shorter version, and easier to understand.

389
00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:12.000
Moderator: I gotcha. And in this card style A, what makes it easier to understand for you? You mentioned that it's a shorter, more,

390
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.289
Moderator: Like a shorter cutout.

391
00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.140
Moderator: more straightforward? Does that sound correct?

392
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:19.040
P3: Yes.

393
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:21.279
P3: That's the word, straightforward.

394
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:25.040
Moderator: Okay, so you like it because it's shorter and more straightforward.

395
00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:25.710
P3: Yes.

396
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.750
Moderator: Alright And then, is there any part of the car that felt, kind of unclear or confusing?

397
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:37.910
P3: No, it was specific on, you know, What the veteran does.

398
00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:43.600
P3: Situation is, and… You know, the eligibility.

399
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.720
Moderator: I gotcha.

400
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.409
Moderator: So let me go back to the main page here.

401
00:36:49.720 --> 00:37:01.779
Moderator: And that concludes the, kind of, the four different tasks here. I'm curious if you have any other feedback that you'd like to add between the two prototypes and the messages that you saw today.

402
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:10.099
P3: Well, it's easier for me to have specifics And… It was hard to…

403
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:15.359
P3: Judge between all the different ones, because they basically were saying the same thing.

404
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.179
Moderator: It's just worded just a little bit differently.

405
00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.430
Moderator: I gotcha.

406
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:24.460
P3: It took a little while to figure out, you know, exactly.

407
00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:25.880
P3: What?

408
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:28.199
P3: which one I would go with.

409
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.450
Moderator: I gotcha.

410
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:35.700
Moderator: And then, do you have a preference for how you want to go through, like, an eligibility?

411
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:42.919
Moderator: on an online platform like this? Is there a way that you'd like to go through this?

412
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:44.960
P3: Well, a checklist.

413
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.259
P3: You know, of eligibility.

414
00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.370
P3: And that way I could figure out, you know, if I'm eligible or not.

415
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.270
Moderator: I gotcha. That makes sense to me.

416
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:55.919
Moderator: And then I stopped.

417
00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.900
Moderator: Share screen here.

418
00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.820
Moderator: I'll check if there's any observer questions.

419
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:07.980
Moderator: And I'm not seeing any. I am curious if you have any questions for me.

420
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.990
Moderator: So far.

421
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:14.470
P3: No, no, you, you were very helpful, and

422
00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:21.140
P3: you know, it was easy for me to find the explanation that I needed to to converse.

423
00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.089
Moderator: I see. Thank you for that.

424
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:32.530
Moderator: And then, I do want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we shared a video of this clip, of the session with our VA partners?

425
00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.850
P3: Yes.

426
00:38:33.850 --> 00:38:49.760
Moderator: Okay, thank you. And then, just to remind you, we remove any information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and it's only shared within the VA and VA partners for the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

427
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.580
P3: I'm comfortable with that. Anything to help the VA

428
00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:59.640
P3: You know, help veterans and their families would be helpful.

429
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:12.060
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then, I just want to circle… I would just want to say that we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is going to be really, helpful for us to…

430
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:27.030
Moderator: kind of continue to work to make this site and make it really work for the veteran and their family. And lastly, Prejen will send you, like, a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans and their family member that you may know.

431
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:36.289
Moderator: to provide them with the chance to participate in one of these research studies in the future. And again, thank you so much, and enjoy the rest of your day.

432
00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.900
P3: Okay, well, great, thank you, and same to you.

433
00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:40.369

434
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:41.529
