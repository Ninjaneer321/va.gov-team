00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.990
P10: Go.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.440
Moderator: So, I've started recording, and, like, I'd like to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.420
P10: Yes.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:22.280
Moderator: Alright, and then, are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.609
P10: That is fine.

6
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:42.490
Moderator: All right, thank you, and that's it for the boilerplates. We can get to the, you know, the rest of the questions here. For warm-up, I got a couple of questions. Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program, part of the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the CHAMFA program?

7
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.370
P10: Never.

8
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.309
Moderator: Alright, and then, have you heard of the Champ Hub program before?

9
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.200
P10: No.

10
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.000
Moderator: Alright, and then, have you ever heard of TRICARE?

11
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.689
P10: We have TRICARE.

12
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.590
Moderator: Okay, and then… oh, you have TRICARE.

13
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.110
Moderator: Are you able to explain what TRICARE is in your own word?

14
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:08.960
P10: Tricare when my husband served in the Air Force, and TRICARE was our medical coverage.

15
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.740
P10: While he was in the military, but now he's retired?

16
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.390
P10: But we still have… we pay for TRICARE.

17
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.750
Moderator: I see, alright, thank you for that. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you a link in chat that has the prototype.

18
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:42.180
Moderator: And then I would like you to open it up in your browser and then share it with us on the shared screen, basically, in Zoom. And then I just want to confirm that you have… you are on a desktop or a laptop right now, or is it a mobile device?

19
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.600
P10: No, I'm on my, laptop.

20
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.759
Moderator: Okay, sounds good, so I'll give you the… The laptop or slash desktop.

21
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.340
Moderator: link here.

22
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.680
Moderator: Go ahead and open that, and then it takes a little bit of time to load.

23
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.040
P10: Okay.

24
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.409
Moderator: And then once it does, please do a screen share.

25
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.299
Moderator: And then let me know if you need any, help.

26
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.229
Moderator: Okay, I see it…

27
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.120
P10: Okay.

28
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.820
Moderator: That you have to allow…

29
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.280
P10: Oh, let's go. Okay.

30
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.000
Moderator: Alright.

31
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.920
P10: Okay.

32
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.650
Moderator: What?

33
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.610
P10: Here, I don't know why that's there.

34
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.639
Moderator: You don't have to…

35
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.660
P10: Yeah.

36
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.280
Moderator: Yeah.

37
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.810
Moderator: I think you can just exit out of that little screen there.

38
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.790
Moderator: Alrighty.

39
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:47.460
Moderator: So, what you see on the screen now, I do see the rest of your desktop, I'm not sure if you want it bigger or smaller, up to you.

40
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.930
P10: That's fine.

41
00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:49.700
Moderator: Okay.

42
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.729
Moderator: So, here is what we have on,

43
00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:14.310
Moderator: In the prototype menu here, we have a couple of different prototypes. We are going to start with the pineapple one first, so it's that orange button, if you can go ahead and click on that. On this first page, please take a minute or so to look over the instruction, and when you're ready, in your own word, tell me what this means to you.

44
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.660
P10: Okay, so…

45
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.100
P10: It looks like an introduction, right, for…

46
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.400
P10: Is it CHAPA, or Chapba?

47
00:03:49.010 --> 00:04:00.460
P10: An application for, essentially, medical care. Well, it looks, for me, it would be outside of, or…

48
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.279
P10: Civilian, not active duty?

49
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.490
P10: So then it basically says, you know.

50
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:20.149
P10: introduction, like, have you heard of it, which I have never. So… and then the application process, or check eligibility, and then… basically step on… step by step.

51
00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:29.499
P10: For… Understanding, checking your eligibility, and then what you need.

52
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.020
Moderator: Okay.

53
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.809
P10: for it.

54
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.880
P10: Even has a… How long the application, after you apply, so…

55
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.759
Moderator: And then… Pretty… Okay, go ahead.

56
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.390
P10: I was gonna say, pretty, step-by-step, I like that. Old.

57
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.330
Moderator: And then, who is eligible to apply?

58
00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.210
P10: So that was stated in the beginning, and at a glance, I can't remember, but it says.

59
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:10.930
P10: If you are a spouse, dependent, or survivor of a veteran or service member who meets certain requirements, you may be…

60
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.920
P10: You may qualify for health insurance.

61
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.490
P10: So…

62
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.650
Moderator: You see…

63
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.550
P10: Of a veteran or service member.

64
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:39.579
P10: But it says certain requirements, so I would say that not all service members, you have to meet a certain criteria. So then it says right here, check your eligibility. Find out if you're eligible, so I guess you would have to open up tab, right?

65
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.219
Moderator: I don't know if it…

66
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.470
P10: Works, but okay.

67
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.710
P10: Let's see… Eligibility… I mean, I guess I could've… okay.

68
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.140
P10: It's a lot of information.

69
00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:05.600
P10: So I guess, let me see if this works, but I would assume… Okay, maybe not?

70
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:16.560
P10: But yeah, so I would have to see if I was eligible, but I'm not 100% sure…

71
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:29.939
P10: It says veterans, no active duty or military, but it says… in the prior screen, it said certain criteria, and I don't quite see… Okay, let's see.

72
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.319
P10: Okay, so now I see it says…

73
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.510
P10: At least one of these must be true.

74
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.729
P10: So, I guess you would have to meet.

75
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.069
P10: Okay, so… It looks like Pete… who was… your question was, who was eligible?

76
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.010
Moderator: Yeah.

77
00:06:51.010 --> 00:07:00.509
P10: So… I went to eligibility, and now it says here… That you were the spells?

78
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:09.629
P10: Let's say you're the spouse or dependent child of a veteran permanently or totally disabled, or you're surviving…

79
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:22.680
P10: Okay, so for my quick understanding, is your spouse has to be permanently, like, 100% disabled, or, unfortunately, have passed away because you're a surviving spouse or dependent.

80
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:32.309
P10: who was at the time of their death rated permanently. Yeah, so it looks like you have to be 100%

81
00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:43.939
P10: Dependent spouse, A dependent or spouse of a military member who is 100% disabled rating, or deceased.

82
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:50.730
Moderator: I see. Okay, and then we can go ahead and go back to the prototype, so that orange button there.

83
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.090
Moderator: Yeah.

84
00:07:52.420 --> 00:08:01.060
Moderator: So on this page, is there any reason that you might not be eligible?

85
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:08.399
P10: If your spouse is not 100% disabled.

86
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:15.880
P10: Okay. But if it's, like, say your spouse is 50% disabled, I would say you are not… you do not qualify.

87
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.270
Moderator: Gotcha.

88
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.919
Moderator: And then, I want to draw your attention to step one there, the,

89
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:33.630
Moderator: where it says, we will… will also help you check your eligibility when you complete this form. What is your expectation, if any, when you read this sentence?

90
00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:38.840
Moderator: It's that middle.

91
00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.789
P10: This check eligibility.

92
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:41.689
Moderator: And then that middle section.

93
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:50.940
P10: Okay, this one right here will also help you check your eligibility when you complete this form. I am assuming that they are going to,

94
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.520
P10: asks you for…

95
00:08:53.850 --> 00:09:04.079
P10: your social security number to confirm that you are indeed a dependent of a military member. Okay. I think,

96
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:10.260
P10: I know that I am assigned a specific, you know, number under my husband as a dependent.

97
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.019
P10: So I would think that they would want, some information there.

98
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.609
P10: Maybe even down to, like…

99
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.329
P10: Retirement Day, or something to that effect.

100
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.930
Moderator: I gotcha.

101
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.979
Moderator: And then, is there anything here that makes you uncertain about applying?

102
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:40.849
P10: Well, I mean, it's helpful to know they'll check the eligibility, so I'm thinking that they'll do that.

103
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:51.720
P10: I personally don't know the whole entire process and how deep, like, it's connected in regards to

104
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.510
P10: how do they know what his eligibility is?

105
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:13.240
P10: I know, personally, here, I live in the state of Nebraska, and there's something called Homestead, and a lot of times, he has to log on, and he has to print this paper that says he's 100% disabled, and then with that paper, I take it to the county, and so I don't know how this process works, but…

106
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.840
Moderator: I gotcha.

107
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:21.049
P10: connected in that. And the only reason why I say all this is because one of the parts of this is death.

108
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:34.570
P10: And I don't know how easy or not it is for someone to obtain that information. Again, how linked these systems are, I don't know, and I don't know if it's just one of those things, like, you upload? I don't know.

109
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.600
Moderator: Okay.

110
00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.529
Moderator: And then, in your case, would you continue, or would you want more information first?

111
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:46.640
P10: I would continue, because I would need to know, okay, what…

112
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:58.950
P10: I would click on the button to see… to check my eligibility, because it might just be that simple, where I'm just entering my Department of Defense number, or my social, or his social.

113
00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.840
Moderator: Gotcha.

114
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:17.590
P10: And it might say, yes, P10, you are eligible, or no, P10, you aren't. And I'm hoping that it will tell me the yes, why I am, or no, why I'm not. If it says yes, then I'm gonna move forward. If it says no, I can deep dive and really question it, or maybe it's just that simple, like, no, your husband is 50% rating and you don't qualify, and I'll move on.

115
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.870
Moderator: I gotcha. So you want to go through the process, just to confirm?

116
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.139
P10: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I would definitely go with it.

117
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:37.059
Moderator: And then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

118
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.189
P10: Based on this, I mean, I feel pretty solid. I feel like it's an 8. I like that…

119
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:47.020
P10: I like it's structured, I like that it's…

120
00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:59.899
P10: laid out for someone like me that just doesn't want to get lost in the sauce of a whole bunch of words. I personally hate visiting TRICARE website, because it is just so overwhelming and bombarding with tabs.

121
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:05.949
P10: links… articles, information, I'm just like, what? Anyway…

122
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:06.670
Moderator: Gotcha.

123
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:19.129
P10: So I like this tab, and this, okay, learn about applying, this is your eligibility, yes or no. And then I like number 2, it says gather your information, yourself.

124
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:26.640
P10: Anyone who's applying for, I'm assuming, my kids, and your spouse,

125
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:35.479
P10: The only thing, I would have to scroll down, because… what… what information am I gathering? Let me look real quick.

126
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:36.290
Moderator: Gotcha.

127
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:40.319
P10: So gather information. So all those people live in my house, easy enough.

128
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.040
P10: Okay, so for this, you would need…

129
00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:52.680
P10: to submit the supporting documents. So, like I thought, you would have to submit documents. So, health insurance cards…

130
00:12:54.870 --> 00:13:00.440
P10: I… that would… my… I don't know, like, what… like, current health? Like, I don't know, that's…

131
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:09.159
Moderator: Right. I want to ask a clarifying question here. So, it's on a scale of 1 to 5, and you gave it an 8.

132
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.730
P10: Oh, okay.

133
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:11.549
Moderator: thinking, like, a 4 or a…

134
00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:17.560
P10: I think it's 5. I mean, I just… I think it's pretty solid. Okay. User-friendly.

135
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:24.719
Moderator: Gotcha. Alright, thank you for that. And then we can move on to the next task, which, if you scroll down, you'll see a blue box.

136
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:27.800
Moderator: Go ahead and click on the,

137
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.029
Moderator: Alright, scroll down a little bit more.

138
00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:34.489
Moderator: Right there, on the start your form without signing in.

139
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:54.990
Moderator: Go ahead and click on that. So, since it's a prototype, we filled out all the information you would normally type in when you're doing this for real. Please go through the next few questions and remember to kind of think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here. You can click continue when you're ready.

140
00:13:55.850 --> 00:14:10.229
P10: Okay, so step one is eligibility. First, we will ask questions. Okay, that's what I want. We'll use the veteran's information to confirm. Okay, so then, make sure I have his social written down.

141
00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:20.750
P10: veteran applicants who need the CHAPA benefit, you won't need to upload, so I don't need his DD214, that's… that's great.

142
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:28.139
P10: You must meet all eligibility requirements for CHAPA. If you're not eligible and submit an application, this may…

143
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:36.750
P10: If you are not eligible and submit application, this may delay benefits for other…

144
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.919
P10: Okay, I guess. I don't…

145
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.970
Moderator: I don't know why that's really important, but okay, so…

146
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.250
P10: Yeah. Not sure what that last statement is about, but…

147
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.849
P10: okay, I don't want to bombard your system, I don't know, but I'm gonna just hit OK.

148
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:53.370
Moderator: Okay.

149
00:14:53.940 --> 00:15:09.900
P10: Okay, your information, which of these best describes you? So, I am the spouse, dependent survivor. Okay, I am a veteran applying for benefits, okay, I'm applying for benefits on the behalf of someone else, okay, which is probably pretty cool, because I do know that there are some

150
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:15.000
P10: People that help veterans apply, so that just makes sense.

151
00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.370
Moderator: Okay.

152
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:25.249
P10: Alright, and… let's see. Veteran's name, date of birth, and identification.

153
00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.420
P10: Information.

154
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:38.070
P10: I think that… Sometimes people can go through things really quick.

155
00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:47.560
P10: And I think that someone can easily make a quick mistake here, and overlook that veteran's name, date of birth, and identification, and just…

156
00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.860
P10: Just off of just being a rush, or just…

157
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:58.390
P10: a naturally seeing first name, we will go to that. I think that veteran's name…

158
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.620
P10: Maybe should be, maybe here, veteran's first name.

159
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.270
Moderator: I see.

160
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:12.629
P10: Only because I think that sometimes we are so robotic in our lives, or sometimes we're in a rush, or…

161
00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:26.740
P10: just out of force of habit. We don't send… we don't read these… we see eligibility, we kind of scan, but not really. We go here, first name, and… someone, maybe not a lot of people, but I think that that might happen.

162
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.550
P10: Can put their name.

163
00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:33.090
Moderator: Gotcha.

164
00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.199
P10: I think, I don't know. And I know it's here, but…

165
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:43.709
P10: I mean, because even me as a mom, there's times where I have accidentally put my name here when it… it was meant for my child.

166
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.429
P10: It's a silly mistake, but it just happened.

167
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:54.229
P10: Alright, so entering the information of the veteran who… sponsoring this application.

168
00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:56.590
P10: So it would be my spouse.

169
00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:02.580
P10: Date of birth, social, all that stuff is easy and good.

170
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.690
P10: Okay.

171
00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:06.160
Moderator: Okay.

172
00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:11.020
Moderator: Go ahead and read the message.

173
00:17:11.109 --> 00:17:12.309
P10: Based on the veteran's.

174
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:13.909
Moderator: I'll pause you right here.

175
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:17.980
Moderator: Sorry, I'll…

176
00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:25.069
Moderator: Yeah, and then, after you read the message, I'll go ahead and ask you, like, a series of questions.

177
00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.950
P10: Okay.

178
00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:35.829
P10: Alright, based on the veteran's information, applicants may not be eligible for CHABA benefits. We found the veteran information in the defense

179
00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.170
P10: Even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible.

180
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.750
P10: Okay.

181
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.800
P10: It's a lot of information there.

182
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.230
P10: I'll probably have to read it again.

183
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.930
Moderator: How do you…

184
00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:55.890
P10: Oh, go ahead, take your time, then. Yeah, I have to read it again, because it's a lot of information. Based on the veteran's information, okay, applicants may not…

185
00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:58.679
P10: be eligible. Hmm.

186
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:08.770
P10: Okay, we found the veteran's information in the DEERS Enrollment Eligibility, which DEERS is where I'm enrolled as a spouse for TRICARE benefits. Okay.

187
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.060
P10: Even if you aren't enrolled.

188
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:23.339
P10: even if you're not enrolled… enrolled in what? TRICARE? I'm not… I'm not sure. You aren't eligible for CHAPA benefits if…

189
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:30.159
P10: You're eligible for So, you could be eligible for TRICARE, but not CHOPA. Okay.

190
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:33.430
P10: I had to, like, really break that down in my head.

191
00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.500
Moderator: And then, so how do you feel about the way this application checks your eligibility?

192
00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:49.340
P10: I… I think it… it does what it does, right? It… it… it… it…

193
00:18:49.650 --> 00:19:04.170
P10: did what I thought it would, in that it was a system, which is DEERS, which I'm aware of that my husband has me registered under him as a dependent, and that's typically how I do qualify for, like, an ID card, or access to the base, or whatever, right?

194
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:10.389
P10: So, this chapa, it looks like it's the same thing. It's verifying what I am and am not.

195
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.540
P10: Eligible for.

196
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:26.170
P10: So, this tells me… that… Which is a little confusing, because it says that applicants may not be eligible.

197
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.909
P10: Like… Am I or am I not?

198
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.230
P10: May not. I don't know.

199
00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.190
P10: But I guess maybe, potentially, this is just,

200
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.939
P10: Just a note to self, like, hey…

201
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:47.230
P10: Just because you get TriKid does not mean… that you automatically get CHAPA.

202
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:52.409
Moderator: Right. And then, did this… does this feel helpful, intrusive, or something else?

203
00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:58.970
P10: I think that this is a little com- this, in this placement, is very confusing to me.

204
00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:00.909
P10: Not sure why.

205
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.750
P10: This placement is, at this point.

206
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:13.499
P10: Maybe it should have been… Before… Maybe, like…

207
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:22.220
P10: before I started the process, like, so, like, I don't know.

208
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:41.010
P10: maybe just this blanket statement here that specifies, alright, just FYI, before starting this application, note that just because you qualify for TRICARE benefits does not necessarily mean that you are or aren't eligible for CHAPA benefits.

209
00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:44.780
Moderator: Okay, so you want, additional clarification, essentially.

210
00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:52.100
P10: Yeah, because this can be very confusing, especially to an old person. Yeah. Especially this may not, and then it's…

211
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:59.699
P10: It… for me, for an old person, again, I just feel like,

212
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:08.109
P10: You get to this point, and it says that, and you're like, oh, wait, should I go on? Do I go on? I guess I'll see what happens next.

213
00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.330
Moderator: Okay.

214
00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.960
P10: This sound… this feels just like… Not great placement.

215
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:19.599
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, do you trust this information? Do you trust that this information's accurate?

216
00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:23.259
P10: Yes.

217
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:35.479
Moderator: Alright, and then what would you do if you, after seeing this message, what else, or yeah, what would you do if you see this message when you're going through an application?

218
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:38.100
P10: I would just hit continue, just to see what happens next.

219
00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.290
Moderator: I see. And then, what else would you like to see there, then?

220
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.110
Moderator: That would be helpful for you.

221
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:48.819
P10: What else would I like to see?

222
00:21:51.850 --> 00:22:09.049
P10: I mean, I… I would just continue the application. I don't think there's anything additional that I would like to see. I… what I don't want to see is, this… this being stated. I would like to… maybe… okay, so maybe this little box, or this… this little sink of information can be…

223
00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:13.249
P10: Towards the end of my application, or at the end of my application.

224
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:14.090
Moderator: I gotcha.

225
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:20.920
P10: This might make someone hesitant, or now very questioned in life, but they haven't even made it through the dang application yet.

226
00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.000
Moderator: Okay, so.

227
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:29.790
P10: So I think had I got to his social, put it all in, and then just hit continue to whatever else is next, and then I saw this towards the end.

228
00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:35.720
P10: just to provide, like, that buffer, that clarification, you may be in, you know, whatever, TRICARE.

229
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:37.090
Moderator: I gotcha.

230
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:38.580
Moderator: Alright, and then…

231
00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:46.089
Moderator: If you believe that this check was wrong, and that you're actually not eligible for TRICARE, so what would you do?

232
00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:53.600
P10: Well, what… I'm confused. So, I would…

233
00:22:53.970 --> 00:23:06.119
P10: It says may not. So, before I did anything else, like, deep dive the dang web on TRICARE or, Deere's and his eligibility number and all that, I'm gonna just finish this.

234
00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.000
P10: I'm gonna hit continue.

235
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:09.330
Moderator: I gotcha.

236
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.839
P10: Yeah, I probably can be like…

237
00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:20.379
P10: I can go down a rabbit hole of questioning this statement or his eligibility, but, well, what I know for certainty is that he's 100% disabled.

238
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:27.290
P10: So… two things. I could stop at this point, and then just call and verify.

239
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:33.519
P10: that all the systems are talking, and yes, he is… Indy is registered as 100% disabled.

240
00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.610
Moderator: Right.

241
00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.339
P10: But I'm not gonna do that, because…

242
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:52.079
P10: again, no need for a deep dive. This whole thing would have to be, like, declined, not eligible, like, shut me out the door for me to then go to Deere's and be like, hey, I just want to make sure that you guys accurately have my husband's disability rating at 100.

243
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.250
Moderator: Gotcha.

244
00:23:53.250 --> 00:24:06.789
P10: Because then I'm gonna question, if I already know two things, one, that I'm a spouse, and two, that I'm endears, but also three, that he is 100% disabled, there should be no reason why I don't qualify, because I have eligibility.

245
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:10.200
P10: So if I get a nod, then something's wrong.

246
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:11.530
Moderator: Optus.

247
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:20.340
Moderator: So does this system… does it feel like the system is helping you understand your option, or is the system blocking you from applying? Why?

248
00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:32.469
P10: No, it's not… it's not stopping me from blocking… I mean, it's not stopping me from, applying. I will continue, because in the end, there's still an option to continue.

249
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.439
P10: I didn't get this yellow box, and then it's the end.

250
00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.210
Moderator: I gotcha.

251
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:43.249
P10: So, there is still a box that says continue, so I will still continue.

252
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:46.540
Moderator: I gotcha. Alright, that makes sense.

253
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.370
Moderator: Thank you, and then go ahead and continue.

254
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:59.609
P10: If the veteran died, we'll ask more questions about those details. Answer to the best of your knowledge. Has…

255
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.179
P10: The veteran died. No.

256
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.290
P10: So, that's true.

257
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.320
P10: And I'm assuming that had you…

258
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.760
P10: Said yes, they would have asked for those additional details.

259
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:13.240
Moderator: Okay.

260
00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:14.929
Moderator: Go ahead and continue.

261
00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:26.580
P10: Alright, service-connected disability. Is the veteran permanently and totally disabled from a service Connected disability, Yes?

262
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:34.000
P10: How do we define service-connected disability? I guess if you would need more information?

263
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:42.189
P10: But typically, like, if you're at this point in your life with the VA, you kinda know…

264
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:49.020
P10: That your rating equals your disability-connected rating number, so…

265
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.359
Moderator: Gotcha. Alright, thank you. We can continue.

266
00:25:53.980 --> 00:26:01.000
P10: Eligibility for TRICARE. Is there veteran or any of the applicants eligible or enrolled in TRICARE?

267
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.830
P10: So…

268
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:16.090
P10: For us, it would be, yes, I have little kids, so yes, they are. How to check for… so I guess if you don't have it, it is saying you can check to see if you qualify for it.

269
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.800
P10: Okay. So, yeah, so us, we… this is correct, yes.

270
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.409
Moderator: Alright, and then go ahead and continue.

271
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.100
P10: Alright.

272
00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:33.620
P10: Based on the veteran's information, the applicant may not be eligible.

273
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.200
P10: Your response.

274
00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.499
P10: The veteran is permanently and totally…

275
00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.020
P10: Disabled from a service connected, or… A veteran…

276
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:49.689
P10: The ex is the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

277
00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:59.389
P10: If you didn't meet all the eligibility requirements for childhood benefits, you can exit this application.

278
00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.669
Moderator: Okay, so in your own word, what does this page mean?

279
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:18.739
P10: So, what I… At just a quick glance, it… the… the green… Check means yes.

280
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:30.850
P10: So I… I… which one can you identify with? The green check or the red X, right? So, if you can say yes to the green check.

281
00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:40.220
P10: Yes, my veteran is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected disability, or has died Blah blah blah.

282
00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:44.260
P10: This is saying you can hit continue.

283
00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:52.729
P10: But, you can exit the application if the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

284
00:27:53.150 --> 00:28:00.650
P10: If you didn't meet all the eligibility requirements for childhood benefits, you can exit this application.

285
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:10.700
Moderator: Okay, I just want to make sure if I understand you correctly. If you're eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMFA?

286
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:20.299
P10: Oh, well, according to this… Yes. So, it says the regiment applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

287
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.930
P10: So, but let's say you were eligible for TRICARE,

288
00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:33.000
P10: you can still get it, because wouldn't it just be… because I think that, for me, the red X means that he wasn't eligible for TRICARE.

289
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.170
Moderator: I gotcha.

290
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:41.650
P10: So that's how I'm reading it. I'm reading it as he did not qualify for TRICARE, and that's why there's a red X there.

291
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:46.140
Moderator: So you're expecting the red X to confirm that he's not eligible for TRICARE?

292
00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:53.300
P10: Yeah, exactly, but if he was, it would be a green check saying that, yes, he was.

293
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.880
Moderator: I gotcha.

294
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.780
Moderator: So, what is the system telling you about your eligibility, then?

295
00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:10.500
P10: Yeah, that's a really good question, because I don't really understand why there's two different red things there. But in my little silly head, just because it says continue, I'mma hit continue.

296
00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:11.690
Moderator: Gotcha.

297
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:16.560
P10: Confused in the… Your responses?

298
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:24.860
P10: It says, based on information, the applicant may not be eligible.

299
00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.259
P10: So, potentially, maybe I answered a question that

300
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.259
P10: said yes, but then maybe I answered a question that

301
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:43.130
P10: maybe not eligible? I don't know, maybe there's additional information that needs to be clarified or submitted to make both of them a go for me? I'm not sure.

302
00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:44.200
Moderator: Okay.

303
00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:54.059
P10: Because it says if you didn't meet all the eligibility requirements for CHAPA benefits, you can exit this application.

304
00:29:54.950 --> 00:30:06.990
P10: So this is a little bit wonky for me, too, because it's like, if you didn't meet ALL, meaning you don't have green checks across the whole thing, then you just need to exit now.

305
00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:08.800
Moderator: Gotcha.

306
00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:19.919
P10: I don't know, there's two different routes for me here. I'm like, well, maybe they need more information, and I need to continue, or maybe, because I got 1X, that means I am dropped. Exit the application.

307
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:25.860
Moderator: I gotcha. So you're reading it at two possible different directions, and can go either way.

308
00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.650
Moderator: And then in your mind, because of that, you're still gonna continue.

309
00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.250
Moderator: Yeah.

310
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.280
Moderator: Okay.

311
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:42.289
P10: Yeah, yeah, I'm still gonna continue, because now I'm curious, like, alright, well, what's the next screen, possibly? Is it needing more information to make this application a go, or is it gonna…

312
00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.499
P10: be another screen that says, this is why, or I don't know.

313
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:57.469
Moderator: Right. And then, so, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand the screen?

314
00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:12.060
P10: So I'm gonna give it a 1, because I'm not quite sure. I'm not quite sure of the clarity or the message. The message is just a lot of gray hair for me to be reading. I can go either way with this, depending on the user. I feel like…

315
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:18.059
P10: Your summary or your, received message could be different.

316
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:26.230
Moderator: Okay, thank you for that. And then we can go ahead and press continue here. It will take you back to the beginning of that prototype.

317
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:41.140
Moderator: And then now we're gonna switch gears and look through a second prototype. This, like I mentioned earlier, this is a prototype, so not everything works, the way you expect it to. Go ahead and click on Prototype Blueberry, so the first one.

318
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:50.869
Moderator: And then for this one, you can just scroll down to the bottom, because this is the same page as before, and then you are going to click in within that blue box down there.

319
00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:55.180
Moderator: in the Start Your Own form without signing in.

320
00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:09.559
Moderator: Alright, and then, like before, please go through these few questions, and then remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here, and then when you're ready, click continue.

321
00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:15.770
P10: Alright, so eligibility information. First of all, ask your questions to make sure you're eligible, which is great.

322
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:19.419
P10: We'll use veterinary information to confirm eligibility.

323
00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:34.169
P10: Alright, you must meet all the eligibility requirements for CHAPA if you're not eligible and submit an application, you're… this delay benefits for other applicants. I'm assuming they don't want you to bombard this system, but…

324
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:46.899
P10: Okay, eligibility information. Which of these best describes you? I am a spouse, dependent, survivor of a veteran applying.

325
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:49.240
P10: For benefits for myself.

326
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.690
P10: I am a veteran applying for benefits.

327
00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:59.540
P10: for my spouse dependents, or both, I am applying for benefits on behalf of

328
00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.870
P10: Yeah, so I am a spouse, this is correct.

329
00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:09.360
P10: Alright.

330
00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:25.090
P10: veterans… Name, date of birth, all his information, his… Social, birthday, Okay, pretty.

331
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:26.480
P10: Do you stand?

332
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.860
Moderator: Yeah.

333
00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.330
P10: Looks good.

334
00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.060
P10: If the veteran has died, we'll ask more questions.

335
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:39.290
P10: No, he has not died, so we'll continue.

336
00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.780
P10: Is a veteran permanently and totally disabled from service-connected?

337
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.689
P10: disability, Yes, he is.

338
00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:07.939
P10: Is the… is the veteran or any of the applicants eligible or enrolled in TRICARE, Department of Defense Health Care Program for Service Members and their families?

339
00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.159
P10: This one is checked no.

340
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:17.050
P10: So… but we have it, I don't know if that matters, but no, okay.

341
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.139
Moderator: Right. For this scenario, we'll go with no.

342
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:21.989
P10: No…

343
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:36.959
P10: Which is just real quick, wait, is the veteran or any of the applicants eligible or enrolled in TRICARE? Okay, it says any, because sometimes I'm like, well, welding for, like, half the family is, but it says any, so…

344
00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:42.149
P10: Okay. Oh, a god dang.

345
00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:49.069
P10: Oh wait, so now I get green star… I mean, green checks.

346
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:59.370
P10: So, now looking at this one, now I know… That… if you don't have…

347
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:04.330
P10: TRICARE, then I'm gonna get a… a green check.

348
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:14.050
P10: So, it says, based on their veteran's information and applicants and information, the applicant may be eligible. Okay.

349
00:35:14.290 --> 00:35:21.139
P10: If you didn't meet… so we did, because now we got all checks. So I'm assuming now…

350
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:24.290
P10: that I read the previous one wrong.

351
00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:30.859
P10: Because it's saying that I didn't…

352
00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:43.009
P10: not eligible child care. So I guess you can't have both. If you meet all the eligibility requirements, or think the applicants may be still eligible, please click Continue.

353
00:35:44.210 --> 00:35:44.740
P10: The bump.

354
00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:45.220
Moderator: So…

355
00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:46.779
P10: bleed the application.

356
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.509
Moderator: Would you take the sand?

357
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:54.339
Moderator: Different actions compared to the other previous prototype.

358
00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:59.120
Moderator: In the previous one, you just continued. This one, you will continue, then?

359
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.560
P10: Yeah, because nothing is even making me…

360
00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:06.390
P10: second-guess anything, because now it's, like, all… all green, all goes.

361
00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:16.090
Moderator: I gotcha. So, because the previous one, you're unsure, but you'll continue. Whereas this one, you're a lot more confident in the, in the systems.

362
00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:34.090
P10: Exactly. This one, I am confident, and I didn't get no… I didn't get any red X's, because, again, we're conditioned that red bad, or X means stop, and that's another thing. I mean, in a normal word, I think that X would tell somebody, well, you got an X, that means stop.

363
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:45.439
Moderator: And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand the second prototype?

364
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.999
P10: So this one, it makes sense.

365
00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:54.619
P10: What'd you say the numbers were?

366
00:36:54.620 --> 00:37:00.120
Moderator: 5 being, sorry, 1 being very hard, and then 5 being, very easy.

367
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:10.160
P10: Well, I'm gonna say 3, and I'm only gonna say 3 only because clarity has hit me. Only because now I see that you have… you can't have TRICARE.

368
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.370
P10: with this.

369
00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:12.730
Moderator: I gotcha.

370
00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:19.930
P10: But I think had I known, or maybe I had better read and understand, you cannot have TRICARE,

371
00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:27.120
P10: that this first prototype would have made sense, because I would be like, well, I hit that I had TRICARE, and that's why I'm getting the red X.

372
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:34.310
P10: So, obviously, I think… In the end, this is definitely a user error here, being me.

373
00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:39.879
Moderator: And then, comparing the two prototypes, which one would you prefer to use?

374
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:46.179
P10: I… for me, they were both the same.

375
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:48.640
Moderator: Okay, so no preference, really.

376
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:55.870
P10: No preference. Think they were both the same. I think that… Maybe…

377
00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:05.549
P10: In the eligibility requirements, in the very beginning of this, it said, you know, you had to be a service member.

378
00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.320
P10: Before the application part, I'm saying. Before that part.

379
00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.190
Moderator: Right, right.

380
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:19.669
P10: first screen we had looked at, and it… for me, it was straight clarity. You need to be a spouse-dependent, veteran of…

381
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:22.269
P10: I mean, it's whatever, of a veteran.

382
00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:27.360
P10: Who is, 100% disabled or has passed away.

383
00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:36.650
P10: But I don't remember seeing anything that mentioned TRICARE.

384
00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:38.670
Moderator: I gotcha.

385
00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:40.360
P10: Not in the very beginning.

386
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.130
Moderator: Okay.

387
00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:43.540
P10: It could have been an oversight on my part.

388
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.500
Moderator: I gotcha.

389
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.919
P10: But I think that that needs to be plain and clear.

390
00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:56.750
P10: as plain and clear it is about being 100% disabled, needs to also say, you can't double dip, you can't have this and TRICARE.

391
00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:57.960
Moderator: Gotcha.

392
00:38:58.770 --> 00:38:59.890
Moderator: And then…

393
00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:07.300
Moderator: Thinking about everything that you just saw, was there too much, too little, or about the right amount of information?

394
00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:20.460
P10: I mean, for me, it was between the two prototypes. They were… for me, it was very… it was the same. It was just an aha moment for me in regards to the TRICARE question.

395
00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.380
P10: But… and again, I don't know if it was just… it was there, and I… it was the oversight, and I didn't see it.

396
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:26.290
Moderator: Gotcha.

397
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:31.009
P10: I don't know, I can't… I can't remember the very beginning of it, but,

398
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:38.970
P10: I think that that needs to be just as important or highlighted in the eligibility portion of it.

399
00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:42.040
P10: Before you start the application part of it.

400
00:39:42.250 --> 00:39:49.889
P10: Because… Yeah, I got 2 different,

401
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:53.659
P10: Results, but it was only because of…

402
00:39:53.930 --> 00:40:01.160
P10: a lack of understanding of TRICARE, eligibility in… So, yeah.

403
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:06.999
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, if you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident in doing so?

404
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:08.739
P10: No, not at all.

405
00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.680
Moderator: Okay.

406
00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:22.379
P10: I would definitely say, hey, go to… re… go to the, you know, at first, I would always say go to the information screen, right? Get a better understanding of it before you really,

407
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:30.769
P10: Okay, so I would always… for anything, because I have a daughter with autism, so I deep dive everything, but I would first say, learn… read about the program.

408
00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.049
P10: What is it, right?

409
00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:37.309
P10: To who's eligible, because that's really important.

410
00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:48.009
P10: And then… and THEN apply. But I think that eligibility is so important before, you know, understanding that part of it.

411
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.010
Moderator: Right.

412
00:40:49.220 --> 00:41:02.590
Moderator: That makes sense. Okay, we can continue, and that will take you back to the beginning of the prototype here, and if you screw around to the bottom, you'll see a couple of different options here.

413
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:15.229
Moderator: And then what we'll do now is we'll take a look at some scenario and the messagings, and then I just want your feedback on that. So there's two buttons here, we'll go ahead and start with the warning alerts.

414
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:34.279
Moderator: And then I'll read you a scenario, and then you'll review the message and state any kind of questions you may have, or feedback that you could provide. So, for Alert A, after you enter the veteran's information, you see this message. Like I mentioned, please think out loud and kind of go through your thought as you're reading this information.

415
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:43.810
P10: We can't confirm the eligibility of the applicants right now. We couldn't find the veteran's information in our system. If you think this is an error, check the information you enter.

416
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:47.390
P10: So I would go back and make sure…

417
00:41:48.130 --> 00:41:51.470
P10: that I entered in the correct information.

418
00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.099
P10: If that was a possibility. I don't know if…

419
00:41:55.230 --> 00:42:06.249
P10: visibly, like, what all I can see, because sometimes when you enter in something, you hit submit, it is gone in the wind, and there's no going back, so I don't know what I entered. Maybe I hit a 3 instead of a 5.

420
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:12.180
P10: So, if I'm able… To… if there was, like, a…

421
00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:30.750
P10: generated message that can show me my error, like, the number, like, we cannot confirm the eligibility, or… like, say I submitted application, and I… I got an email saying, you submitted this application, this is the number, whatever, and then I… and then I got this email, then I would go back to said email to make sure I put the right number in.

422
00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:35.229
P10: But say I didn't have anything to go back on it, I might do it again.

423
00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:36.480
Moderator: Gotcha.

424
00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:43.170
Moderator: And then, in this scenario, would you want to apply for the Champa benefit despite seeing this warning?

425
00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:48.219
P10: Yeah, because it could be user error, it could have been me entering the wrong number.

426
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:49.480
Moderator: Gotcha.

427
00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:49.870
P10: birthday.

428
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:50.450
Moderator: Alright?

429
00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:58.599
Moderator: That makes sense. And then for, Alert B, same scenario, you enter the veteran's information, and then you see this message.

430
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:06.109
P10: We can't confirm the eligibility of the applicants right now. You can try again later, or select continue to complete.

431
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:10.070
P10: your application. Complete your application.

432
00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.320
P10: I would try again later.

433
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.960
Moderator: Can you kind of go through your thought process on that?

434
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:27.170
P10: I would try again later, because I wouldn't want to hit continue, if…

435
00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.099
P10: They couldn't confirm his eligibility to begin with.

436
00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:31.720
Moderator: Gotcha.

437
00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:37.449
P10: So I just feel like that would… for me, that has to be a green check, and then I would move on with it.

438
00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:38.900
Moderator: Okay.

439
00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:48.750
Moderator: And then go ahead and scroll down to the third scenario, or the alert C. Same thing, you've entered the veteran's information, and you see this message.

440
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:56.630
P10: And we can't confirm the eligibility of the applicant right now. If you think this is an error, check the information you entered, or select…

441
00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.810
P10: Continue to complete your application.

442
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:19.019
P10: Yeah, definitely. I would just definitely go back and make sure that the information I did enter… entered was correct, because we're human, or, you know, fat fingers, or whatever, or I… sometimes I mess up my kids' dates, or whatever, so… I would just check to just kind of make sure that it is correct.

443
00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:23.630
P10: And in this scenario, if it is correct.

444
00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:27.259
P10: I would then just hit continue.

445
00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:36.689
P10: And just kind of see where that went, because at the end of the day, I think that no matter what, eligibility has to be confirmed at some point.

446
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:37.300
Moderator: Gotcha.

447
00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.700
P10: So, we'll see.

448
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.850
Moderator: Okay.

449
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:45.469
Moderator: And then, same thing with Alert D, enter Veterans Information, then you see this.

450
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:55.040
P10: Based on the veteran's information, applicants may not be eligible for TAMP benefits. We found the veteran's information in the DEERS for TRICARE benefits. If

451
00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:05.420
P10: Even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHABA benefits if You… if you're eligible for… TRICARE.

452
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:10.769
P10: This is a word, it's so confusing to me.

453
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:15.910
Moderator: I gotta read it twice just to break it down in my own stinkin' head, because in my head…

454
00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:23.589
P10: In my head, I want to say the two go together, right? I don't know why I want to think that, but okay. So…

455
00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:29.439
P10: Alright, so we found the information in Deers, so that's good. He is in DEERS.

456
00:45:29.650 --> 00:45:32.919
P10: For TRICARE benefits. So, yes, he…

457
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:42.040
P10: is eligible for TRICARE benefits. Even if you aren't enrolled, meaning whether he is, Or isn't?

458
00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:56.100
P10: enrolled in TRICARE, you are not eligible for CHAPA benefits, even if… even if you're eligible for TRICARE. So just because we, he, or whatever is eligible for TRICARE,

459
00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.609
P10: Does not entitle… make us eligible.

460
00:46:00.850 --> 00:46:03.160
P10: Or automatically make us eligible?

461
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.139
P10: For Choppa?

462
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:12.379
Moderator: Okay, so the wording here definitely makes you hesitate in making sure it aligns in your head.

463
00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:20.070
P10: you… yes, if you aren't eligible for CHAPA benefits, If you're eligible for TRICARE,

464
00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.940
P10: So, if you are eligible for TRICARE,

465
00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:25.570
P10: You are not eligible for CHAPA.

466
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:31.359
P10: I don't really like the wording. It's very confusing. I have to read it, like, twice in my head.

467
00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.320
Moderator: Gotcha.

468
00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:36.619
Moderator: And then, if you see this message, what would you do?

469
00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:51.630
P10: I would actually go, like, way back. I have to, like, pause this for a second, because now I have to really deep dive CHAPA benefits, the eligibility, and probably me, my head, I would probably go to…

470
00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.600
P10: That website, or wherever, to…

471
00:46:55.410 --> 00:47:02.359
Moderator: and asked a question, or, like, she asked questions, or like, okay, I just want to confirm, just because he's…

472
00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:06.509
P10: can get TRICARE, he cannot get Chopper, or something to that effect.

473
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:11.030
Moderator: So, is there any kind of additional information that you would want here, then?

474
00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.870
P10: I don't… I mean…

475
00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:27.310
P10: No, I don't think here. I mean, maybe a link or some kind of direction as, well, here's additional information.

476
00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:30.790
P10: for better understanding why you're not eligible? I don't know.

477
00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:31.470
Moderator: Okay.

478
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:34.050
P10: Because I think that…

479
00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:43.750
P10: I'm gonna go do that anyway, I'm gonna go find that, so if you just wanna just put it there for me, to just click, to say, this is why you're not eligible, because you have TRICARE, or…

480
00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.190
Moderator: Gotcha.

481
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:55.779
Moderator: And then across all the alerts that you saw, how confident do you feel, that you know what to do? 1… or one, not very confident, and then five, being very confident.

482
00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:02.840
P10: I would say 3. I kind of feel like in some of the learns, I'm like, alright, I can just try back later, because that's what it told me to do.

483
00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:03.420
Moderator: Yeah.

484
00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:10.250
P10: So some of them it was fine, and then the D one was just a little wonky for me, because I had to read it, like, 4 times in my head.

485
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:11.070
Moderator: Gotcha.

486
00:48:11.070 --> 00:48:24.059
P10: But after the fourth time, okay, I think it's… I think I'm understanding the alert, but I'm still gonna go to the websites of CHAP of Benefits, or TRICARE, or Department of Defense, or wherever I need to find that information.

487
00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:33.060
P10: That it says to me, because you are… you qualify for TRICARE, you are not eligible for CHAPA.

488
00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:39.299
Moderator: Alright, and then I think we have one alert last, or last alert here, the alert E.

489
00:48:42.130 --> 00:48:46.229
P10: Based on the veteran's information, the applicants may be eligible.

490
00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:49.410
P10: Board Chopper, please continue to plead.

491
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.650
P10: Okay, so I would hit continue.

492
00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:53.050
Moderator: It's plaintool.

493
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.010
Moderator: Gotcha. Go ahead and click on…

494
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.670
P10: So…

495
00:48:55.810 --> 00:49:01.509
Moderator: That's right. Go ahead and click on there, and then we'll go back to here, scroll down a little bit.

496
00:49:01.890 --> 00:49:05.240
Moderator: And then we have our final task here, is the card summary.

497
00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:23.960
Moderator: So, for this, on the screen, you'll find four different summary cards. The first two, card style A, are from the prototype we just went through, and then the third and fourth card, card style B, are alternative designs, so please take a few moments to look at all four, and then I have a couple questions for you.

498
00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:30.110
P10: Alright, Carstart A, based on a veteran's information, applicant may be eligible.

499
00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:37.660
P10: may be eligible… If you got these green checks, the veteran is permanently and totally…

500
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:49.979
P10: Disabled from service-connected disability, or the veteran died from the service-connected disability, or the veteran at the time of their death was rated permanently and totally okay.

501
00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:56.160
P10: Also, the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE. Okay.

502
00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:00.479
P10: appreciating that. Plain and simple, that's what I needed to hear.

503
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:11.489
P10: Because if you are… if you qualify, if you are eligible for child care, then you need to go over there. Okay, second card…

504
00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:16.759
P10: The veteran is…

505
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:25.340
P10: Okay, so the second card, it says, may not be eligible.

506
00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.810
P10: And the difference is the veteran applicant is not

507
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.770
P10: Wait a second, what?

508
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:44.390
P10: I'm so confused. The veteran or applicant is not eligible for CHRICARE, the veteran or applicant is not eligible for CHRICARE.

509
00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.420
P10: Are you, what in the trickness is going on here?

510
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:51.030
P10: What?

511
00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:53.790
Moderator: Okay.

512
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:59.369
Moderator: And then… So you're seeing some awkwardness there.

513
00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.990
Moderator: Go ahead and continue to the next one.

514
00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:11.680
P10: So, like, the X's and checks, I don't really know what they even mean anymore. Because here are my card A, number 1, this one.

515
00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.079
P10: I'm like, okay, this is great!

516
00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:21.599
P10: The veteran or applicant is NOT eligible for child care. My husband's not, we can't get it, whatever, not, right?

517
00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:22.230
Moderator: Right.

518
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:23.860
P10: may be eligible!

519
00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:25.980
P10: Maybe. Okay.

520
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:26.560
Moderator: Okay.

521
00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:29.590
P10: Then I go over here, based on

522
00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:33.349
P10: information the applicant may NOT be.

523
00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:46.759
P10: But what… why is… why… why it may… may not be eligible? And why am I getting two different X's here? I mean, why am I getting an X and a…

524
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:57.409
Moderator: Okay, so what you're seeing is, I'm gonna put it in my own words here, a double negative, and that's confusing you. Is that… does that sound correctly?

525
00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:14.019
P10: This is very confusing to me, and what's confusing, and it's so silly, I know, but we're conditioned, again, for these reds and these greens and these checks and whatever. So, just at a glance, which is human nature, you see this, you think something's wrong.

526
00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:15.560
Moderator: Right.

527
00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:16.930
Moderator: And then I want you to…

528
00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:24.170
P10: question your life, because you're like, well, same sentence? Yeah. Why am I getting two different… Right?

529
00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:25.050
Moderator: Right?

530
00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:25.980
P10: Okay.

531
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:31.920
Moderator: And then I want you to scroll down to cardstyle B and review those two, or look at those two.

532
00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:40.659
P10: Okay. The responses meet all the eligibility requirements for CHOPA.

533
00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:47.349
P10: Veteran at the time of the bill… yes.

534
00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.770
P10: The veteran or applicant is not eligible.

535
00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:10.879
P10: Okay, so the second one, it says, it's this one, the response didn't meet all the eligibility requirements.

536
00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:22.390
P10: I just scrolled up real quick, because I had to see the difference. So, on here, it says your responses met all the eligibility requirements, and then this one is not there.

537
00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:29.409
P10: And then this one… Your response is…

538
00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.080
P10: Didn't meet all the eligibility requirements.

539
00:53:33.590 --> 00:53:38.559
P10: And I'm assuming that this one didn't meet the eligibility requirement.

540
00:53:41.490 --> 00:53:44.330
P10: The veteran applicant is eligible for child care.

541
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:50.429
P10: I'm not even gonna lie, I'm totally confused. I don't even know what I'm looking at anymore, just…

542
00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:51.510
Moderator: Okay, okay.

543
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:52.020
P10: codes.

544
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:52.630
Moderator: Okay.

545
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.890
Moderator: So, what do you think each car is telling you?

546
00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:05.170
P10: I don't even know what each card is telling me, so I'm actually reading it head to toe, because one is basically saying to me.

547
00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:15.660
P10: Your responses meet all the eligibility requirements for CHAPA. Next card, your responses didn't meet all the eligibility requirements.

548
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:25.020
Moderator: Gotcha. I just want to note that we're almost at time here, and is it okay if we get another 5 extra minutes with you?

549
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:25.940
P10: That's fine.

550
00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:27.149
Moderator: Alright, thank you.

551
00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:36.009
P10: Okay. So, that's a little confusing, right? Like, I'm like, okay… I think what's throwing me off is…

552
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.390
P10: The… these differences?

553
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:45.090
P10: Because in one, I'm like, I'm good, the next one, I'm not.

554
00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:48.230
P10: Didn't meet it, but then I met it, so…

555
00:54:49.770 --> 00:54:54.170
P10: the veteran… I'm just gonna read these, maybe I'm not meeting it here, I don't know.

556
00:54:55.130 --> 00:55:04.649
P10: I feel like this is totally unrelated, we can have 10 minutes if you want. I feel like I'm in an escape room, and I'm just not figuring out the way out of here. That's how I feel right now.

557
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:05.110
Moderator: Okay.

558
00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:06.620
P10: So…

559
00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:14.939
Moderator: No worries. That's the whole point of this, is to understand, or to try to see if, what makes sense and what doesn't make sense to you.

560
00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:20.380
Moderator: So, what is the easiest set, for you to understand at a glance, then?

561
00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:38.329
P10: I think in any eligibility or any application, we, again, are conditioned. Like, there's… we can go through so many applications, and typically in any application, any green means go, or any checkmark means something has been completed.

562
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:45.120
P10: So, instinctively in my head, the red means that…

563
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:47.139
P10: This is the end for me.

564
00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:53.100
P10: Or, not to proceed with application?

565
00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:04.799
Moderator: So, do you have a preference for one style or the other style, in terms of these two different card styles?

566
00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:08.130
Moderator: The first two pair, or the second tube?

567
00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:14.629
P10: I like the second set, and the only reason why I like the second set is because of this…

568
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:15.900
P10: this…

569
00:56:16.330 --> 00:56:26.430
P10: these two lines right here, where it says your responses didn't meet, because that makes it plain and simple, it did not meet it. And up here.

570
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:31.400
P10: it didn't… it didn't… I mean, it says…

571
00:56:31.950 --> 00:56:44.860
P10: if you read it, based on a veteran's information application, may not be, and so that may not be really, like, I don't know. But then when I go down here, your responses didn't meet.

572
00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:49.739
P10: And so, this is gray to me, this is black and white, you didn't meet it.

573
00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:59.069
Moderator: Okay, so you like that definitive, kind of, definitive card there, or the definitive, response.

574
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:07.629
P10: Definitely, definitely. Like, clear words, clear expectations, clear understanding. You do not need it Here you are.

575
00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:12.829
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, is there any other part of the car that felt confusing or unclear?

576
00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:22.970
P10: I mean… I don't know, I think it's fine.

577
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.100
P10: The card is fine.

578
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:25.550
Moderator: Okay.

579
00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:36.010
P10: I think, and I don't know how important or not this is, but… The veteran died…

580
00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:44.019
P10: No, sorry. The veteran is permanently or totally disabled from a service-connected disability. I think that…

581
00:57:45.250 --> 00:57:56.910
P10: In that card, it should specify 100% totally disabled from a service-connected disability. There are many service members who have service-connected disabilities.

582
00:57:56.910 --> 00:58:05.330
P10: And they might have a total, like, they lost their leg, but that doesn't mean that they're 100% disabled and qualified.

583
00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:06.800
Moderator: I gotcha.

584
00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.839
P10: Thank you for that clarification.

585
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:15.499
Moderator: Or in feedback. And that's the end of the screen share, so you can stop the screen share.

586
00:58:16.070 --> 00:58:17.060
P10: That was crazy.

587
00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:26.729
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. Was there any other feedback you'd like to add about the two prototypes and the messages you saw today?

588
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:36.630
P10: No, I mean, I think that… I think anything military-related, it… There should just be,

589
00:58:36.830 --> 00:58:41.810
P10: You know, information that's easy, accessibly, like, accessible right there.

590
00:58:42.490 --> 00:58:46.340
P10: So now, whether it's a hyperlink to it, or…

591
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:55.540
P10: shortly down the page, why are you not eligible? Or whatever. Right. Because a lot of times I've applied things through the VA, and…

592
00:58:55.650 --> 00:59:06.120
P10: or just TRICARE, or just military-related, and it's… you have to literally deep dive TRICARE.com to really find answers, and I hate that.

593
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:10.279
P10: Clarity and clear talk is just… it's just better, man, but…

594
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:17.019
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to, like, an online form?

595
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:36.880
P10: No, I think that… I think that is pretty sufficient to say, okay, here's your, you know, your spouse's information, because everything is registered under them anyway, but I think that I should be clear on that, yes, eligibility is met, or no, or additional information… oh, whatever, and I'm sure that that's a whole thing.

596
00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.510
Moderator: Okay.

597
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:44.610
P10: But, I think even before you apply, it should be a solid understanding of what you're applying for.

598
00:59:46.570 --> 00:59:54.220
Moderator: Gotcha. Let me see if I have… if the observers have any questions. And then, in the meantime, do you have any questions for me?

599
00:59:56.420 --> 01:00:05.390
Moderator: Alright, then I would like to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable, or would decide to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.

600
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:06.540
P10: That's fine.

601
01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:19.310
Moderator: Okay, and just to remind you, we do remove any kind of information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and then this is only for the purpose of improving the VA.gov and other digital experience.

602
01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:31.399
Moderator: And then, like I said, we appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback's been super helpful for us to kind of continue the work on the VA.gov and digital products.

603
01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.319
P10: I hope so, because goodness.

604
01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:47.579
Moderator: And then lastly, Preogen will send you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans and their family members to kind of participate in, like, future research studies like this. Okay.

605
01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:49.909
Moderator: Thank you, and have a great day!

606
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:52.029
P10: Thank you, you too, bye-bye.

607
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:52.690
Moderator: Bye-bye.
