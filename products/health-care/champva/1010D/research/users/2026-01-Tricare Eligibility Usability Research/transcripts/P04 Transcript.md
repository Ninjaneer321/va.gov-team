00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:08.440
Moderator: I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.580
P4: Yeah, that's fine.

3
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:19.709
Moderator: Alright, and then are you comfortable? We decided to use a recorded clip, for our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you.

4
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.740
P4: Yes.

5
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.780
Moderator: All right, thank you, and that's the end of the boilerplates. We can start on the…

6
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:38.479
Moderator: the research. So I got a few warm-up questions for you. Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veteran Affairs, aka the CHAMPA program?

7
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.770
P4: No, I have not.

8
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.399
Moderator: Okay? And then, have you ever heard of Champa program before?

9
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.430
P4: I have. My mother uses it with, her husband.

10
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.610
Moderator: I see.

11
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.140
Moderator: And then, are you able to, in your own word, explain what you know about the eligibility of that program?

12
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:10.149
P4: So from what I'm tracking, you're only eligible for it if you are, 100% permanent and total, or if your permanent and total

13
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:19.780
P4: and TDIU, but not 100%, so you specifically apply for TDIU status. So it's reserved for only those that are permanent and total.

14
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.870
Moderator: I see.

15
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.470
P4: That's what I'm tracking of it.

16
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.319
Moderator: Okay, and then have you ever heard of TRICARE?

17
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.219
P4: Yes, of course.

18
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.880
Moderator: Okay, and then can you explain the difference between TRICARE and CHAMPA?

19
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:42.139
P4: I… I wish I could give you an honest answer about that, but I can only tell you what I think I know of it. So what I think I know of it is that

20
00:01:42.510 --> 00:02:00.529
P4: TRICARE… TRICARE's the insurance that just works. It does everything. It's a primary insurance, and from what I understand of CHAMPVA, CHAMPVA is a secondary insurance that works with your already existing insurance as, like, a backup?

21
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.860
P4: I know that…

22
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:19.469
P4: from what I understand, if you become, like, say, for instance, I was working somewhere, and my job offered me insurance, and I was on their insurance policy, and then my disability rating made me eligible for CHAMPVA, I can't…

23
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:30.229
P4: discard my current insurance, and just have CHAMP VA. I'm told it doesn't work that way. I gotcha. So, again, I can't say that I know a ton about it.

24
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.109
Moderator: Right, but that's your understanding of it.

25
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.820
P4: Correct.

26
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:45.130
Moderator: Thank you for that. So today, we'll jump right into the prototype here. I do have a couple of links, and then I just want to confirm that, to see if I get it right. You are using mobile, is that correct?

27
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.790
P4: Yeah, it said to use my phone, so I mean, I could use a laptop, I'm…

28
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.979
Moderator: No, that's fine. We have mobile set up as well.

29
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.360
P4: Okay.

30
00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:03.260
Moderator: So I'm gonna share a link on, in chat with you of the mobile, and then I'd like you to basically open it in your browser, and then share it with,

31
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.390
Moderator: Share your screen with us as you go through it.

32
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.480
P4: Too easy.

33
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.849
Moderator: Alright, sounds good. I'll link it over here.

34
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.089
Moderator: And then, the link is in chat, let me know if you're able to see that.

35
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.749
P4: Yep, I'm on it, it's loading.

36
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.189
Moderator: Okay, great. And then, when you're open that, and it's,

37
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.020
Moderator: loaded, please go ahead and share your screen with us.

38
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:40.029
P4: Okay, let me… more… Share Share screen…

39
00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.450
P4: Start broadcast, let me know if you're getting my screen.

40
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.100
Moderator: I do see the broad, screen… screen broadcast.

41
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.380
P4: Okay.

42
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.209
P4: So let's go here.

43
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.420
Moderator: I do see it, alright, perfect.

44
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.790
P4: Oops.

45
00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:05.909
P4: I was trying to minimize There we go. Alright, so I am here. Blueberry or pineapple? Okay.

46
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:24.300
Moderator: Okay, great. So, for the first task, we are gonna take you through pineapple first. Go ahead and click on pineapple. So, on this first page, please take a minute or so to look over the instructions, and then when you're ready, in your own words, please tell me what this means to you.

47
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:35.520
P4: Okay, so this looks like the standard VA website, basically, it goes over…

48
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.390
P4: Champ VA in how to apply for it if you're the spouse. So this… Survivor, veteran?

49
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.879
P4: So this looks like this could be something for dependents to apply for CHAMP VA, not necessarily the veteran.

50
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.160
Moderator: Okay.

51
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.690
Moderator: And then, in your own word, what is this application for?

52
00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:16.349
P4: Well, this will tell me, if I'm eligible, or if my dependent is eligible for CHAMP VA, and they'll do a couple of things. And then it tells me what documentation that I will need. I can click on it to find out more documents, and it does look like

53
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.630
P4: Step 3 will let me start an application if I'm signed in with my ID.me.

54
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.159
Moderator: Okay, and then who is eligible to apply?

55
00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:38.029
P4: Eligible applicants are families or, dependents of veterans that are considered 100% permanent and total.

56
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:46.100
P4: Who meet certain requirements, qualify, so… let's age… Yeah.

57
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.230
Moderator: Okay.

58
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.699
Moderator: And then, is there anything here that makes you uncertain about applying?

59
00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:05.669
P4: No, I don't see… it's all pretty straightforward, because if I was… if I needed more information, I can click find out more information, I could see what other documents I would need, so if I was applying…

60
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.580
P4: for it, I would… This tool would be useful.

61
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:18.790
Moderator: Okay, and then if you are applying for Rio, would you continue, or would you want to, want more information first?

62
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:31.489
P4: I would… well, I would click sign in, create… and sign into my account, or I'd have my wife sign into her account, and then I would probably check,

63
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.720
P4: eligibility first, and make sure I had all of my documents, and then I would start the application.

64
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:49.750
Moderator: Okay, and then I believe you mentioned that you want to check eligibility first, so can we, can you scroll up to the top there at number 1, and go ahead and click on that, link? Yeah.

65
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.140
Moderator: And then… Kind of go through this, page real quick.

66
00:06:55.290 --> 00:07:01.860
P4: Shows everything. Eligibility for specific groups, different benefits you can get from Champ VA.

67
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.210
P4: There's… see the how to apply for benefits? There's a typo.

68
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.729
Moderator: Okay, I see that. Thank you.

69
00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.569
P4: I know that's probably not something…

70
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.390
P4: That this… what this is for, but…

71
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.390
P4: I have OCD, so that would be something that would

72
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.300
P4: irritate me, I would focus on that.

73
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:34.600
Moderator: It's good, because we're constantly seeing this, so we might miss it, but, like, you know, a pair of fresh eyes always…

74
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.359
Moderator: Good to, good to point that out.

75
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:45.249
P4: Here's the… Eligibility, the primary eligibility information,

76
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:55.099
P4: you know, if somebody died of a service-connected disability. You know, the only thing it doesn't tell you is,

77
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.310
P4: what that…

78
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:09.179
P4: VA eligibility is. It doesn't tell you on here, like, if you… you have to be TDIU, or you have to be 100% permanent total, because I know there's a difference

79
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:23.840
P4: between being TDIU and being 100% permanent and total, it's a subtle difference. But from what I understand, because Bob is TDIU, his decision letter says basic eligibility for CHAMP VA.

80
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:26.710
Moderator: I gotcha. You want that Pacific.

81
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.170
P4: They'll say the same thing.

82
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.270
Moderator: I gotcha.

83
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:36.320
P4: But if somebody didn't know, because they're not… Educated in decision letters.

84
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.230
P4: Then they could get their information from this.

85
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.210
P4: Right here, and then they could apply.

86
00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:52.239
Moderator: I gotcha. Alright, thank you. And then you can click on that orange button that says return to, prototype. Alright, we're back here. And then on this page here,

87
00:08:52.649 --> 00:09:02.829
Moderator: On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

88
00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.440
P4: Well, four and a half.

89
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.770
Moderator: Yeah, strong 4.

90
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.650
Moderator: Why do you give it that rating?

91
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:22.790
P4: It has everything on there, except for… and it does have the link, but it doesn't go in to tell you, like, what your ratings have to be to find out

92
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:31.640
P4: If you do qualify, but it does give you access to the information. If the information was on this page, I'd give it a 5.

93
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.190
Moderator: I gotcha. So you want that extra bit of information there.

94
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:41.110
P4: Instead of looking at a page to take you to another page, to take you to another page.

95
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:45.730
P4: Just put it on there, because someone… my…

96
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:51.900
P4: someone might be 80% permanent in total, but not TDIU.

97
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.870
P4: And not qualify, but not know it.

98
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:58.069
Moderator: I gotcha.

99
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.760
P4: Don't know.

100
00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:06.889
Moderator: Alright, that makes sense. We'll go ahead and proceed to the next, portion here, the next task. Go ahead and scroll down to the bottom…

101
00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.850
Moderator: That… this one? Oh.

102
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.880
P4: Oops.

103
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.570
Moderator: You're, you're good. We're meant to be here. So…

104
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:20.750
Moderator: what we're gonna do is, a few of this page has been kind of pre-filled for you. Go ahead and

105
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:41.280
Moderator: go through this. I just want to note that this is a prototype, so it's not like you can type things in here, but it's for you to look at and give us feedback. Please go through the next few questions, and remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thought on the content and information here, and then click continue when you're ready to proceed to the next page.

106
00:10:41.890 --> 00:11:00.040
P4: Okay, so the first thing it's gonna do is check your eligibility. It's gonna ask me some questions to make sure I'm even eligible for CHAMPVA. Well, if the dependent is eligible, it looks like that all of this is speaking to the dependent and not the veteran.

107
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:20.109
P4: I'm going to use the information for eligibility, you must meet all eligibility requirements for CHAMP VA. If you're not eligible and submit an application, this may delay benefits for other applicants. Basically saying, if you don't qualify, don't apply, because you're gonna add more problems to the pipeline.

108
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.510
Moderator: That makes sense to me. Alright.

109
00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:33.340
P4: Alright, so… Here we go. So this is the first time I'm seeing, from the veteran's perspective.

110
00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.589
P4: I'm a veteran applying for benefits from my spouse dependents, or both.

111
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.899
Moderator: Straightforward for you?

112
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.190
P4: Pretty straightforward.

113
00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.080
Moderator: Okay.

114
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:53.110
P4: And then, I'm Riley Smith, and…

115
00:11:53.650 --> 00:12:00.369
P4: There's all my information, all my demographic information… Pretty straightforward, imported.

116
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.289
P4: from… Oh, look, it says no, you're not eligible.

117
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.279
Moderator: And then, how do you feel about the way this application, checked your eligibility here?

118
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:27.749
P4: Okay, it's pretty good. It gives the information, it says… basically, it's saying that this veteran is not…

119
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.860
P4: Doesn't have any dependents that are eligible.

120
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:50.230
P4: for Champ VA because they were in DEERS already, enrolled for TRICARE benefits, so maybe this person's in the Guard, or they're a dependent of a service member still, or some other reason that they're enrolled in TRICARE.

121
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:55.189
Moderator: I see. And then, does this feel helpful, intrusive, or something else?

122
00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.110
P4: It's informative, it's not intrusive or anything,

123
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.859
P4: I'm used to the VA's orange…

124
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:16.090
P4: box of notification. It is a little… the orange is, I guess it's like…

125
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:26.190
P4: a color's version of yelling at you, but yelling politely. It's not red, so it's not shouting at me, but it does seem like, hey.

126
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:32.309
P4: You know, maybe change it from orange to,

127
00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.270
P4: Or yellow, whatever this is.

128
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:45.500
P4: maybe, I don't know, definitely not green, because green would indicate go. I don't know, it just seems a little loud, but I mean, it's fine. Doesn't bother me anymore.

129
00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:51.089
Moderator: I gotcha. You're, like, politely yelling at you, but you want it to tone down a little bit.

130
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:54.930
P4: Yeah, I mean… I don't know, maybe it's just me, but…

131
00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:01.430
P4: then orange is, like, it's very bold and stands out, but I think that's probably the purpose.

132
00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:09.970
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, do you trust this information… do you trust that this information is accurate if you were to see this, alert?

133
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.779
P4: Yes, I would definitely trust this.

134
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:20.409
Moderator: Okay, and then after seeing this, information here, what would you do after seeing this message?

135
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:24.050
P4: I would click Continue.

136
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:29.990
Moderator: Is there a why that you want to click continue after seeing this message?

137
00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:49.709
P4: It doesn't give me any other option. Well, I could go back to the previous page, but it says continue this application, or finish this application later. I don't need to finish it later. I would click continue to see what the next page told me. Maybe it would give me more information, or redirect me to…

138
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.280
P4: I don't know. I don't know.

139
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.799
Moderator: Oh, it's not.

140
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.980
P4: page, so out of curiosity, I would just click continue to find out what's next.

141
00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:08.679
Moderator: So, in this, in this case, then, if you're a… if you're seeing this message, you would like it to give you instructions to do something else if… if you want… if the app wants you to do something else.

142
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:23.299
P4: Yeah, if I'm either gonna continue the application, I don't need to finish it later if I'm not eligible, maybe click OK, or close, or something like that, but, like…

143
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:36.880
P4: Would I scroll up and click back to the previous page? But from here, where it tells me you're not eligible because you're in TRICARE, then maybe okay, or something there, because…

144
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.349
P4: I want to click continue to find…

145
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.740
Moderator: Gotcha.

146
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:41.400
P4: What the next step is.

147
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:41.860
Moderator: What do you mean.

148
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.690
P4: next step.

149
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:47.890
Moderator: Would it be helpful if we include, like, a button here that says, exit application?

150
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:52.470
P4: Yeah, because instead of finish this application later.

151
00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.050
P4: What am I finishing if I'm not eligible?

152
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.480
Moderator: Right.

153
00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.820
Moderator: Now, I…

154
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.349
P4: That should be gone, and it should be…

155
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.819
P4: Thank you for your time, go away, or something, I don't know.

156
00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:16.280
Moderator: So, in your case, if you were to see this message, you want, like, an exit application option, and then you would think that you wouldn't see the continue button, is that correct?

157
00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:20.469
P4: Correct. And to finish this application later, that seems weird.

158
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:23.310
Moderator: I gotcha. So that's a little weird for you.

159
00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:32.499
P4: It is. If it's saying I'm not eligible, basically you're… it's telling me you're not eligible, but you can do this later if you'd like to find out that you're not eligible.

160
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.589
Moderator: Right, that makes sense.

161
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:42.580
Moderator: And then, if you believe this check was wrong, and that you're actually not eligible for TRICARE, what would you do?

162
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:57.049
P4: I don't know, because it says… even if you're not enrolled in TRICARE, you're not eligible for CHAMP VA benefits, because if you're eligible for TRICARE,

163
00:16:57.220 --> 00:17:03.240
P4: I don't know, maybe I'd click continue again to find out what the next step is, or I would…

164
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.920
P4: Call my VSO,

165
00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:15.550
P4: I think maybe there should be more information here that would say, if you disagree with this, press continue,

166
00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:22.530
P4: If you disagree with this call, 1-800-827-1000…

167
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.819
P4: Because what if… what if I'm not in TRICARE?

168
00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:26.810
Moderator: I got it.

169
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:31.600
P4: disagree with it. There's really nothing I can do. This is kind of like the end-all

170
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.100
P4: saying, you're in TRICARE, Or, even if I'm not.

171
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.889
P4: I'm not eligible for CHAMP VA because I'm eligible for truck. It doesn't explain why.

172
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:43.779
Moderator: I got.

173
00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.679
P4: It doesn't give me the option.

174
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.740
P4: To disagree with it, or to contact somebody to…

175
00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.420
P4: Find out what my next step would be.

176
00:17:53.420 --> 00:18:01.730
Moderator: Right. So you wanted more information, and then, essentially, more information on what you can do next if

177
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:10.119
Moderator: If you think it's wrong, and then potentially calling someone if you're either stuck or even continuing to find out.

178
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:14.230
Moderator: If you can… Kind of basically move forward with this.

179
00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:15.340
P4: Correct.

180
00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:24.109
Moderator: Alright, that makes sense. So does this feel like the system is helping you understand your option, or is the system blocking you from applying?

181
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:27.759
P4: It's… right now, it's blocking me from applying.

182
00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:34.380
P4: and I understand… What it's saying about my eligibility.

183
00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:41.880
P4: But if I disagreed with it, I don't see where… I don't see what,

184
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:45.549
P4: My options would be.

185
00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:46.370
Moderator: I gotcha.

186
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.119
P4: What if this information's wrong?

187
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:48.920
Moderator: Right.

188
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.260
P4: Now I'm… I'm stuck.

189
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.819
P4: and it's saying I'm not eligible, but I feel like it's wrong, there's nothing I can do.

190
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:03.319
Moderator: I gotcha. Alright, thank you for that, and then we can proceed to the next portion.

191
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.419
Moderator: Go ahead and click continue here.

192
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.790
Moderator: And same as before, as you're going through this, please think out loud.

193
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:16.590
P4: Okay, permanent and total disabled, so based on my disability rating, BS.

194
00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:21.400
P4: Are any of your applicants eligible?

195
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:26.379
P4: Okay, so it looks like they're eligible for TRICARE.

196
00:19:27.020 --> 00:19:44.810
P4: And… yes, no, I don't know. And I can check to see if they're eligible. Check my eligibility on the trickier website. Interesting, so that works. So, I guess clicking continue puts me into the next step and kind of explains why.

197
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.450
P4: They weren't eligible, and provides me an option to get more information.

198
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.440
Moderator: Okay.

199
00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.340
Moderator: We can go ahead and continue.

200
00:19:54.270 --> 00:20:03.800
P4: I am permanent. So, the veteran or applicant is not… Eligible for TRICARE.

201
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.580
P4: Let's see…

202
00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.460
P4: May not be eligible.

203
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:26.180
P4: So, they're eligible for TRICARE, so they don't qualify. So I guess at this point, if I knew…

204
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:34.899
P4: that to be true, that my dependents were eligible for TRICARE, I would exit the application. If I disagreed with it.

205
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.689
P4: I will click continue, because…

206
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:39.050
Moderator: Okay.

207
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:50.459
P4: does tell me that if I did meet the requirements, or think that they may still be eligible, maybe I disagree with their eligibility for TRICARE, I'd click continue.

208
00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.750
Moderator: I gotcha. And then in your own words, can you tell me what this page means?

209
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.189
P4: It basically…

210
00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:12.700
P4: breaks it down and says, hey, you've met this connection for eligibility for CHAMP VA, but there's this other connection, that you did not meet, because you're not eligible for TRICARE.

211
00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:21.999
P4: Gives me the option to leave the application and say, okay, well, I agree, or it does give me the option to continue with the application because I disagree.

212
00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:23.320
Moderator: I gotcha.

213
00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:30.300
Moderator: And then, what do you think the icon or checkmark means to you, that icon in the gray box up there?

214
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:50.649
P4: This right here tells me that out of these three requirements, I meet this one in the checkmark. The veteran does. The veteran is permanently and totally disabled from service-connected disability. I don't think the veteran died, because earlier the veteran was the self.

215
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:55.309
P4: doing the application, so the veteran's not dead.

216
00:21:55.470 --> 00:22:03.870
P4: So, basically, it's letting the veteran know that they've met this requirement, however, They don't meet this requirement.

217
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:08.400
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, based on the screen you're seeing now,

218
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:11.890
Moderator: What would you do if you were applying today?

219
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:15.139
P4: Well, if I was Riley Smith, I would…

220
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:24.700
P4: either exit the application, or if I disagreed and my dependents were not in TRICARE, I would click Continue.

221
00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:37.140
Moderator: I gotcha. So you'd think that, if it makes sense to you, you would exit the application, because the logic makes sense, but if you disagree with that system's logic, then you would continue on.

222
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:38.390
P4: Correct.

223
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.180
Moderator: Alright.

224
00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.040
Moderator: And then,

225
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:54.010
Moderator: how confident, if you're like Riley Smith, and you're trying to apply, and let's say you're seeing this, how confident are you in… in your understanding of how this whole system is set up?

226
00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.930
P4: I'm pretty confident it's pretty straightforward. You know, the previous page left some questions to be answered.

227
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:13.890
P4: The previous couple of pages, but this one answers those questions, and, you know, perfectly, and allows

228
00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:31.570
P4: me as the veteran to either agree with the fact that, like, yeah, my dependents are eligible for TRICARE, I can go ahead and exit, or if I know this to be untrue, I can still pursue the claim and still continue the application.

229
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:42.029
Moderator: Okay, that makes sense. And then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this screen?

230
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.119
P4: Oh, 5, it's super easy.

231
00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:50.039
Moderator: Okay, thank you for that. And then you can click continue, which sets us back to the

232
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:59.999
Moderator: beginning of this prototype here. And then for the third task, we'll go through, the prototype blue bean, blue bean, blueberry here. On this

233
00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:16.839
Moderator: where it's gonna be a very similar, look and feel, and then for this first page, it's, basically very similar, so you can go ahead and click continue all the way down there. Not continue, it's the… this… this box, that blue box there.

234
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:18.670
Moderator: Go ahead and click on that.

235
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:21.990
P4: Start your form without… or sign integrated count?

236
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:24.140
Moderator: Yeah. Alright, just click on that, yes.

237
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:24.780
P4: Okay.

238
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.970
Moderator: And then for this, prototype, go ahead and proceed the same as you did before by,

239
00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:38.969
Moderator: going through these questions, and then thinking out loud as much as possible. Again, we just want to hear your thoughts on the content and the information here.

240
00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:47.979
P4: Okay, I got you. It's all pretty much the same as it was before. This person is the veteran applying for the benefits for the spouse, the pendant, or both.

241
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:55.539
P4: And it's got all the same demographics, same birthdates, all imported from their VA portal.

242
00:24:56.770 --> 00:25:02.229
P4: And then… permanent total disabled connection from service, yes.

243
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:16.320
P4: Alright, are any applicants eligible or enrolled in TRICARE? So, no, they're not enrolled in TRICARE. I can check eligibility.

244
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.559
P4: finish it later, but I can click continue, so we'll continue.

245
00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:27.889
P4: And… So Riley is permanent and total disabled, and…

246
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:44.049
P4: him and his dependents are not eligible for TRICARE. So it says, hey, if you didn't meet these, if there's any red boxes or red X's up there, you can exit. But if you've got green checks all the way across, you can go ahead and click continue.

247
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.300
Moderator: So, you would proceed with this application, then?

248
00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.510
P4: Correct.

249
00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:58.319
Moderator: Alright, and then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand the second prototype here?

250
00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.239
P4: 5, very easily.

251
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.670
Moderator: Okay.

252
00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.769
P4: I feel like it had less continues.

253
00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.240
Moderator: That's something you noticed?

254
00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:09.400
P4: Yeah.

255
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.660
Moderator: Alright, noted.

256
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:22.519
Moderator: And then, comparing… I know it's very similar, or very similar on both for you here. Comparing the two prototypes, which one would you prefer to use?

257
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.250
P4: The blueberry.

258
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.389
Moderator: The blueberry, and why is that?

259
00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:36.930
P4: It just… it was… Well, faster, I guess. There were less… once it imported the veteran's information.

260
00:26:37.150 --> 00:26:44.289
P4: and then you answer the eligibility questions, it goes right into the application. I feel like, and I could be wrong.

261
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:52.920
P4: But it does feel like there was an additional 2 pages of continues, one or two pages of continues.

262
00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:59.490
P4: to answer, and I might be wrong, but this one just feels… sharper.

263
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:07.289
Moderator: That is a sharp eye right there, because the other one has the,

264
00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:16.389
Moderator: the check where you have at the bottom of the page, it checks to see if you're eligible or not. That alert message, if you recall.

265
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:18.440
P4: the orange message.

266
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.870
Moderator: Yeah, that is correct.

267
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:24.779
P4: I like this better. If there was a red X that says, hey, you don't meet all the requirements.

268
00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:31.290
P4: I would move on, but… I like this version better.

269
00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:36.650
Moderator: I gotcha. Just because it's, kind of shorter and goes… you go through it quicker.

270
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.809
P4: Yeah, I think it's more direct.

271
00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.750
Moderator: Gotcha. It's not giving me excess information.

272
00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:51.399
Moderator: And then, so thinking about everything that you saw from both prototype, was it too much, too little, or about the right amount of information?

273
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:56.289
P4: Well, knowing what I know now about the two, I'd say the first one…

274
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.230
P4: What was the first one?

275
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:05.119
Moderator: The first one was the pineapple, the pineapple one? Yeah, with the alert message.

276
00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:10.340
P4: Pineapple, given the extra alert message sometimes with veterans.

277
00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:10.660
Moderator: Yeah.

278
00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.350
P4: We obsess about details.

279
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.589
P4: And obsess over information.

280
00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:21.260
P4: So… Having an additional screen with…

281
00:28:21.370 --> 00:28:26.600
P4: Additional information that's also found on this page can be confusing.

282
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:36.330
P4: So I think this one is much better, because it has… The right information without

283
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.490
P4: doubling down on the information, I guess, without…

284
00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:40.480
Moderator: I gotcha.

285
00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.780
P4: repeating itself.

286
00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:42.500
Moderator: Right.

287
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:47.989
Moderator: And then, if you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident in doing so?

288
00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:53.899
P4: Yeah, yeah, most definitely. The first one, blueberry, or second one, blueberry, I'd tell him, yeah.

289
00:28:54.520 --> 00:29:00.599
Moderator: I gotcha. Alright, thank you for that. And then we can go ahead and scroll down to the bottom of the page here to continue.

290
00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:13.730
Moderator: And then you've just finished the two prototypes, and then at the bottom, we do have a couple of additional messages for you to look at. The first one is going to be the warning alerts. Go ahead and click into that.

291
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.229
Moderator: I will read a few scenarios for you to,

292
00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:26.270
Moderator: and then you'll review the message. We have about 5 messages here, and each one of them has different alerts, and then each one I'll just ask you,

293
00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:44.070
Moderator: one or two questions on each one. So the first one, you enter the veteran's name, which is, I guess, you or Riley in this case, and then you see the following message. So it's the… it's the orange alert that we mentioned before. Please think out loud on… about your thoughts around this alert.

294
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:54.149
P4: So if I put my information in, and I got this message, I would assume that the VA8 didn't have my DD214,

295
00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.510
P4: Or…

296
00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:09.400
P4: I wasn't registered for an account, but I'm signed in, so maybe I didn't verify my identity or something. I would assume that the VA's missing some service information.

297
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:11.699
P4: from my service.

298
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:19.830
Moderator: I gotcha. And then in this scenario, would you want to apply for the CHAMP VA benefit despite this warning?

299
00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:26.930
P4: I would want to… fix the warning. So, if they couldn't find my information.

300
00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:32.539
P4: I mean, I'd probably call the 1-800 number and be like, why don't you have my information?

301
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:38.819
Moderator: I gotcha. So you want more information, or specific why is missing, or what is.

302
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:45.669
P4: Tell me what's missing. Like, we could find your information in the system, We're missing your DD214.

303
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:46.420
Moderator: Gotcha.

304
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.710
P4: loaded here. Okay, let's do that.

305
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:52.040
Moderator: Gotcha. You want to resolve this message, essentially.

306
00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:57.639
P4: I do. That's what I came to the website for, was to do something. If I'm getting an error message, I'd like to resolve it.

307
00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:01.970
Moderator: Gotcha. And then go ahead, we'll go to, alert B here.

308
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:07.329
Moderator: And then, same thing, you enter your information, and now you're seeing this message.

309
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.390
P4: I would…

310
00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:20.529
P4: I would probably click continue, to…

311
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:29.840
P4: And then I would give it a couple of days, and then maybe call. This tells me that there might be something wrong with the VA portal.

312
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:31.210
Moderator: I gotcha.

313
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:43.180
Moderator: So in your mind, there might be something wrong with the portal, so you'll maybe continue the application, and then if it's still happening, if this alert still continues, you'll make a call to the VA.

314
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:44.530
P4: Correct.

315
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:49.240
Moderator: I gotcha. Thank you for that. And then, let's move on to the next one.

316
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:53.850
Moderator: A SAM scenario, you enter your information, and you see this message.

317
00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:06.989
P4: I would check my information. This message is a little different than the first one, because this one says.

318
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:17.940
P4: check the information you entered. Maybe I put somebody's… some information in wrong. Maybe I mixed up numbers on the social. I would double-check my information.

319
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:29.119
Moderator: Okay, so based on this one, you want to double check. And then, after filling it out, after double checking and everything's okay, or alright by what you think is correct.

320
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:32.249
Moderator: And you're still seeing this message, what would you do?

321
00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.710
P4: All the VA.

322
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.959
Moderator: Okay, so would you recall a VA?

323
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:37.579
P4: I'd want it resolved.

324
00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:42.039
Moderator: Yeah, that makes sense to me. And then, go ahead and go to Alert D.

325
00:32:45.610 --> 00:32:52.759
P4: This one, if I was enrolled in TRICARE, then I would be like, okay, well, that's…

326
00:32:53.060 --> 00:33:00.810
P4: That's that. I know whether or not I'm getting TRICARE as my primary medical provider. Nobody…

327
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:07.430
P4: Does the TRICARE recipient, unless they're a child, doesn't know that's their insurance.

328
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.730
Moderator: Gotcha.

329
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.750
P4: So… I would…

330
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:17.909
P4: I would only want more information if I believed… if I knew for a fact this to be not true.

331
00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:32.669
Moderator: Gotcha. So, if you think the system, or it's an error on the VA or the system side, then you want more information… more information on how to correct it, but if you think this is correct, then you're okay with this message.

332
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.810
P4: Yes.

333
00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.920
Moderator: Alright, that makes sense. And then finally, Alert E.

334
00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.099
P4: It's green. Green means go.

335
00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.180
Moderator: Alright.

336
00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:43.979
P4: click and continue, it means I've…

337
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.419
P4: Everything is correct, and there are no errors.

338
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:53.360
Moderator: And then, across all the alerts that you saw, how confident do you feel you know what to do?

339
00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.740
P4: I feel very confident.

340
00:33:55.740 --> 00:34:00.769
Moderator: And then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very confident, and 5 being very…

341
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:06.769
Moderator: Or, I'm sorry, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being not very confident, and 5 being very confident.

342
00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:08.330
P4: 5.

343
00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:17.460
Moderator: 5, alright. And then, were there any alerts that was confusing and unclear to you? No. I believe you mentioned A earlier, but has that changed?

344
00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:27.829
P4: I mean… I think… If they can't find the information in its system.

345
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:31.689
P4: And I knew the information was correct.

346
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.060
P4: I'd want to know what the next step is.

347
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:37.199
Moderator: Gotcha. You want that instruction.

348
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.190
P4: Correct.

349
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:46.390
Moderator: Alright, and go ahead and click back to the prototype menu. And then finally, for the last one, we'll go to the summary card.

350
00:34:46.980 --> 00:35:03.620
Moderator: So, on this screen, you have four summary cards. The first two, card style A, are from the prototype we just went through, and then the third and fourth card are cardstyle B, are alternative designs, so please take a few moments to kind of review all this, all four of this.

351
00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:07.399
Moderator: I know it's a little bit tricky on the… on the phone, but.

352
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.669
P4: Go ahead, think out loud as you're doing this.

353
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:21.769
P4: They look very similar to me. Based on the information, applicants may be eligible based on your responses.

354
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:25.650
Moderator: Alright.

355
00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:29.709
Moderator: And then, what do you think each car is telling you?

356
00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:36.839
P4: So, this one's… I got double green checks. This one's telling me that the veteran is

357
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:45.169
P4: meets the requirement for permanent and total, and then, also meets the requirement for not being eligible to TRICARE.

358
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:52.789
P4: So this one, first one tells me that the application can continue, everything is going As it should.

359
00:35:53.940 --> 00:36:00.440
P4: The next one says that the veteran is permanent and total, but his…

360
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:09.090
P4: his or her dependents are eligible for TRICARE, so… There'll be no preceding On that one.

361
00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:28.339
P4: I see… So, the second one, has your responses meet all the eligibility requirements for CHAMP VA?

362
00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:35.909
P4: And that's kind of like the headline before it gets into the check marks, and that's missing from the first one.

363
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:37.799
P4: I like that.

364
00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:41.470
Moderator: Okay, so you like the style… card style B more.

365
00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:42.270
P4: Correct.

366
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.100
Moderator: Gotcha.

367
00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.960
P4: It basically says the same thing, but it's telling

368
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.610
P4: Based on the veteran's information, the applicants may be eligible.

369
00:36:51.250 --> 00:37:00.830
P4: Okay, maybe, but now it's saying, your responses meet all the eligibility requirements. That's, to me, is saying, concrete.

370
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.030
P4: Proceed, like… You did it.

371
00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:05.610
Moderator: Gotcha.

372
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.110
Moderator: And you liked that.

373
00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.290
P4: Sorry, excuse me.

374
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:11.770
Moderator: And then you like that extra detail there.

375
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.800
P4: I do, I think it's important.

376
00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:20.440
Moderator: I gotcha. Thank you for that. And then, was there any part of the card that felt unclear or confusing?

377
00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:21.290
P4: Nope.

378
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:27.040
Moderator: Alright, and I think that was it. You can end the screen share here.

379
00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:32.690
Moderator: I do have a couple of, last post-task questions.

380
00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:43.230
Moderator: So, is there any, other feedback you'd like to add about the two prototypes and messages that we… you saw today?

381
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.610
P4: No, I… I like both of them. I think,

382
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:54.970
P4: I think the blueberry one was… I just liked it better, I guess, because…

383
00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.390
P4: It didn't have double information? I don't know.

384
00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:11.790
P4: It just seems smoother, cleaner, in terms of, like, what's next, and clicking and going through the process. And then, I think, adding that little blurb on card B,

385
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:28.289
P4: letting the veteran know, like, hey, you meet all the eligibility requirements for Champ B. I think that's an important little piece, especially if you have an older veteran who doesn't understand the process very well, and, you know, they read every line.

386
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:32.610
P4: So to be clear and concise with someone who

387
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:37.159
P4: can already confuse themselves, I think, is important.

388
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:49.540
Moderator: I gotcha. Thank you for that. And then, this is just, like, an overall broad question here. Do you have a preference on… for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

389
00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:55.749
P4: No, I think, you know, as long as it's…

390
00:38:56.100 --> 00:39:10.450
P4: I like the green checks as you're going through, and the red X, you know, whether you're eligible for it. If you're not eligible, there's a red X, and it says you're not eligible for this reason. I think… I think that's good. I think it breaks it down pretty good.

391
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:16.110
Moderator: Alright, thank you, and then I'll double-check to see if the observer has any questions.

392
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.049
Moderator: If not, do you have any questions for me?

393
00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.590
P4: No, I don't have any questions.

394
00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:31.689
Moderator: All right, so I'd like to circle back to reconfirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.

395
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.140
P4: Yeah.

396
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.759
Moderator: Alright, and then just to remind you, we will,

397
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:55.479
Moderator: We will remove any and all information that could be used to identify you before sharing that, before sharing clips, and, we only share the video within our, the VA part… within, sorry, within the VA and its partner for the purpose of improving the, VA.gov and the digital experience.

398
00:39:56.260 --> 00:40:17.399
Moderator: And then finally, we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is super helpful for us to continue to work on the site and make sure everything works for the veterans and their family. And then lastly, preaching, we'll send you, like, a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans and their family that you may know.

399
00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:24.470
Moderator: To provide them with a chance to participate in, like, future studies like this. Okay. And, thank you again, enjoy the rest of your day.

400
00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:35.940
P4: You too, thank you so much. I appreciate being able to be a part of it, and, you know, give you some feedback, and just kind of see, you know, what you guys are doing with the VA and with the portal.

401
00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:44.909
P4: I think it's important to get feedback from the veterans. There's so many veterans that are frustrated, and they don't understand things, and they get angry when they're confused, and they give up.

402
00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.040
Moderator: Absolutely.

403
00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:46.370
P4: any.

404
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.710
Moderator: Yeah.

405
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:51.869
P4: So I think it's important to include veterans in the process, like you're doing, so thank you for that.

406
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:59.499
Moderator: Yeah, thank you for that. Thank you for today. You've been extremely helpful for us. Alright, enjoy the rest of your day!

407
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.880
Moderator: You too, thank you. Bye.

408
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.670
P4: Bye.
