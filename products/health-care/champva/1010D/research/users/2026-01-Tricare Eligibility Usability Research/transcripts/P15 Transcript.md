Moderator: I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.530
P15: Yes.

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:21.510
Moderator: Alright, and then, are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip of our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we decide to remove any information that could be used to identify you?

4
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.220
P15: Yes.

5
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:35.189
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then we'll move right into some warm-up questions. Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the CHAMFA program?

6
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.260
P15: No, sir.

7
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.469
Moderator: Okay. And then, have you ever heard of the Champa program before?

8
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.020
P15: I've heard of, CHAMPS, before, yes.

9
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.259
Moderator: Okay, and then in your own word, can you explain what the eligibility of that program is?

10
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.460
P15: I… since I'm not involved with that, I don't know what it is. I know it's some sort of insurance.

11
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.410
P15: I had a friend when,

12
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:10.369
P15: Her dad was, retired military, and she had,

13
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.119
P15: talked about more, I believe it was called TRICARE?

14
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.839
P15: And,

15
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:26.429
P15: You know, we just, you know, in passing, had conversations about, you know, she was already an adult, but her mom

16
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.479
P15: And her dad had it, because her dad was retired.

17
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:39.499
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, do you think you'd be able to tell, tell the difference between, or explain the difference between TRICARE and CHAMFA?

18
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.430
P15: No. No, I couldn't.

19
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:58.750
Moderator: That's not an issue. Alright, so I am going to share a link with you in chat of the prototype, and then I'd like you to kind of open it in your browser to share, your… to do a screen share with your Zoom. And then I'd like to confirm that you are on a desktop or a laptop today.

20
00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.470
P15: Yes.

21
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.460
Moderator: Okay, so I'll get a… I'll get that link going.

22
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.249
Moderator: So I have pasted it in the, Zoom chat.

23
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.019
Moderator: Let me know if you have trouble opening it or navigating to it.

24
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:25.179
P15: Could you bring it up again? It popped up, and it disappeared.

25
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.639
Moderator: Okay, not an issue there.

26
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.650
P15: Okay.

27
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.030
P15: Okay.

28
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.019
Moderator: And then it takes a little bit of time to open in the browser.

29
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.530
Moderator: that's open. Please screen share.

30
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.500
Moderator: And then let me know if you need, some help with the screen sharing portion as well.

31
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.230
P15: Okay, it's still loading.

32
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.970
Moderator: Sure thing.

33
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.080
P15: Okay, it says, photo type blueberry and pineapple.

34
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.810
Moderator: Okay, so that's loaded, and now I need you to screen share. Do you know… are you familiar with that process?

35
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.089
P15: No.

36
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:26.219
Moderator: Okay, on the bottom of your Zoom screen, there's a bunch of buttons. One of them should have a share option. If you click on that, you should be able to… it will ask you which portion of your screen to share. Go ahead and click on the browser.

37
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.130
Moderator: Or something of that.

38
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.860
Moderator: Nature.

39
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.909
P15: Oh, all I have is the virtual agent.

40
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.990
Moderator: There might be a button that says More.

41
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.090
Moderator: Or a share button would be generally something in green, maybe?

42
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:45.570
P15: Hmm.

43
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.889
Moderator: Do you not see anything like that?

44
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.419
P15: No, sir.

45
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.849
Moderator: Okay, let's see, and then you are on a laptop, or a desktop of some sort?

46
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.249
P15: I'm using my iPad.

47
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.140
Moderator: Okay, let me see… iPad… would be…

48
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.630
Moderator: It might have, like, a…

49
00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:15.820
Moderator: broadcast button, so on the bottom of your screen, it should have, like, a shared option. You might have to click on the more

50
00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.430
Moderator: Option.

51
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.229
P15: There you go.

52
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.119
P15: So… oh, alright.

53
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.230
Moderator: And then there might be an option that says broadcast screen instead.

54
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.880
Moderator: Does any of that click?

55
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.610
P15: We can see your messages.

56
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.190
P15: Hmm.

57
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.690
Moderator: You're still not seeing a, a shared option?

58
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.510
P15: Hmm, no.

59
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.029
Moderator: Alright, we'll try one more time, and then I do have a backup.

60
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:18.590
Moderator: So, at the bottom of your Zoom screen, the one that you're in chat with me here.

61
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.039
Moderator: at the bottom there?

62
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.249
P15: What I see is, the two links to the right.

63
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:48.850
P15: And, after the link, it has a plus sign with a circle, then it says, message everyone, it has a happy face, and then an arrow pointing to the right, and underneath, it says, who can see your messages? Recording on, and that's all it says.

64
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.599
Moderator: Okay, that is your chat window.

65
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.190
Moderator: So you might need to navigate to…

66
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.619
Moderator: back to the screen that you see, or if you click on my face, I think you should be able to navigate back to the main screen.

67
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.370
P15: There it is. Yes, yes, I apologize.

68
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:07.730
Moderator: No worries.

69
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.830
Moderator: And then at the bottom of that, that should… there should be a shared option.

70
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:29.550
Moderator: And then on our iPad, I believe the option is to…

71
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.660
Moderator: Broadcast, yep, so I see the broadcasting now.

72
00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:42.160
Moderator: You might have to navigate to the browser that you open up the

73
00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.499
Moderator: That you open up the prototype in.

74
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.900
P15: Got it.

75
00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.710
Moderator: Okay.

76
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.760
Moderator: I'm seeing it load.

77
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.400
Moderator: We'll give it a minute or so.

78
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.650
Moderator: Alright, so we're here.

79
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.510
P15: I apologize.

80
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:03.869
Moderator: No worries. Everything's, you know, every program's a little bit different.

81
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:17.489
Moderator: Alright, so on this page here, there is, you're seeing two buttons, a prototype of blueberry and a prototype pineapple. We'll go ahead and start with the pineapple, so that orange button.

82
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.259
Moderator: Go ahead and click on that.

83
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:28.400
Moderator: And then on this first page here, please take a minute or so to look over the instruction, and then when you're ready, in your own word, tell me what this means to you.

84
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:51.179
P15: It's just info for CHAMP VA. It gives the prerequisites, who's eligible, and it's for, to qualify for health insurance, through the CHAMP VA.

85
00:07:51.410 --> 00:08:01.259
P15: And, then it says, follow those steps, check your eligibility, has different… Links and so forth.

86
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.820
Moderator: Okay, and then who is eligible to apply?

87
00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:15.240
P15: That would be the spouse, dependent, the survivor of a veteran, the service member who meets certain criteria.

88
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.309
P15: That's it.

89
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.320
Moderator: And then, do you see any reason you might not be eligible?

90
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:32.950
P15: Myself, I am, the spouse of a veteran.

91
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:39.880
P15: But I'm, doing this study as the caregiver for my father.

P15: disabled.

95
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.910

P15: To check your eligibility under, number 1, I gotcha. As a tab.

97
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:13.060
Moderator: And then, within that step, there's a line that says, we'll also check… we'll also help you check your eligibility when you complete this form. What is your expectation, if any, when you read this sentence?

98
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.670

P15: My eligibility.

100
00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.979
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, is there anything here that makes you uncertain about applying?

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.090
P15: Nope.

102
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:35.189
Moderator: And then… so, in this case, would you… if you wanted to apply today, would you continue, or would you want more information first? Why?

103
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.209
P15: I would like to know,

104
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:46.990

105
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.960
P15: What it does and does not cover, or…

106
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.269
P15: You know, just how the program works.

107
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:59.399
Moderator: I gotcha. So you want that, like, a benefit package or listing of it.

108
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.600
P15: At least some bullet points.

109
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.510
Moderator: Gotcha.

110
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:14.099
Moderator: And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly, and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

111
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:15.690
P15: Right.

112
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.650
Moderator: Five?

113
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.979
Moderator: So nothing really that needs improvement here, then?

114
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:26.480
P15: Well, besides the bullet points.

115
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.390
Moderator: Okay.

116
00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.000
P15: No.

117
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:40.049

119
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:44.710
P15: Yes.

120
00:10:44.710 --> 00:11:02.710
Moderator: So, in this prototype, we pre-filled all the information that you would normally type in if you're doing this for real. Please go through the next few questions, and then remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here, and then once you're ready, you can click the continue button.

121
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.319
P15: Oh, okay, so you want me to, on number one, check, the eligibility.

122
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:17.939
Moderator: So, like, think out loud, like, how you would normally go through an application, just kind of talk out loud as you're doing this.

123
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:28.750
P15: I would just, read the, short paragraphs, and then, I would…

124
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.750
P15: Click continue. It's very straightforward.

P15: Dependent or survivor of a veteran applying for benefits for myself.

132
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:04.330
P15: Or, in my dad's case, He's, 100% disabled.

133
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:11.050
P15: I may… Complete this on his behalf, and click the middle…

134
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:16.420

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:35.990
P15: It's just asking basic information, the veteran's name, date of birth, They're social.

140
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:39.019
P15: Very straightforward again.

Moderator: Okay.

144
00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:53.770
P15: And I love that it's already… I'm assuming… This prototype is…

145
00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.860
P15: Someone would have to go through,

146
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:06.749
P15: the, VA app, and then everything would be, loaded for them, I'm assuming.

147
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.069
P15: Is, is that… What it should be.

148
00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:14.230
Moderator: It depends on, how you got here, basically. Oh, okay, okay.

149
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:21.840
P15: It would be nice if… If someone were to… Find this,

150
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:30.709
P15: This information, and they're wanting to apply, that everything is already pre-populated.

151
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:31.340
Moderator: Gotcha.

152
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.750

Moderator: Thank you for that feedback, and then apology right there for that, that, yellow warning there?

154
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:44.979
Moderator: Can you take a look at that, and let me know when you're ready to answer a few questions?

155
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.680
P15: Okay.

156
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.519
Moderator: So how do you feel about the way this application checks your eligibility?

157
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:07.849
P15: I think it's great. It saves time, and it's telling the applicant they may not be, eligible for the benefits and the reason why.

158
00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:08.500
Moderator: Okay.

159
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.430
P15: straightforward.

160
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:12.919
Moderator: Did you find it helpful, intrusive, or something else?

161
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:13.670
P15: Helpful.

162
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.370
Moderator: Alright, and then, do you trust that this information is accurate?

163
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:18.990
P15: Yes.

164
00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.460
Moderator: So, what would you do after seeing this message?

165
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:38.420
P15: It says, apparently, this person… Is in, already enrolled in TRICARE.

166
00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:46.390
P15: And then it also says, if you're not enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHAMP.

167
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:52.550
P15: benefits if you're eligible for TRICARE, so you can't be, eligible for both, one or the other.

168
00:14:53.250 --> 00:14:54.020
Moderator: Okay.

169
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:57.720
Moderator: And then, what would you do after seeing this message?

170
00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:03.250
P15: I would, definitely,

171
00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:13.139
P15: research in the VA app, if that's how I got here, and, look for information on TRICARE, since it says…

172
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.249
P15: I'm eligible for TRICARE.

173
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:24.380
Moderator: I gotcha. So, if that's the case, you want additional information on TRICARE, what would you like to see here, then?

174
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.259
P15: a link to TRICARE, so I can go straight into it.

175
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.410
Moderator: I gotcha. And then,

176
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:44.259
Moderator: So, it sounds like if you see this message, then you want a link to go to TRICARE to basically investigate what is the deal with TRICARE, essentially. Does that sound accurate?

177
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.160
P15: Yes.

178
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:52.480
Moderator: And then, if you believe this check was wrong, and that you're not actually eligible for TRICARE, what would you do?

179
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:59.450
P15: It would be helpful, if there was… Perhaps another link?

180
00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.309
P15: That I could click on.

181
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.290
P15: You know, that states…

182
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:14.080
P15: Eligible or ineligible, and, you know, click on that link, and then it would take you to… whichever…

183
00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.589
P15: Choice you… you chose.

184
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:26.719
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, would you continue with this application, or you would stop right there and do more of… getting more information around TRICE?

185
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:27.950
P15: I would stop.

186
00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.220
P15: And I'd get more information on the TRICARE.

187
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:41.309
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then, does this, does this feel like the system is helping you understand your option, or is the system blocking you from applying?

188
00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:46.720
P15: Well, it… it brought up the window that states

189
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:51.630
P15: you know, I may not be eligible for CHAMP,

190
00:16:52.240 --> 00:17:05.629
P15: and then talks about TRICARE. So, I mean, to me, that's a time saver, instead of going through the entire application process and finding out at the end that I'm not eligible.

191
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.239
Moderator: Gotcha. So, I prefer that…

192
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:14.329
P15: It comes up almost immediately after checking your personal information, date of birth, and social.

193
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:17.050
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that feedback.

194
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.710
Moderator: Alright, and then you can continue to, The room?

195
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.900
Moderator: And same as before, please,

196
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.500
Moderator: Think out loud as you're going through this.

197
00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:35.079
P15: Okay, I'm reading about the veteran status. It states that if the veteran died.

198
00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:45.239
P15: They'll ask more questions, and then it says, answer to the best of your ability, and the question is, has a veteran died?

199
00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:47.299
P15: I would say no.

200
00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.590
Moderator: Okay, go ahead and click continue when you're ready.

201
00:17:53.010 --> 00:18:01.330
P15: Veterans Service Connected Disability. Is the veteran permanently and totally disabled?

202
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.969
P15: From the service-connected Disability, yes.

203
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:09.960
P15: And then I would look at the drop-down,

204
00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:16.100
P15: Where it defines, the service, disability.

205
00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:16.970
Moderator: Gotcha.

206
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:29.909
P15: And, the prerequisite is This veteran must be 100% disabled.

207
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.599
P15: Not expected to improve.

208
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:37.519
P15: And is permanently and totally disabled.

209
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:39.500
Moderator: Okay.

210
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.560
P15: I like that drop-down.

211
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:49.450
P15: Work with the definition of a service-connected disability.

212
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:53.700
Moderator: Okay, you find that additional info component to be helpful, then?

213
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:54.940
P15: Very helpful.

214
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.130
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that.

215
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:01.169
Moderator: And then you can continue when you're ready.

216
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.250
P15: Okay.

217
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:10.070
P15: It's just going over the eligibility for the TRICARE.

218
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:22.760
P15: And, it just states it's a health program for service members and their families, and it's stating that

219
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.220
P15: In order to be eligible

220
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:29.720
P15: You must be enrolled in TRICARE.

221
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:41.809
P15: And it's for the, you know, and it's required, so I would click yes. And then it has another drop-down for TRICARE eligibility.

222
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.420
P15: and it just states.

223
00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:50.740
P15: the information, the veterans, Uniform Service,

224
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:56.929
P15: decides who's eligible for TRICARE, and it gets reported in DEERS.

225
00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:04.919
P15: And then it has a link that I can click on to check my eligibility on the TRICARE website.

226
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:07.910
P15: So that's good, yes. I like that.

227
00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.460
Moderator: Okay.

228
00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:11.980
Moderator: Then you can continue when you're ready.

229
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.940
P15: Hmm.

230
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:28.500
P15: Okay, so the CHAMPBA benefits, summary, has the box, it states…

231
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:32.600
P15: Based on the veteran's information,

232
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.919
P15: The veteran may not be eligible.

233
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:45.599
P15: And then, it says my response is, either a check or an X.

234
00:20:45.870 --> 00:21:05.070
P15: Veteran is permanently, totally disabled from service-connected disability, or veteran died from a service-connected disability, or the veteran at the time of their death was rated permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected disability.

235
00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:13.030
P15: And then, the ex is the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

236
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:28.190
P15: So, it's a summary of… Based on my responses, for the CHAMP VA.

237
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.900
P15: eligibility.

238
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:38.390
Moderator: Okay, and then I want to make sure I understood you correctly. If you're eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMPA?

239
00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.190
P15: No.

240
00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:44.190
Moderator: Alright, and then, what does the icon and checkmark means to you?

241
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:51.529
P15: The checkmark is, based on my response… my previous responses.

242
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:59.919
P15: It's giving me, I must fall into one of these categories.

243
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:11.020
P15: the, you know, veteran is permanently, totally disabled from service-connected disability. The veteran died from his service-connected disability.

244
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:20.029
P15: Or, at the time of the veteran's death, was rated permanently and totally disabled from their service-connected disability.

245
00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:26.020
Moderator: Okay, and then based on this information, do you think you're eligible for CHAMFO?

246
00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:37.930
P15: Champ, yes, but I would not be eligible for the TRICARE.

247
00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:40.750
Moderator: Okay, and then what makes you say that?

248
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.140
P15: Because there is, an X…

249
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:51.290
P15: in that same box, it says the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TICARE.

250
00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.830
Moderator: Gotcha. And then how confident are you in that understanding?

251
00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:56.560
P15: Confident.

252
00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:02.889
Moderator: And then, what would you do next if you were… if you were really applying today?

253
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:12.219
P15: Let's see. Well, the next thing I would read would be if I didn't, meet all the criteria.

254
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.040
P15: for CHAMP,

255
00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:21.570
P15: benefits, then I can, the next thing I would do would be to exit the application.

256
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:27.200
P15: Then it says, but if you did meet the eligibility requirements.

257
00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:36.249
P15: or still believe you are eligible, select the continue button to complete your application. And I also like

258
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:45.169
P15: Perhaps you're under a time constraint, and you need to complete or go back to this application.

259
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.939
P15: That you don't have to start over from the beginning, and it just picks up right where you left off.

260
00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.159
P15: So that's great. I like that.

261
00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:02.530
Moderator: And then in this scenario, if you were really applying today, would you exit the application, or would you continue on?

262
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:10.900
P15: Well, this is for the CHAP VA, so… I would continue.

263
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.930
Moderator: And then, why is that?

264
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.560
P15: because I met the criteria.

265
00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:16.990
Moderator: I gotcha.

266
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:25.949
Moderator: And then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand the screen?

267
00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:29.990
P15: It… it was, plain and simple, a 5.

268
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:31.120
Moderator: A 5, alright.

269
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:36.659
Moderator: Thank you for that. You can go ahead and click on the continue button.

270
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:37.690
P15: Okay.

271
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:50.100
Moderator: Alright, we're back to the main menu here, and then for the next portion, you just went through the… the orange prototype, now we're gonna go to the pineapple… I mean, sorry, we're gonna go to the blueberry, yeah.

272
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:50.970
P15: Okay.

273
00:24:51.260 --> 00:25:03.350
Moderator: So, for this prototype, you're gonna proceed as you did before. This page here is the same exact page, so you can go ahead and scroll to the bottom of that… towards that blue box.

274
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.640
Moderator: Where you…

275
00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:05.390
P15: Yes.

276
00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:09.519
Moderator: Click, start your form without, signing in.

277
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.399
P15: Okay, that's true.

278
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:22.319
Moderator: And then, just like before, please go through the next few questions, and remember to think out loud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here.

279
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:30.359
P15: Okay, and, this is just stating, the eligibility requirements for CHAMP VA.

280
00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:37.750
P15: It states it's going to ask a few questions to ensure that I'm eligible for CHAMP VA.

281
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:44.570
P15: It states it's going to use the veteran's information.

282
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:52.509
P15: To confirm eligibility for the veteran and the applicants who need the CHAMP VA benefit.

283
00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:58.060
P15: You won't need to load the D… the DD214.

284
00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:04.480
P15: And you must… meet all the eligibility requirements for CHAMP VA.

285
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:11.649
P15: And if not eligible, I could submit an application.

286
00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:19.070
P15: And this would also, delay any benefits for other applicants.

287
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.660
P15: Very straightforward.

288
00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.710
Moderator: Okay, you can click continue when you're ready.

289
00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.380
P15: It's asking for my personal information.

290
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:35.360
P15: Which of the three, describes me best?

291
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:43.149
P15: I'm either the spouse-dependent survivor of a veteran applying for benefits for myself.

292
00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:53.939
P15: I may be the veteran applying for benefits for my spouse, dependents, or both, or I'm applying for benefits on behalf of someone else.

293
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.430
P15: Very, very straightforward again.

294
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.759
Moderator: Alright, click continue when you're ready.

295
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:21.670
P15: Okay, and here it talks about the veteran's personal information, their name, date of birth, and identification information. In this case, it's already pre-populated, for the most part.

296
00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:33.659
P15: even has the date of birth and the social. It also, I do like the fact that it has the asterisk.

297
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:40.850
P15: And in red, it says that this information must be completed and is required.

298
00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:41.630
Moderator: Okay.

299
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.200
P15: That's good.

300
00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.319
Moderator: You can click continue when you're ready.

301
00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:47.010
P15: Okay.

302
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:59.670
P15: Okay, and this talks again about, more eligibility info, the veteran status,

303
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:04.740
P15: Has he died? It's required a yes or no answer.

304
00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:06.950
P15: She was born.

305
00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.429
Moderator: And then click continue when you're ready.

306
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.400
P15: Okay, and this states…

307
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:26.819
P15: the, eligibility of the Veteran Service Connected Disability. It asks if the veteran is permanently and totally disabled.

308
00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:40.759
P15: from a service-connected disability. Again, it's a required response, yes or no. And then it has the drop-down, what the definition of a service-connected disability is.

309
00:28:43.100 --> 00:29:00.140
P15: Then it states that the veteran has a service-connected disability that they've concluded, or the app has concluded they're disabled because of an illness or injury caused or made worse by their active duty service.

310
00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:15.229
P15: and the veteran is permanently or totally disabled, or, I'm sorry, or, the veteran is permanently and totally disabled if they have a disability that they have… the veteran has been rated at 100%,

311
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:17.739
P15: And it's not expected to improve.

312
00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:18.970
Moderator: Okay.

313
00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.290
P15: So that, that second sentence tells me and…

314
00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:30.500
P15: I may be, grasping at straws, but,

315
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:37.940
P15: Perhaps the veteran is, deemed 100% disabled.

316
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:49.430
P15: And they're not expected to improve. There may be some veterans, I'm assuming, that may have 100% disability,

317
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:57.110
P15: And may improve. So then, this… if that was the case, this person wouldn't be eligible.

318
00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.259
Moderator: Okay. If they were to improve.

319
00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:03.640
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that. And then you can click continue when you're ready.

320
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:11.879
P15: I apologize, can I go get, some water? My mouth is getting real dry, all the talking. Excuse me, just a second.

321
00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:12.470
Moderator: No worries.

322
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:33.049
P15: I apologize. I'm back.

323
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:34.000
Moderator: No worries.

324
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:38.440
Moderator: Alright, and then… For this page?

325
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:42.019
P15: Okay, eligibility for TRICARE.

326
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:50.539
P15: It states the veteran, or any of the applicants eligible or enrolled in TRICARE.

327
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.430
P15: Which is the DEERS Health Program.

328
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:58.820
P15: For service members and their…

329
00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:06.710
P15: And their families, excuse me. Again, it has a drop-down, how to check for TRICARE eligibility.

330
00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:13.100
P15: There's 3, there's 3.

331
00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:14.790
Moderator: option.

332
00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.520
P15: Choices, options.

333
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:25.920
P15: Yes, no, or… Perhaps this person doesn't know, if…

334
00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.659
P15: they're already enrolled in the DEERS program.

335
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:29.890
Moderator: Okay.

336
00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:36.230
P15: So, the, the drop-down for the TRICARE eligibility.

337
00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:43.380
P15: It says the uniform service decides who is eligible for TRICARE.

338
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.600
P15: And it gets reported in the deers.

339
00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:48.570
P15: system.

340
00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.850
P15: And then it has a,

341
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:55.519
P15: Link that you can click on for your eligibility.

342
00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.120
P15: Through the TRICARE website.

343
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:03.669
P15: And it's also telling me that this link will take me to a new tab.

344
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.540
Moderator: Gotcha.

345
00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.409
P15: choose it.

346
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.890
Moderator: And then you can click continue when you're ready.

347
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:10.160
P15: Okay.

348
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:17.270
P15: All right, this says the CHAMPS, Benefit Eligibility Summary.

349
00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:25.720
P15: Based on the veteran's information, the applicants may be eligible. Due to my responses of

350
00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:38.819
P15: The veteran is permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected disability, or the veteran's died from his service-connected disability, or the veteran at the time of their death.

351
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:46.260
P15: was rated permanently and totally disabled from their service-connected disability. And…

352
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.110
P15: the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

353
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.829
P15: So this is for the CHAMP VA eligibility.

354
00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:55.950
Moderator: Okay.

355
00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:03.550
Moderator: And then, in this scenario, would you take the same or different action as compared to the other prototype?

356
00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:11.539
P15: This one, everything is, marked with a green check.

357
00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:14.369
P15: So, to me, I would continue.

358
00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.810
Moderator: Gotcha. And it's because of the green check that you're gonna continue then?

359
00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:26.340
P15: Yes, both of the… of the, prerequisites… Gotcha. …are marked.

360
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:35.690
Moderator: And then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, and then 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this second prototype?

361
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:36.590
P15: Bye.

362
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:37.800
Moderator: 5? Alright.

363
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.380
Moderator: N.A.

364
00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.870
Moderator: Why did you give it that rating?

365
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:52.500
P15: This one, compared to the other, the pineapple prototype,

366
00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:57.420
P15: this one didn't have any red X's,

367
00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:06.620
P15: this one, it, it looks like it's clear-cut. I'm, I'm, eligible to proceed for,

368
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:10.389
P15: Applying for the CHAMP benefits.

369
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:17.560
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, comparing the two prototypes, which one would you… would you prefer to use?

370
00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.550
P15: The blueberry.

371
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.550
Moderator: The blueberry, so this one.

372
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:21.599
P15: Yes. Gotcha.

373
00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:25.049
Moderator: And then, is there a reason for that?

374
00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:32.439
P15: This one… This one seemed,

375
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:38.139
P15: This one seemed to,

376
00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:51.959
P15: be a little bit, it's not confusing, whereas the pineapple, it had, one section where the veteran or family members

377
00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:56.649
P15: was eligible, but then it also had that red X.

378
00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:04.170
P15: and stated, the reason why they may not be eligible. This one,

379
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:13.280
P15: it's very obvious, it's clear-cut that, based on the information that I provided,

380
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:19.280
P15: it looks like a, you know, 100% go. They're totally,

381
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:25.150
P15: eligible, you know, to, continue, applying for the CHAMP.

382
00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:26.920
P15: VA benefits.

383
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:28.130
Moderator: Okay.

384
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:29.510
P15: And then, thinking.

385
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:39.749
Moderator: about everything that you just saw, was it, from both prototypes? Was there too much, too little, or about the right amount of information?

386
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:42.160
P15: the right information.

387
00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:49.520
Moderator: Okay, and then if you had to explain this to a friend, how, would you feel confident in doing so?

388
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:50.490
P15: Yes.

389
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:51.900
Moderator: Alrighty.

390
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.559
P15: Using the blueberry.

391
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:54.280
Moderator: Using the blip.

392
00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.330
P15: Cotted pipe, yes.

393
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:57.870
Moderator: Gotcha. If that's more straightforward to you.

394
00:35:57.870 --> 00:35:58.550
P15: Yes.

395
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:02.340
Moderator: Alright, and then you can go ahead and click the continue button there.

396
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:18.460
Moderator: So we have finished both prototypes, and then at the bottom of the screen here, there's two additional, scenarios that I want to go through with you. For the first one, we'll go through the warning alerts, so go ahead and click into there.

397
00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:22.170
Moderator: Alright, so…

398
00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:39.320
Moderator: For here, I'll read a scenario, and then you'll review the message, and then please state any question that you may have, or any feedback that you could provide. So, for Alert A, in this scenario, you enter the veteran's information, and then you see the following warning alert.

399
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:47.410
Moderator: Please think out loud on what your thought around what this alert means, and then explain the action you would take in this scenario.

400
00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.590
P15: Okay, so it states that…

401
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:57.160
P15: The app cannot, confirm the eligibility of the applicants.

402
00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:03.940
P15: And, it also states they could not find the veteran's information in their system.

403
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:06.740
P15: If you think this is an error.

404
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:25.009
P15: check the… the information you entered, so I would then, look for a button that has… or if there was maybe a drop-down or a link where I could go backwards and re-review all of the

405
00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:33.889
P15: Information, of the veteran, or perhaps a spouse or dependent, to… to ensure that

406
00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:36.769
P15: I completed the information properly.

407
00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:43.970
Moderator: Gotcha. And then, in this scenario, would you want to apply for CHAMPA benefit despite seeing this warning?

408
00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:45.390
P15: Sure.

409
00:37:45.790 --> 00:37:49.030
Moderator: And then, is there a reason for that?

410
00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.240
P15: Well, I mean, it's just telling you that,

411
00:37:53.730 --> 00:38:02.149
P15: They couldn't, find the information on the veteran, and to go back in,

412
00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:07.549
P15: You know, review the info that, you completed, so…

413
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:13.680
P15: I would just, as I mentioned, go back, review the information, and

414
00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:19.720
P15: perhaps there was an error or errors, I would correct those, and then,

415
00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:27.840
P15: look for any… once I did that, I would, look for any alerts, such as the warning alert.

416
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:38.089
Moderator: Gotcha. Thank you for that. And then for Alert B, in this scenario, you enter the veteran's information, like before, and then you see, that message.

417
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:52.599
P15: Okay, so this says that, again, they can't confirm the eligibility of the applicants. You can either try again later, or select continue to complete your application. Hmm.

418
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.720
P15: So…

419
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:02.049
P15: Perhaps that they had a link,

420
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:09.209
P15: That you could click on, again, to go, that would take you to the beginning of the

421
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:16.210
P15: information, perhaps… Again, there was error or errors made.

422
00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:22.930
P15: And, once those were corrected, if that was the case,

423
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:30.409
P15: Then it's… the program should allow me to go forth with the application.

424
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:35.039
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, if you still see this message after,

425
00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:40.829
Moderator: fixing your air, what would you do? Would you still go ahead and continue?

426
00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:56.330
P15: Perhaps, hmm. It's kind of confusing, you know, either to try again later or continue.

427
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:58.770
P15: To complete your application.

428
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:06.240
P15: I really… I really don't,

429
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.779
P15: I really don't like the Alert B.

430
00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:18.209
P15: because it's either try again later.

431
00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:21.700
P15: Who wants to go back into a nap and…

432
00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.789
P15: You know, that's telling me,

433
00:40:24.940 --> 00:40:32.260
P15: Either the eligibility or the information wasn't, entered correctly.

434
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:45.790
P15: And, maybe the system is down because it says try again later, or it's giving me the other choice to complete, you know, continue to complete your application. It's kind of…

435
00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:56.479
P15: It's a bit confusing, so I really don't prefer the verbiage in Alert B.

436
00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:02.019
Moderator: I gotcha. Is it just because there is too many directions to take?

437
00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.780
P15: No, no, it's just…

438
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:12.599
P15: Well, it, you know, it says that they can't confirm the eligibility of the applicants. To try again later, or select continue, it's…

439
00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:17.539
P15: you know, when I see Try Again Later, I'm thinking.

440
00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:23.450
P15: Is the app down? You know, something…

441
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:27.389
P15: I… I think I would be frustrated if I tried

442
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:32.620
P15: To go back into the app or the program later.

443
00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:37.989
P15: And still, you know, come up with the same,

444
00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:45.329
P15: scenario. Gotcha. Where it's telling me I'm, the applicants, they're ineligible.

445
00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:54.169
Moderator: So, in this scenario, you wouldn't continue, you would try again later, and hopefully pass, because that, if not, that would frustrate you.

446
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.079
P15: Yes. Is that sound correct? Alright.

447
00:41:56.520 --> 00:42:05.329
Moderator: Thank you for that, and then we'll go ahead and go to Alert C. Same scenario, where you enter the veteran's information, and you see the following alert.

448
00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:19.759
P15: Okay, so this one states, that they cannot confirm the eligibility of the applicants, and if you think this is an error, check the information, so go back to the information that you entered.

449
00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:29.180
P15: and then it says, or select continue to complete your application. I would prefer

450
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:40.669
P15: that there was a link to take me backwards, so I can review the information. Why… why wouldn't you, go back and…

451
00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:44.849
P15: and re-verify your information.

452
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:53.690
P15: There's no… it… There's no sense in clicking continue to… It's a waste of time.

453
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:54.250
Moderator: Gotcha.

454
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.519
P15: You know, because it says that you're… there's an error.

455
00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:06.289
Moderator: Gotcha. So because of this message, you're likely to want to review your application basically resolve this issue.

456
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:07.519
P15: Yes, definitely.

457
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:12.859
Moderator: Okay, thank you for that. And then we can go ahead and move on to Alert D.

458
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:19.050
Moderator: Same scenario, you enter the veteran's information, and then you see this, this message.

459
00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:28.290
P15: Okay, then it says that, they found the veteran's information in the DEERS system for TRICARE.

460
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:42.099
P15: And then it says, even if you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHAMP VA benefits if you're eligible for TRICARE. So it's either one or the other. It's stating that

461
00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:47.700
P15: It did indeed find the veteran's information, and it's telling me

462
00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:54.049
P15: that he's already enrolled in TRICARE, and that you cannot have TRICARE and CHAMP VA.

463
00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:57.920
Moderator: Alright, and then if you see this message, what would you do?

464
00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.580
P15: I would then, maybe if there was a little,

465
00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.860
P15: a little link, for TRICARE.

466
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:12.810
P15: I would… If it was… if it was there, below this…

467
00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:17.420
P15: alert D, I would then, if it said something like.

468
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:27.339
P15: click here, this… this will… this link will take you to TRICARE Benefits. Gotcha. And then I would… I would look at that.

469
00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:31.130
Moderator: Gotcha. So you want to be redirected to TRICARE in this case.

470
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:32.070
P15: Definitely.

471
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:37.799
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then finally, for that last scenario, you're seeing this message here.

472
00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:49.330
P15: Okay, and this says, just based on the information provided, the applicants may be eligible for CHAMPBA. Select continue to complete your application.

473
00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:53.909
P15: This one has the checkmark.

474
00:44:53.930 --> 00:45:10.609
P15: And it's also in green, so you associate the green and a check mark with GO to proceed. Whereas, the other alerts, A through, D, have the,

475
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:24.829
P15: the triangle with, the exclamation point, you know, which to me is, hey, you know, read this. It's stopping, it's telling you, what is wrong.

476
00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:25.690
Moderator: Right.

477
00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:29.520
P15: And to, you know, review and result.

478
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:30.030
Moderator: Gotcha.

479
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.130
P15: issues.

480
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:38.400
Moderator: And then across all the alerts you saw, how confident do you feel that you know what to do on a scale of 1 to 5?

481
00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:42.590
Moderator: 1 being not very confident, and 5 being very confident.

482
00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:51.519
P15: Very confident, because it, it, tells you whether or not you are eligible and for what program.

483
00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:52.070
Moderator: Gotcha.

484
00:45:52.070 --> 00:46:04.809
P15: And then it tells you to go ahead and, in this case, the applicants may be eligible for the CHAMP VA, and select continue, so then I would be able to, go forth with the application.

485
00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:09.010
Moderator: So would that be a 4 or a 5 on this scale?

486
00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:09.600
P15: Bye.

487
00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:15.569
Moderator: 5, alright, thank you. And then, was there any other alert that was confusing or unclear to you?

488
00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.320
P15: the…

489
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:33.919
P15: the alert B, I didn't,

490
00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:42.250
P15: care for, try again later, or select continue. You know, as I mentioned, why would you select continue?

491
00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:49.850
P15: If it's… it's giving you that, That icon.

492
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:50.600
Moderator: Gotcha.

493
00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:53.719
P15: Telling you, you know, there's a warning there.

494
00:46:53.820 --> 00:47:00.280
P15: I would… and I really don't care for it, you can try later. As I mentioned.

495
00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:12.440
P15: you know, I'm thinking, is the app down? Is the system down? I don't want to waste my time, trying to, try again later.

496
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:19.419
P15: I like, Alert A. It says that

497
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:33.110
P15: the information of the applicants cannot be confirmed, or eligibility. And it also states that they couldn't, find the veteran's information in their system.

498
00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:45.249
P15: And as I mentioned before, maybe if there was a drop-down or a link that you could click on to go backwards and check the veteran's information for its accuracy.

499
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:46.490
Moderator: Gotcha.

500
00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:50.169
P15: I don't prefer the Alert B.

501
00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:52.840
P15: And…

502
00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:00.789
P15: really, alert B, I don't care for.

503
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:08.509
Moderator: I gotcha. Alright, thank you for that. We can move along to the next portion. Go ahead and click on that prototype menu button there.

504
00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.500
Moderator: And then scroll down to the very bottom.

505
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.759
Moderator: You'll see the summary cards. Click on that.

506
00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:32.299
Moderator: So, in the screen, you'll see four summary cards. The first two, Card Style A, are from the prototypes we just went through. The third and fourth card, Card Style B, are alternative designs. Please take a few moments to take a look at all four before we talk about them.

507
00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:00.140
P15: Okay.

508
00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.239
Moderator: What do you think each card is telling you?

509
00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:12.100
P15: The left, in cardstyle A, the left,

510
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:15.680
Moderator: Yeah, information. Yes.

511
00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:24.380
P15: It, again, has the green check mark, so it's, it's telling the applicant

512
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:31.969
P15: According to the responses, they may be eligible, for the CHAMP VA.

513
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:38.000
P15: It's also telling the veteran or applicant that they're not eligible for TRICARE.

514
00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:42.439
P15: So, I do like that.

515
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:47.199
P15: And then the box on the right?

516
00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:54.129
P15: Based on the information of the veteran's information and the applicant's.

517
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:59.959
P15: That they may not be eligible according to the responses they entered.

518
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:05.229
P15: So, it has a check mark, and apparently…

519
00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:18.509
P15: The veteran qualifies according to their disability, service-connected disability, or they passed, due, due to their service-connected disability, or

520
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:25.780
P15: The veteran at the time of their demise was rated permanently and totally disabled.

521
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:29.500
P15: From their, service-connected disability.

522
00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:44.819
P15: And then it's also telling me, if we're applying for the CHAMP VA, it's stating that the veteran or the applicant is not eligible for TRICARE. So, you know, again, you can't be,

523
00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:48.169
P15: You can't be in both programs, it's one or the other.

524
00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:49.810
Moderator: Gotcha.

525
00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:00.040
P15: Do you want me to talk about the cart style B?

526
00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:04.259
Moderator: Yeah, if you want to summarize what you think it's saying.

527
00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:09.430
P15: Alright, and, based on the information that was entered.

528
00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:14.070
P15: On the left side, the left, box.

529
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:30.690
P15: Again, tells… tells me, that they meet the prerequisite, regarding the, disability, or,

530
00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:43.980
P15: the veteran died from their disability, or the veteran at the time of their demise was rated permanently and totally disabled. And it also states

531
00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:50.319
P15: that, the veteran or the applicants are not eligible for TRICARE.

532
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:55.560
P15: So, I mean, that's pretty straightforward.

533
00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:00.750
P15: Then the right, box states,

534
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:14.880
P15: Why the applicant or the veteran may not be eligible, and these responses, are…

535
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.969
P15: the prerequisites for CHAMPBA.

536
00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.780
P15: And it talks about,

537
00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:39.179
P15: they must have met one or the other, or one of the three choices. The veteran is totally disabled from their service-connected disability, the veteran died from their service-connected disability, or the veteran at their demise was rated

538
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:43.929
P15: Permanently and totally disabled from their service-connected disability.

539
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:49.450
P15: And then the… the bottom,

540
00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:53.990
P15: I want to say bullet, but the next sentence states.

541
00:52:54.260 --> 00:53:00.999
P15: It's got an X red, so it tells me to stop. The veteran or the applicant

542
00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:03.310
P15: is eligible for TRICARE.

543
00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:07.900
P15: So, you know, the top portion.

544
00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:17.069
P15: they did meet the requirements for CHAMP VA, and it's also telling me that the veteran or the applicant

545
00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:20.549
P15: is… eligible for TRICARE.

546
00:53:21.410 --> 00:53:28.719
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then we are reaching the end of our 60-minute, can I get a 5 extra minutes with you here?

547
00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.460
P15: Sure.

548
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:38.789
Moderator: Alright, thank you. And then, based on what you just went through with these four cards, which set was the easiest to understand at a glance?

549
00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.970
P15: they're…

550
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:01.540
P15: It is not,

551
00:54:08.830 --> 00:54:10.260
P15: Are they the same?

552
00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:18.760
Moderator: No, they're slightly different, but I'm curious if there is a set that's easier for you to understand.

553
00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:25.290
P15: I would say the cardstyle B, because… It states,

554
00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:40.370
P15: based on the, information entered, it's telling you the eligibility, for CHAMP VA. It's got both of the, check marks,

555
00:54:41.250 --> 00:54:46.709
P15: Stating why they're eligible, that they met that criteria.

556
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.570
P15: Okay. And,

557
00:54:51.080 --> 00:55:01.780
P15: Then it also states a summary of why they may not be eligible. The top portion shows

558
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:05.919
P15: They met some of the prerequisites.

559
00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:13.649
P15: And, it's also telling you that the veteran or the applicant is eligible for TRICARE.

560
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:15.110
P15: Gotcha.

561
00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:19.600
Moderator: So CartStyle B is a little bit easier for you to understand.

562
00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.280
P15: Yes.

563
00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:25.389
Moderator: And then, are there any parts of the car that felt, unclear or confusing?

564
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:37.470
P15: No, but I like the card style B because it's telling you, perhaps it, you know, maybe it's reminding you that

565
00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:42.250
P15: This is for CHAMP VA, and…

566
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:49.770
P15: Either you met the eligibility, or according to the information you entered.

567
00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:53.299
P15: you didn't meet all of the criteria for champion.

568
00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.569
Moderator: Gotcha. So that little blur…

569
00:55:54.570 --> 00:55:56.010
P15: Yes.

570
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:57.700
Moderator: That little blurb is helpful.

571
00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:05.080
P15: Yes, and it's also telling you that, the veteran or the applicant is eligible for TRICARE.

572
00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:11.750
Moderator: I gotcha. Thank you for that. And then that is the end of our screen share, so you no longer have to…

573
00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:14.209
Moderator: You can stop your screen share now.

574
00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:15.080
P15: Okay.

575
00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:21.949
Moderator: And then, is there any other feedback?

576
00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:25.630
Moderator: You can click on the stop share.

577
00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:32.960
Moderator: Alright, is there any other feedback you would like to add about the two prototype and the messages that you saw today?

578
00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:36.390
P15: Nope, nope.

579
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:43.120
Moderator: Okay, and then, do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

580
00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:46.619
P15: Do I have a preference?

581
00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:47.270
Moderator: Yeah.

582
00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:53.819
Moderator: For how, like, eligibility clarification works on an online form.

583
00:56:54.010 --> 00:56:55.399
P15: Yes.

584
00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:58.839
Moderator: Do you have a preference for how that works?

585
00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.559
Moderator: Like, how you want to be presented with that information.

586
00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:04.710
P15: Well…

587
00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:11.899
P15: Perhaps I'm not on the same page as you.

588
00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:29.159
Moderator: Maybe let me rephrase the question here, but is there a way that you want that information to be presented to you, so that you can go through and see if you're eligible for, in this case, Champa or not?

589
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:34.679
P15: Perhaps if, I was alerted

590
00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:48.500
P15: perhaps I'm the spouse or a dependent child. I would prefer… A email, if…

591
00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:55.669
P15: the, you know, dependent spouse or the veteran, has given the VA

592
00:57:55.890 --> 00:58:13.710
P15: permission to email. I would state, based on the, criteria, maybe the email states you're, you may be eligible, and or your spouse dependents for CHAMP VA, or…

593
00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:21.929
P15: maybe it's for TRICARE. Maybe receiving an email and,

594
00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:31.959
P15: you know, maybe alerting the veteran, that they may be eligible for TRICARE, and, you know, push on this, and…

595
00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:36.819

Moderator: For the…

597
00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:40.520
P15: The benefit application.

598
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:45.919
Moderator: So you want it to be reached out to see if there are things that you qualified for, essentially.

599
00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:47.189

601
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:51.780
P15: Nope.

602
00:58:51.980 --> 00:59:00.729

Moderator: all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and it's only… and we'll only share the video with our VA partners for the purposes of improving VA.gov and the other digital experiences. And then, I just want to say we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today.

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:50.160
Moderator: their family members. And then lastly, Prejin will send you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can use to pass along to other veterans that you may know that would want to participate in future studies like this. And, thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day.

608
00:59:50.450 --> 00:59:52.389
P15: Same to you. Thank you so much.
