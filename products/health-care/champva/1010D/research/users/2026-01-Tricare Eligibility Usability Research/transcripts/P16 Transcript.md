00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.180
Moderator: I have started the recording. I'd like to confirm that you are comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

2
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.690
P16: Yes.

3
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:21.159
Moderator: Alright, and then are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that could be used to identify you?

4
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.470
P16: Yes.

5
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.199
Moderator: Alright, thank you for that. And then I have a couple of warm-up questions for you.

6
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.710
Moderator: Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program for the… of the Department of Veterans Affairs, or the CHAMPA program?

7
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.739
P16: I've never heard of it.

8
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.490
Moderator: Okay, so you haven't heard of it either.

9
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.979
P16: Oh, I have.

10
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.759
P16: I never heard of until this morning I read.

11
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.750
P16: A clip on… Facebook.

12
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.260
Moderator: Okay.

13
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.270
P16: But it had it in it.

14
00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.629
Moderator: Have you… or are you able to explain to me in your own word what you think the eligibility of that program is?

15
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.849
P16: So, now that I read it, it's not the same thing I thought it was.

16
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:24.149
P16: I thought it was AI taking over for, like, the… Personnel, like, taking civilians, doing VA claims.

17
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.529
P16: But I guess it's not the same.

18
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.160
Moderator: Okay, I gotcha.

19
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.359
Moderator: And then, have you ever heard of TRICARE?

20
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.140
P16: Yeah, our track here.

21
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.189
Moderator: I gotcha. And then you said, so you read a little bit of the CHAMP VA as well, correct?

22
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.600
P16: Yeah, but it's… I just like, is it not the same as track here?

23
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.180
P16: Beerfront.

24
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.150
Moderator: So I would like to ask if you… if you… you can explain the difference.

25
00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.490
P16: Like, one is… Oh… Well, I always thought TRICARE was just for military.

26
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.279
P16: Hmm… are veterans, as far as…

27
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.690
P16: Serving the actual member that served.

28
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.000
P16: And they're, Immediate family.

29
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.599
P16: And then… Duh… VA was just for the service member.

30
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.259
P16: That's not correct, that's what I thought it was, but that's what I think.

31
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:43.850
Moderator: Oh, that's fine. Alright, thank you for that. So I'm gonna share a link with you in the chat of the prototype, and then I want you to open it in your browser, and then share your Zoom screen. But before that, I'd like to confirm that… so you have a laptop or a desktop in this.

32
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.490
P16: Laptop, yes.

33
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.279
Moderator: Okay, great, I got that.

34
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.850
Moderator: So I have pasted the link in, chat. Go ahead and click on that. It takes a little bit of time to load.

35
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.960
P16: Oh, is it Figma?

36
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.020
Moderator: Yeah.

37
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.589
Moderator: And then let me know once you're… that's loaded, and then you're able to screen share.

38
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.630
P16: Alright, it's loaded, and how do I screen share?

39
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:51.360
Moderator: Okay, at the bottom of your Zoom screen, there should be a couple different buttons. There's one that says, and then probably in the center, it says share with the arrow pointing up.

40
00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:04.150
Moderator: If you click on that, you should be able to select what you're… what you can share, and I want you to share the browser that has that Figma… that Figma demo.

41
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.200
P16: Send an arrow pointing up?

42
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.050
Moderator: Yeah.

43
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.630
P16: I got an arrow and a square pointing down.

44
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.249
Moderator: Pointing down, you said? Does it… what is the,

45
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.929
Moderator: What does the word say? Is it share?

46
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.190
P16: No, it doesn't… when I highlight it, nothing comes up.

47
00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.030
Moderator: Are you looking at the Zoom screen right now?

48
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.520
P16: Yeah, I'm… is…

49
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.330
P16: If I'm looking… I'm looking at it…

50
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.179
P16: It's to the left of your… Face on my screen.

51
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.369
P16: On the corner.

52
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.180
Moderator: Gotcha.

53
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.350
P16: Warner.

54
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.710
Moderator: Bottom corner to left, so is there any other icons that you see down there?

55
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.000
P16: Video and microphone emblem.

56
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.850
P16: And then… Oh my gosh.

57
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.739
P16: There's a drop-down.

58
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.970
P16: Nope.

59
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.649
P16: Nothing was dropped down.

60
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.809
Moderator: You might have to… there might be, like, a more option.

61
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.520
Moderator: So, on the Zoom screen, on the audio and video, to the right of that, there should be

62
00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.000
Moderator: other, icons as well. Do you not see it on your screen?

63
00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:33.340
P16: Yeah, and like… So the arrow is pointing down, just click on that one.

64
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.099
Moderator: What does the arrow pointing down say?

65
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.709
P16: I didn't see anything, it's just…

66
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:40.910
Moderator: and say anything?

67
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.029
P16: It's like a 3 quarter square around it.

68
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.710
Moderator: Okay, try to click on that, see if it does anything.

69
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.000
P16: You just disappeared.

70
00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:05.390
Moderator: I gotcha. So, it sounds like you are on one of the smaller screen settings.

71
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:17.899
Moderator: You might have to, expand your window, so your chat window, make it bigger.

72
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:24.340
Moderator: Or, or your Zoom screen, make it, like, full.

73
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.479
Moderator: Both sides or something.

74
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:41.849
Moderator: And then you should be able to see the other buttons, because it sounds like you have a, like, a miniature version of it, like a smaller window size for the Zoom screen.

75
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.680
P16: Okay…

76
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.150
P16: Oh, I gotta see where…

77
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.529
P16: Does that work?

78
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.080
Moderator: Not seeing anything on my end.

79
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.990
Moderator: What are you seeing on your screen? Nothing?

80
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:15.879
P16: Choose what to share with me. Okay.

81
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.119
Moderator: then you can choose, like, the browser that has the Figma.

82
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.669
Moderator: So it sounds like you can see the shared option now.

83
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:29.849
P16: Yeah, I'm… so, where do I click? The window? Oh, entire screen?

84
00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.300
Moderator: Choose the window.

85
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.100
P16: A window.

86
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:39.950
P16: Got it.

87
00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:45.519
Moderator: Alright, I, assess that you're starting to share screen here.

88
00:08:47.139 --> 00:08:49.659
Moderator: Give it a few moments to load here.

89
00:08:54.989 --> 00:08:59.029
Moderator: I'm only seeing… okay, I see myself. Okay, great.

90
00:08:59.079 --> 00:09:00.569
P16: Now I see the…

91
00:09:00.569 --> 00:09:01.839
Moderator: The research screen.

92
00:09:03.789 --> 00:09:14.449
Moderator: Alright, for this first portion, you see two buttons here, the prototype blueberry, and then Prototype pineapple. Go ahead and click on the blueberry one.

93
00:09:23.739 --> 00:09:31.829
Moderator: So on this first page, please take a minute or so to look over the instructions, and when you're ready, in your own word, tell me what this means to you.

94
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.670
P16: Was this for, sounds like it's for…

95
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.459
P16: Prep, the… the veteran passes away.

96
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.300
P16: Depends how… Insurance.

97
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.330
Moderator: Okay, that's what it sounds like to you?

98
00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:30.510
Moderator: And then, you can scroll down to read the rest of the page as well.

99
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.430
P16: Yeah, the zoom buttons.

100
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.560
P16: Messing up my… Page down.

101
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:50.290
Moderator: On the side there, there is the… that…

102
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.340
Moderator: I think you… you're able to see the…

103
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.729
Moderator: Or you can't see it at all.

104
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.340
P16: I can't see the scroll button.

105
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.859
P16: Over here on the side.

106
00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.450
Moderator: Yeah.

107
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.839
P16: It's not letting me scroll, hold on. Let me go full…

108
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.210
Moderator: And you can't scroll at all on your… on your mouse?

109
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.519
P16: Oh, it won't let me scroll.

110
00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.010
P16: What is going on?

111
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:43.210
P16: Mmm…

112
00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:57.930
Moderator: It sounds like you're, using the… Arrow up and down.

113
00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.329
Moderator: Key, does that sound accurate?

114
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.700
P16: Yeah, I was trying to.

115
00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:06.779
Moderator: Do you have a wheel on your mouse to go up and down?

116
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.810
P16: I don't.

117
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.920
P16: Can you see my… can you… I just have a pad.

118
00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:17.470
Moderator: I gotcha. Are you able to use the pad to…

119
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:21.620
Moderator: Like, the arrow on the pads, or not at all there?

120
00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:24.940
P16: Yeah, can you see me scrolling around with the arrow?

121
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.109
Moderator: I see you moving the arrow around, but I don't.

122
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.780
P16: Yeah, huh.

123
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:28.150
Moderator: Crawling.

124
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.820
P16: on this side… On this side, as there's no scroll.

125
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.900
Moderator: I gotcha.

126
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:35.960
Moderator: Okay.

127
00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:38.180
Moderator: Hmm.

128
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:44.309
Moderator: Are you able to click on the page and then move it up? If not, I have a backup.

129
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.660
P16: And now I can take over.

130
00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.890
Moderator: No? Alright.

131
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:55.259
Moderator: That's… that's fine. I can take over and screen share instead. That might be a little bit easier for you.

132
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.899
Moderator: So you can stop screen sharing now.

133
00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.769
Moderator: So, give me a second while I set this up.

134
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:22.810
P16: Oh. It's not a… It lets me use… I have arrows at the bottom.

135
00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.869
Moderator: But you can't scroll down to the bottom of the page, is that… does that sound correct?

136
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:35.160
P16: Yeah, oh, it's not, there's more to it, okay? Yeah. Honestly, no.

137
00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.799
Moderator: I want you to be able to read the bottom of this page here, but it sounds like

138
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:45.290
Moderator: Your, screen, or this… Prototype won't let you scroll.

139
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:49.389
Moderator: Which is okay, I can…

140
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.500
P16: Found one bad thing.

141
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.690
Moderator: Yeah.

142
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.200
Moderator: I can take over, and then, screen shared my screen instead.

143
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.860
P16: Okay, so, stop screen share.

144
00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:01.760
Moderator: Yes, please.

145
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.320
P16: Okay, gotcha.

146
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.490
Moderator: Alrighty, do you see my screen for the two prototypes?

147
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.949
P16: Yeah, it's a little blurry, but I…

148
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:24.950
Moderator: Okay. Remembering.

149
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.539
Moderator: Let me make it.

150
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.970
Moderator: Like this, maybe?

151
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:37.130
P16: Yep, I see… I can… I can, decipher.

152
00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.860
Moderator: You can… okay, great. So.

153
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.980
P16: For the first task here.

154
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.130
Moderator: I'm gonna go into the prototype blueberry.

155
00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.559
Moderator: And then, again, I'll have you read through this.

156
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.929
Moderator: And then, I believe you start at the top portion here, and then I'm gonna scroll.

157
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:55.320
P16: content.

158
00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:00.150
Moderator: Bottom So, I'll stop right here. Go ahead.

159
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:00.970
P16: Alright.

Moderator: Alright, in your own word, what.

166
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:16.090
P16: In your own word, what is this application for? Checking the eligibility.

167
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:17.710
Moderator: Or what?

168
00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.839
P16: For the program?

169
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.219
Moderator: Okay, and then, who is eligible to apply?

170
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:36.820
P16: And… The dependent, spouse… I guess, immediate family, I would say.

171
00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:40.949
Moderator: And then, do you see any reason you might not be eligible?

172
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:55.699
P16: Yeah, if you have TRICARE, it's basically you can't have two insurances.

173
00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:00.350
Moderator: Okay, can't have two insurance, and then you mentioned TRICARE here?

174
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:09.490
Moderator: Alright. And then, if you weren't sure whether you qualify, where on this page would you look?

175
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.470

Moderator: And then, I want to draw your attention to the line just below that. It says, we'll also help you check your eligibility when you complete this form.

178
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:27.520
Moderator: What is your expectation, if any, when you read this sentence?

P16: If you complete the form, someone can help you.

180
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:50.710

181
00:17:53.440 --> 00:18:00.389
P16: Someone will help you when you complete the form, but if you can't complete the form, you need help before you

182
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.880
P16: Or if you need help before you can complete the form. I think it needs to go above it.

183
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.450
Moderator: I gotcha.

184
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.740
Moderator: And then… Is there anything that makes you uncertain about applying?

185
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:18.230
P16: View… I mean, if you have TRICARE, and…

186
00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:26.030
P16: You gonna lose… will you lose your TRICARE if you… A prayer for this.

187
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.599
P16: Or it is… This program might…

188
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:36.900
P16: have stuff that the TRICARE doesn't have. Like, it's uncertain of…

189
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:45.989
P16: It's not letting me… I guess you gotta go in, but it's not giving me answers that if I apply for this, why lose my track here?

190
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:51.439
Moderator: I gotcha. So, in this case, would you continue, or you want more information first?

191
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.380
P16: I want more information.

192
00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.570
Moderator: Gotcha.

193
00:18:55.050 --> 00:19:01.020
Moderator: And then, so in regards to how this benefit impacts TRICARE, does that sound correct?

194
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:11.160
P16: Yeah, basically, fact… effect… For that section.

195
00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:23.089
Moderator: Gotcha. And then on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very poorly, and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about this application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

196
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.929
P16: Not… not informed. I'll… I'll give it up.

197
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:34.879
P16: I'll give it a 2, because I'm not gonna fill this out before I know.

198
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:42.439
Moderator: I gotcha. So you want more information, a lot more information before you would fill it out.

199
00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.620
P16: Yes.

200
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:52.999

P16: Oh…

258
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.499
P16: So, saying I don't know that…

259
00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:12.970
P16: So, if they mark no, they're not.

260
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:21.650
P16: So now I would… I would check to make sure, see if I'm eligible for TRICARE. If I don't have TRICARE.

261
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.100
P16: Because it seemed like I should be able…

262
00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:31.189
P16: If you're telling me that I should check to see if I'm eligible for TRICARE,

263
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.910
P16: Then 9 times out of 10, it's telling you that

264
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:39.160
P16: Hey, you're probably eligible for TRICARE.

265
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:50.820
P16: That's what I… that's how I would feel. Like, if they're asking you to check for it, then obviously maybe you should be getting TRICARE.

333
00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:32.390
P16: No, it was easy. It was two check marks.

334
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.469
Moderator: Okay, and then would that be a 4 or a 5?

335
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:39.420
P16: Give it a 4.

336
00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.300
Moderator: 4?

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:09.680
P16: That red box is helpful. It lets me know I'm not, eligible for the benefits quick.

P16: But… I would.

397
00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:16.920
Moderator: So does this system feel like it's helping you understand your option, or is the system blocking you from applying?

398
00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.739
P16: I mean, the system's telling me that I'm not…

399
00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:27.760
P16: eligible, but I haven't clicked continue yet to see if…

Moderator: Right.

405
00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:51.030

415
00:38:54.390 --> 00:39:02.169
P16: Yeah, without… I mean, I didn't read it, but it looked like it's… it gives you the check marks and the X's.

416
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:14.779
Moderator: And then, what, would you take the same or different action as the previous, as the other prototype? So, in the other prototype, you click to continue. This one, would you continue?

417
00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:19.200
P16: So…

418
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:29.790
P16: This one tells you you… You didn't meet it.

419
00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:32.730
P16: The other one, checked deers.

420
00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:37.560
P16: I mean, it did it for you. It's very streamlined.

421
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.020
P16: A huge queen.

422
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:40.929
P16: So, I mean, it's…

423
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.750
P16: It's okay.

424
00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.940
P16: I mean, is it right?

425
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.740
P16: I don't know, but… It's definitely better than the other one.

426
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:55.490
Moderator: Okay.

427
00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:00.980
Moderator: And can you elaborate on that? Could you explain your thought process there?

428
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:05.460
P16: You filled it out, you filled out every… everything.

429
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:15.889
P16: And then… you get two green checkmarks, but… When in actuality, when… Someone read your,

430
00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:21.340
P16: Your application, and they find out…

431
00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:27.159
P16: They check your eligibility, and you're not really eligible, you're holding up

432
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:34.020
P16: Progress that it could be checking Someone that actually… does qualify.

433
00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:36.039
Moderator: Okay, and then…

434
00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:36.900
P16: Fence.

435
00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:44.569

436
00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.809
P16: I would exit.

437
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:49.350
Moderator: Okay, because…

438
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:54.859
P16: But, I definitely… Check twice.

439
00:40:55.290 --> 00:41:02.379
Moderator: I gotcha. So you would exit here, but in actuality, you would go back to your answers and check twice.

440
00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:09.239
P16: Yeah, I would… I would… Use the contact us at the bottom.

441
00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.530
Moderator: Gotcha. That makes you…

442
00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:21.829
Moderator: And then, on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this second prototype here?

443
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:23.779
P16: There's a 5.

444
00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:25.060
Moderator: It's a 5.

445
00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.600
P16: It's here, too.

446
00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.409
Moderator: I mean, I don't understand it.

447
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.160
Moderator: Sorry, a 5 is very easy. Are you saying this is very easy?

448
00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:41.020
P16: Yeah, now, but I… It's easier, yeah. 5 is easy.

449
00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.010
Moderator: Gotcha. So you would rate this as a 5.

450
00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:57.249
Moderator: And now, comparing the two prototypes, so the first one, the blueberry, and this one, the second one, the pineapple, which of the two prototypes would you prefer to use?

451
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.260
P16: No.

452
00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:00.500
P16: Pineapple.

454
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:09.529
P16: It does all the… it does the work for you.

455
00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:13.419
Moderator: Okay, so you like that system check, that it did.

456
00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:13.740
P16: I knew.

457
00:42:14.350 --> 00:42:15.540
Moderator: I gotcha.

458
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:24.979
Moderator: And then, thinking about everything that you saw today, was there too much info- was there too much, too little, or about the right amount of information?

459
00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:29.219
P16: Too little.

460
00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.330
Moderator: Too little.

461
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.250
P16: Yeah.

462
00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.429

P16: Yeah, more clarification on… Before you even get to… Putting in your social.

464
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:49.699

465
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.670
P16: Yeah, before starting the application.

466
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:58.099
Moderator: Alright, and then if you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident in doing so?

467
00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:00.680
P16: Yes.

468
00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:02.060
Moderator: Alright.

469
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.729

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:15.199
Moderator: So we have finished the two prototypes. There's a couple of additional messages and scenarios I want to go through with you here.

471
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:21.159
Moderator: The first one is the warning alerts. So, for the warning alert,

472
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:32.650
Moderator: I'll read you the scenario, and then you'll review the message, and then please kind of state any questions that you may have, or could provide. So, in the first scenario, Alert A,

473
00:43:32.650 --> 00:43:43.530

480
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:30.060
P16: Yep.

481
00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:33.330
Moderator: And then, if you still see this message, what would you do?

482
00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:42.450
P16: Check it again, but then… if it's still wrong, then I would… Contact the system, or the…

P16: As far as me knowing what to do?

527
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.150
Moderator: Yeah.

528
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:40.470
P16: Do I… Base each alert, or just overall?

529
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.970
Moderator: Overall.

530
00:48:53.060 --> 00:49:00.169

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:11.569
Moderator: Okay, so like a 3? Does that sound appropriate? Yeah. All right.

533
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:16.669
Moderator: And then, was there any confusing… was any alert confusing or unclear to you?

534
00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:20.099
P16: Nope, none were.

535
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.750
Moderator: Confusing or unclear, it's just…

536
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:28.890
P16: Gotta check… gotta check everything.

537
00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:36.189
Moderator: Gotcha. We are running up to the hour here. Is it okay if I get, like, 5 minutes of extra of your time?

538
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:37.740
P16: Oh yeah, go ahead.

539
00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.090
Moderator: Okay, thank you.

541
00:49:46.050 --> 00:50:00.259
Moderator: So on this screen here, you'll find four different, summary cards. The first two, Card Style A, are from the two prototypes that we just went through, and then the… and then for cardstyle B, are,

542
00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:07.010
Moderator: our alternative designs. So please take a few moments to look at all four, and then we'll talk about it.

543
00:50:20.330 --> 00:50:22.139
P16: These are, like, summaries.

544
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.590
Moderator: Okay.

545
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.240
P16: Excuse me.

546
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:40.670
Moderator: And then let me know when you're ready so I can… or let me know when you want me to scroll down to the cardstyle B.

547
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:44.940
P16: Oh, okay.

548
00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:13.190
P16: Okay.

549
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:18.859
Moderator: Okay, so, What do you think each car is telling you?

550
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.469
P16: I was telling you of your…

551
00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.570
P16: Eligible or not eligible?

552
00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:34.899
P16: And it's giving you the reasons why.

553
00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:44.769
Moderator: Gotcha. And then… I want to draw your attention to the content just above the checkmark.

554
00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:49.310
Moderator: There's a slight difference between the car style A and the car style B.

555
00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:58.280
P16: One second… So I'm looking at car style B.

556
00:51:59.130 --> 00:52:02.330
P16: Based on the veteran's information, the applicants.

557
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:05.440
P16: may be eligible.

558
00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:11.359

Moderator: So, which set is the easiest for you to understand?

569
00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:33.110
Moderator: Is it cart style A, these first two, or cardstyle B, the second two?

570
00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:39.900
P16: Oh, neverminds.

571
00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:42.280

Moderator: Why is that?

575
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:53.430
P16: I know what I'm looking at tells you.

576
00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:55.210
P16: If you're eligible or not.

577
00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:59.130
P16: Have you… Have you met the requirements?

578
00:54:00.250 --> 00:54:07.890
Moderator: Okay, I'm sorry, could you clarify what specifically makes it clearer than Then card style A.

579
00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:17.490
P16: Well, I don't like… Your responses…

580
00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.000
P16: And all the eligibility requirements, which…

581
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:24.020
P16: The responsive denied me all the eligibility.

582
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.530
P16: Or unfortunate.

583
00:54:40.490 --> 00:54:43.050
P16: It doesn't.

584
00:54:43.230 --> 00:54:44.970
P16: It doesn't explain.

585
00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.369
P16: It doesn't ex… It doesn't explain it.

586
00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:54.459
P16: Like, before, it just says your responses.

587
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:55.960
P16: Oh, Lord.

588
00:54:56.310 --> 00:55:01.510
Moderator: So you're saying, cardstyle A doesn't explain, whereas cardstyle B does explain it?

589
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:02.280
P16: Yes.

590
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.380
Moderator: I gotcha. And then, was there any other part of the card that was confusing or unclear?

591
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:10.560
P16: Nope.

592
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:12.280

Moderator: Is there any other feedback you want to add about the tube prototype and the messages that you saw today?

596
00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:37.660
P16: Just more… More context.

597
00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:41.800

Moderator: Gotcha.

603
00:55:56.950 --> 00:56:02.160
Moderator: And then, do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

604
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:05.560
P16: Like, how…

605
00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:07.760
Moderator: Go ahead.

606
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:12.430
P16: You said how… Clarity should be added?

607
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:16.520
Moderator: Legibility clarity should be added to an online form.

608
00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:22.070
P16: Mmm… Information.

609
00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:26.140
Moderator: Yeah. Like, what kind of information you would want around that.

610
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:31.930
P16: Why was it for… like…

611
00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:37.090

614
00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:43.170
P16: No, sir.

615
00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:51.410
Moderator: Alright, I want to circle back and reconfirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?

616
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:52.819
P16: Oh, yes.

617
00:56:53.020 --> 00:57:09.190
Moderator: And then, just to remind you, we do remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and then it will only be shared… we would only share the video within the VA partners for the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

618
00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:17.790
Moderator: And then, we really appreciate you taking your time to share your thoughts with us today. It'd be super helpful for us to continue working on the site.

619
00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:33.040
Moderator: To make sure it works for all veterans and their family members. And then lastly, region wants to, or will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know for a chance for them to participate in, like, future studies like this.

620
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:38.000
Moderator: And then, again, thank you a lot, and enjoy the rest of your day.

621
00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:39.500
