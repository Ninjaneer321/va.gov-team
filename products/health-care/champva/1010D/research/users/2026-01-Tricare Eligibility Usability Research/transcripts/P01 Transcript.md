00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:09.210
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording, and I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.040
P1: Yes, that's fine.

3
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:20.629
Renata: And are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.780
P1: Yes, that's fine as well.

5
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:34.840
Renata: All right, thank you, John. So, before we look at the website, just wanted to start with a few warm-up questions. Have you ever applied to the Civilian Health and Medical Program at the Department of Veterans Affairs or CHAMP VA program before?

6
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.700
P1: I have not.

7
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.320
Renata: Alright, and have you heard about the CHAMP VA program?

8
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.900
P1: I…

9
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.140
P1: the acronym sounds familiar, but I don't know a whole lot about it. I think, you know, they may have mentioned it some time during the transition, or some of my VA appointments, but that's all I know of it.

10
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.589
Renata: Okay, got it. And have you ever heard of TRICARE?

11
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.390
P1: Yes.

12
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.089
Renata: Okay. And, to your best ability, could you explain the difference between TRICARE and CHAMPVA?

13
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.270
P1: Well, I believe,

14
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.499
P1: I guess, if it's considered, like, TRICARE standard, or just TRICARE in general, is the… Is the,

15
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.189
P1: Medical coverage that active duty military members get, and then there's options for…

16
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.569
P1: post, you know, like, retirement, like, I have TRICARE Prime now, so that's for myself and family.

17
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.050
P1: since, you know, transitioning from active duty, and then sounds like CHAMP is specific to

18
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:38.609
P1: veterans. I'm not sure if it's only for 100% disabled, or it is veterans in general, but…

19
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:55.840
P1: Sounds like, from my understanding, the differences are, TRICARE is active duty and retirees, and or retirees, and CHAMP is, maybe veterans who haven't retired. You just, you know, provided some service throughout, you know, at some point in time, you were in the military.

20
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:08.590
Renata: Got it, thank you. So at this point, I'm going to share a link with you of the pro… one of the prototypes that we're going to look at today. I just wanted to confirm, are you on a computer, tablet, phone? Computer.

21
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.970
P1: Laptop.

22
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:26.929
Renata: Okay, got it. So I'm gonna share that, link in the, Zoom chat. Gonna give you a moment to, like, close any windows or tabs that you have opened, because, I'll have you open the link that I'm gonna share, and then share your screen.

23
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:27.470
P1: Okay.

24
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.860
Renata: So once you're ready, click on the link in the Zoom chat, let that load, and then I can walk you through sharing screen if you have any difficulties.

25
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.710
P1: Okay.

26
00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:13.709
Renata: All right. You can… where it says Flows on the left-hand side, and there's an X, you can just click the X there, and close that out. It'll make it a little bit bigger. Cool. Alright, so I'm going to, for the first task, have you click that blue button that says Prototype Blueberry.

27
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.929
Renata: Okay, so on this first page, just take a minute or so to look over the instructions, and when you're ready, in your own words, tell me what this page means to you.

28
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.160
P1: Okay.

29
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.650
P1: It looks like a standard VA, sort of, initial page that…

30
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.900
P1: you would come to if you're applying for a benefit? This particular benefit is CHAMP VA?

31
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.540
Renata: Got it. And in your own words, who is this application for?

32
00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.319
P1: Spouse, dependent, or survivor, or a veteran, or service member who meets the criteria?

33
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.900
Renata: Got it. So, who would be eligible to apply based on the content on this page?

34
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.890
P1: Looks like, eligibility would be for…

35
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.370
P1: The spouse of a service member, dependent.

36
00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.289
P1: Or a survivor of a veteran, or the member themselves.

37
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.840
P1: Who qualify for the health insurance?

38
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:32.099
Renata: Got it. And do you see any other reasons you might not be… you may or may not be eligible to apply?

39
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:52.329
P1: That always is that back and forth, where you're just like, everybody knows that we need this waiver, and then it's like, it's, you know, for them, they're gonna approve it, and it's fine, but it's the formality of it. I guess most people…

40
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.030
P1: Should.

41
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.800
P1: Click on this link to see if they're eligible.

42
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.909
P1: I would imagine that's where it would give you the… Specific criteria and any disqualifiers?

43
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:17.620
Renata: Gotcha. I want to draw your attention right below that link where it says, we'll help… also help you check your eligibility when you complete this form. What are your expectations, if any, when you read this sentence?

44
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:27.300
P1: I guess, once you go through, Inputting your information, you know, with hopes of… Applying.

45
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.960
P1: Once your information is inputted, the system will tell you whether or not you're eligible.

46
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.000
Renata: Got it. Is there anything on this page that makes you uncertain about applying for CHAMP VA?

47
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.730
P1: No, I wouldn't say, any uncertainties. I think all… all of the VA…

48
00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.880
P1: Pages… just have too much information.

49
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.000
P1: like, I think a lot of this information is repetitive in one way or another, but…

50
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:11.050
P1: It just feels like all the VA pages are just crowded with a lot of information. I personally would just, you know, prefer something that says, like.

51
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.289
P1: Check your ability… check your eligibility, apply.

52
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.229
P1: And maybe, you know,

53
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.210
P1: Maybe something along the lines of what information you may need to apply.

54
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.360
Renata: Got it. Okay.

55
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:33.170
Renata: Would you continue and apply right now, or would you want more information, at this point?

56
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.279
P1: I would… I would probably just continue with the application.

57
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:49.689
Renata: Okay. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

58
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:59.730
P1: I would say 4. I mean, I think it gives you the information you need to at least be comfortable with, you know, moving forward.

59
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.200
P1: And the info… and whether or not you're eligible?

60
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:16.289
Renata: Got it, thank you. So at this point, you can scroll down, the page, and in that big blue box underneath sign in or create an account, there's a link that says Start Your Form Without Signing In. You can click that.

61
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.610
Renata: So…

62
00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:29.890
Renata: For the scenario today, we've… like I mentioned, this is a prototype, so it's pre-filled all of the information you'd normally be typing in when you're filling out a form like this.

63
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:40.149
Renata: But please go through the next few questions and just think aloud as much as possible. We want to hear your thoughts on the content and information here, and you can go ahead and click the continue button when you're ready.

64
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.390
P1: Okay.

65
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.260
P1: Keep, keep clicking continue?

66
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.900
Renata: Yeah, I'll let you know when we're gonna stop and ask questions, sorry.

67
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:27.289
Renata: Alright, so I want to stop you here. In your own words, tell me what this page means to you.

68
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:39.540
P1: based on the initial information that I put into the system, it's telling me that I am eligible for the CHAMP VA benefits.

69
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:49.019
Renata: Got it. Just to make sure I understood you correctly, if you're eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMP VA?

70
00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:57.140
P1: I'm actually uncertain because it was already… it was already selected, but, I think.

71
00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:02.279
P1: If the answer was changed, it could potentially give you additional information.

72
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.680
P1: If I go back to where it says…

73
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:15.630
P1: you know, are you… are you and your applicants eligible and enrolled in TRICARE? I guess if you hit yes, it could…

74
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:23.389
P1: You know, it may say you're not eligible, or it may require additional information, but because it said no,

75
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.459
P1: It made me personally believe that because you don't already have some sort of,

76
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.630
P1: healthcare, and you're not using TRICARE.

77
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:35.610
P1: And you meet the criteria based upon being a veteran.

78
00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:41.109
P1: That when you select continue, then you are made aware that you are eligible.

79
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:50.630
Renata: Got it, okay. And looking at the gray box there on the screen, what do the little check marks mean to you, those green checkmarks?

80
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:56.419
P1: That those are the requirements, for eligibility, being permanently and or totally disabled.

81
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.640
P1: And that you're not eligible for TRICARE.

82
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:06.629
Renata: Got it. Last question about this box. What is the system telling you about your eligibility?

83
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.400
P1: that I'm eligible.

84
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:17.510
Renata: Got it. And so, how confident are you in that understanding that you're eligible for CHAM VA?

85
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.330
P1: I'm pretty confident, I would say on that scale of 1 through 5, 5 at this point.

86
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.689
Renata: Okay, so you're feeling quite confident.

87
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:29.760
P1: Yes, yes.

88
00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:36.490
Renata: Got it. And, if you were really applying today, what would you do next if you saw this screen?

89
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:37.939
P1: Go to continue.

90
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.220
Renata: Okay,

91
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:49.299
Renata: And I have another 1 to 5 question for you, one being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to understand this screen?

92
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.150
P1: 5? That's pretty easy, I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory.

93
00:10:53.660 --> 00:11:12.849
Renata: Okay, got it. Go ahead and click the continue button at the bottom of the screen for me. At this point, we're going to switch gears and we're going to look through a second prototype that I mentioned earlier. So, again, this is a prototype where not everything works. We're really just interested in your feedback and understanding the information that's being presented, but go ahead and click on Prototype Pineapple.

94
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:23.579
Renata: So this is the introduction page to the form, which you've seen before, so go ahead and scroll down to that link that says start your form without signing in again.

95
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:43.739
Renata: So, this prototype, I'd like you to proceed the same way you did with Prototype Blueberry. So you can click on the blue alert box and move forward, and just think aloud as you're going through it, and I'll stop you on the page with, I'll stop you, basically.

96
00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:44.250
P1: Okay.

97
00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.260
Renata: When I have questions.

98
00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.229
Renata: Alright, so how do you feel about the way this application just checked your eligibility?

99
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:08.759
P1: I mean, I feel like I don't…

100
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:24.289
P1: I don't know what information it was making the decision on. I mean, the information that's in here is just sort of my basic, you know, name, date of birth, social security number, whereas the last page, you know, you kind of clicked on some additional boxes that…

101
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:33.210
P1: led you to believe it was part of the eligibility, so, when you kind of just saw, like, that quick little… the system refreshing over thinking.

102
00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:39.199
P1: At this point, I would be wondering, you know, why am I not eligible?

103
00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:41.320
P1: Or why may I not be eligible?

104
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:52.850
Renata: Okay. If you had to describe how it makes you feel, is it… is this little yellow box helpful, intrusive? Would you use some other word to describe it?

105
00:12:53.760 --> 00:13:01.900
P1: It's certainly not helpful, I would say. You know, it's confusing, because I think most veterans would be…

106
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.550
P1: Thinking, like, well, why do I not meet their criteria?

107
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:12.329
Renata: Gotcha. And, do you trust that this information is accurate, what it's telling you?

108
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:22.540
P1: whoa… thinking… thinking personally, then I would say, no, it's not accurate, but, you know, for…

109
00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.649
P1: The purposes of it being sort of a demo model.

110
00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:32.019
P1: I guess I would say no as well. I mean…

111
00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:39.159
P1: I'm thinking, personally, like, you know, well, what information is it basing the decision on? The only thing that I've inputted was…

112
00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:43.359
P1: Date of birth, again, like, your personal… your basic personal information, so…

113
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.599
Renata: Got it.

114
00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:45.720
P1: I would say no.

115
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.120
Renata: Okay.

116
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:49.589
Renata: So, if you believe that this

117
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:56.019
Renata: yellow alert was wrong, that you're not actually eligible for TRICARE, what would you do at this point?

118
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:04.699
P1: I would try to find some sort of, like, help desk number, or you said TRICARE, but this is referring to CHAMP VA benefits, right?

119
00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.540
Renata: Yes.

120
00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:08.940
P1: Okay, then I would try to find some sort of…

121
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:14.740
P1: contact number for Champ VA, or, you know, a…

122
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:20.610
P1: email address or something along those lines where I could reach out and basically communicate that I've

123
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.070
P1: pretended to apply. I believe I'm eligible, but…

124
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:29.069
P1: you know, it says that I may not be eligible, could I… how would I find out additional information?

125
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.050
Renata: Okay, got it.

126
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:48.969
Renata: So, sounds… I just want to repeat back what you said to make sure I understand. You would be looking for a phone number or an email, some way to contact Champ VA to let them know, like, hey, I think this… this information I saw when I was attempting to apply was… is incorrect, like, how do I proceed?

127
00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:49.990
P1: Sure, yeah, exactly.

128
00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:57.440
Renata: Got it. Does this feel like the system is helping you to understand your options, or the system is blocking you from applying?

129
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.090
P1: It's blocking me from applying.

130
00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:02.629
Renata: Okay, and why specifically do you feel like it's blocking you?

131
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:12.259
P1: It just doesn't allow me… it doesn't allow… it doesn't provide any additional information. I think if, you know, maybe…

132
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.330
P1: If it's staying based on the veteran's information, applicants may not be eligible for CHAMP VA benefits.

133
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:23.479
P1: I would personally want another link or pop-up

134
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:30.900
P1: That lists maybe some of the disqualifiers, because then that would help me maybe use some sort of process of elimination to…

135
00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.020
P1: Determine whether it's accurate or inaccurate.

136
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:44.460
Renata: Got it, okay. Go ahead, for me and click on the continue button. I'm gonna have you go a little further into this prototype, and I'll stop you when I have some more questions.

137
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.020
P1: Okay.

138
00:15:53.720 --> 00:16:02.240
Renata: So, we've come to this card again. I just want you to take a look at what's in there, and I have a question for you once you've reviewed the information.

139
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.539
P1: Okay, I reviewed it.

140
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:14.140
Renata: Alright. Would you take the same or a different action, when presented with this card as compared to the other prototype that you saw?

141
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:33.999
P1: Yes, if I'm not mistaken, the previous page, asked about TRICARE, and it says, are you or any applicants eligible or enrolled in TRICARE? It says yes, but when you continue here, it says the veteran applicant is not eligible for TRICARE, so…

142
00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.089
P1: That would stand out to me, because…

143
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:42.039
P1: In the previous page, I'm telling the system that I am eligible or enrolled.

144
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:47.539
P1: And then it's saying, basically, that, I may not be eligible As a veteran.

145
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.010
P1: because, you know, for TRICARE, but… It's…

146
00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:56.830
P1: the previous page, I selected that I, you know, that either had or was eligible, so…

147
00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:01.560
P1: I guess I would, still reach out to CHAMP VA.

148
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:07.409
P1: Being that that's what I'm applying for, and as a backup, maybe reach out to TRICARE and see if there's some sort of…

149
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:13.750
P1: You know, connection between the two that may disqualify you from using the benefits.

150
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:23.530
Renata: Got it, okay. So at this point, would you still proceed with the application, or would you, like, hard stop contact CHAMPVA, contact TRICARE?

151
00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.020
P1: I would probably s-

152
00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:35.159
P1: just hard stop, instead of wasting my time. It's telling me if you didn't meet the eligibility criterias, you can exit the application, and

153
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:40.369
P1: it's telling me up here that I may not be eligible, so I would just, you know, reach out to one of the

154
00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:45.570
P1: One of the two, you know, sources directly, as opposed to continuing.

155
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.860
Renata: Okay.

156
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:56.909
Renata: 1 to 5 scale again, with 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy. How difficult or easy was it to understand this second prototype that you just went through?

157
00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:01.259
P1: I would say 3.

158
00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:03.110
P1: Just because…

159
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:13.719
P1: again, I'm more fixed right now on the fact that a previous page, I selected that I either was eligible or currently had TRICARE, and now it's telling me that I'm not eligible for TRICARE, so…

160
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.170
P1: It's… it's confusing. I mean, it…

161
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:20.910
P1: I think I could kind of get… The idea as to,

162
00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:25.230
P1: The eligibility as a result of being permanently in or total disabled, but…

163
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:29.430
P1: you know, the confusion now lies on the TRICARE piece.

164
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:44.599
Renata: Got it. I do want to just ask a clarifying question. So when you see that red X there next to the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE, you think that that's contradicting the previous page where you said, yes, I'm eligible or enrolled in TRICARE, is that correct?

165
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.570
P1: That's correct.

166
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:59.949
Renata: Okay, I just wanted to make sure I understand, and that our notes are accurate, so thank you for clarifying. So comparing the two prototypes that you've just been through, which would you prefer to use if you were actually filling out this form?

167
00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.490
P1: Well, based on what I've seen thus far, the first one.

168
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.959
Renata: Okay, and why do you prefer the first one?

169
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:15.280
P1: Well, it led me to believe that I can continue the application, and

170
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:23.390
P1: It just seemed like it maybe provided a little more details on eligibility. You know, when I… when I… it asked me for information that led to…

171
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:27.190
P1: The eligibility decision, where this one kind of just…

172
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:35.509
P1: Doesn't allow you… other than your basic information, you know, your name, date of birth, and social, there was nothing else that I could have put to check on eligibility.

173
00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:43.810
Renata: Got it, okay. Thinking about everything that you just saw, was there too much, too little, or just the right amount of information?

174
00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.950
P1: I still think these… you know, I know this is a prototype, but…

175
00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.950
P1: Based on it looking very similar to current.

176
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:57.309
P1: You know, application and programs the V offers, I still think it's too much information.

177
00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:07.609
Renata: Okay, got it. How… just… just needs to be more succinct, or… or, like, what… what do we mean by too much information? I want to make sure I understand.

178
00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:14.310
P1: Just more streamlined, you know, I think it should be, like,

179
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:19.369
P1: You know, less is more in some of these applications, in my opinion, so if it just asks for, like.

180
00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:37.170
P1: you know, all these pop-ups, like, that talk about eligibility and requirements, and you know, the top, right, if you didn't meet all the criteria required for CHMBA benefits, you could exit the application. If you met all the requirements, you know, I think the applicants may still be eligible, you can continue. And then you have this box up here talking about eligibility.

181
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:47.859
P1: And then this sentence on Champ Benefit Eligibility Summary is just… it just seems like a lot, you know, it should just say, again, less is more in some of these, in my opinion, and if it said, like.

182
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:53.219
P1: You know, you're eligible or you're not eligible, and then if you're not eligible, you know, you can reach…

183
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.460
P1: this number, or if you are eligible, you know, continue with the application, just…

184
00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:03.940
P1: streamline and make a little less information and a little easier to flow. The flow should be a little easier, in my opinion.

185
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:13.249
Renata: Got it. Thank you for sharing. One last question about this. I'm thinking about everything you've just seen. If you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident doing so?

186
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:20.719
P1: Yeah, I think I could explain it, but I would just caveat that with, I would also let them know that

187
00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.739
P1: It can be, you know, can come across as confusing.

188
00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.469
P1: And, this particular program.

189
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:35.760
P1: Doesn't allow you to… Provide additional information to verify your eligibility, whereas the first one

190
00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:41.010
P1: Takes account for a little… maybe a little more information?

191
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.050
Renata: Got it. Go ahead and scroll down and click the continue button on the screen.

192
00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:57.559
Renata: So now that we've gone through the second prototype, I want to walk through some scenarios and messaging with you to get your feedback. So if you scroll down on this page.

193
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:02.480
Renata: You'll see a gray button labeled Warning Alerts. Go ahead and click on that.

194
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:12.789
Renata: So, on this page, I'm going to read aloud a scenario, and you'll review the message, and please state any questions you may have or feedback you want to provide about it.

195
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:26.620
Renata: Okay. So for Alert A, in this scenario, you've entered your information, and you see the following message. Please think aloud as you're reading this, and let me know what your thoughts are around what this alert means, and explain what actions you might take.

196
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.540
P1: Okay.

197
00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.740
P1: I would just… it's basically saying,

198
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:53.509
P1: based on what I input, it can't verify my eligibility, and that I may want to check the information that I entered, so I would just go back and make sure that, you know, I'm putting my… spelling my name correctly, make sure my date of birth's correct, make sure my social security number's correct, any of the information that

199
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:58.680
P1: I was required to enter, I would verify that it's… that I have actually entered the correct information to

200
00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:03.420
P1: You know, obviously, if I misspelled something or put the wrong number, it could…

201
00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.030
P1: it wouldn't identify me, so that's why I may be saying it's, you know, I'm not eligible.

202
00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:18.399
Renata: Got it. So after you went and confirmed that there weren't any typos, mistakes with the information, would you still want to apply for CHAMP VA benefits despite this warning?

203
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:30.399
P1: No, I think I would still resort to my initial response of not moving forward. I've verified that the information's correct. If it wasn't correct, then maybe I would move forward and see if it changed the eligibility, but being that I…

204
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.309
P1: verify the information I submitted was correct, and I would… I would still just reach out to them directly.

205
00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.199
Renata: Okay, got it. You can scroll down to Alert B now.

206
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:49.879
Renata: So, in this scenario, you've entered your information just as before, but now you see the following message. Take a look at it and let me know what this means to you and any actions you might take.

207
00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:50.810
P1: Okay.

208
00:23:55.190 --> 00:24:00.019
P1: It's basically saying, you know, at that very moment, I cannot confirm the eligibility.

209
00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:04.069
P1: I can come back later, or just continue,

210
00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:10.300
P1: I hate when I see these messages, because, you know, it just says, Try again later, like…

211
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:16.699
P1: I mean, everyone's time has different time and, you know, to do things throughout the day, but…

212
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:24.859
P1: I usually set aside time to do things like this, so if I'm having to do it later, then, you know, I have to, like, sort of adjust my schedule and…

213
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:30.519
P1: Come back, and it's just… sometimes it kind of deters me from wanting to even apply, but…

214
00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:37.710
P1: you know, it could be an issue with the system, or whatever the case may be. So, me personally, because I wouldn't want to come back, I would just…

215
00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:42.669
P1: trying to continue the application to see if it made any difference.

216
00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.870
Renata: Got it. So you'd still want to apply?

217
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:46.700
P1: Yeah.

218
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:50.300
Renata: Okay, any other actions you'd take before doing so?

219
00:24:53.430 --> 00:24:54.050
P1: No.

220
00:24:54.380 --> 00:25:07.579
Renata: Okay, got it. You can now scroll down to Alert C. So, in the third scenario, you see the following alert. Again, same thing, just think aloud and let me know what your impressions are about this alert message.

221
00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:16.089
P1: Yeah, it's the same, I take it's the same as the first one, Alert A. Basically, it just asks me to verify the information that I put in.

222
00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:25.769
P1: And, you know, because it's saying it cannot verify me because of the… potentially because of the information I entered, so I'm gonna go back and check, and if it is…

223
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:30.589
P1: Correct, then, you know, you have the option to continue, or…

224
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.059
P1: Me, personally, I would just reach out to,

225
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.300
P1: either Champ VA or TRICARE, depending upon

226
00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:45.049
P1: You know, which one led me to believe may have caused the inability to, apply.

227
00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:50.830
Renata: Got it. And for this scenario, would you feel more confident now before applying?

228
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:58.980
P1: Yes, only because, you know, I verified. It's saying that the information I entered may be incorrect, so…

229
00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:06.580
P1: Being that I verified it, then yeah, I would say I feel more confident that I would just, you know, not move on.

230
00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.569
Renata: Gotcha. You can go ahead and scroll down to Alert D.

231
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:19.550
Renata: So, in this scenario, your information was located, and you see this message. Go ahead and read it aloud, and then I have some questions for you.

232
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:30.050
P1: Alright, based on the Veterans Information, applicants may not be eligible for CHAMP VA benefits. We found the Veterans Information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility System, DEERS, for TRICARE benefits.

233
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:36.610
P1: If you aren't enrolled, you aren't eligible for CHAMP VA benefits if you're eligible for TRICARE.

234
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:42.820
Renata: So, what would you do upon seeing this message?

235
00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:50.689
P1: Well, if I was trying to determine which benefit I wanted to use, then I would,

236
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:57.650
P1: I would probably resort to TRICARE, because it's saying…

237
00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:01.489
P1: Based on the information in DEERS,

238
00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:07.630
P1: I have TRICARE eligibility, so I'm not able to apply for CHAMP VA.

239
00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:11.970
Renata: Got it. Is there any additional information that you would want to see here?

240
00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:17.180
P1: No, not particularly.

241
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:22.379
P1: I think it explains, you know, what the system found and the options that you have.

242
00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:23.650
Renata: Got it.

243
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.249
Renata: We have one last alert for you to look at. You can scroll down to Alert E.

244
00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:39.230
Renata: And this is, so, in this last scenario, you've entered your information and you see this alert. What would you do? And is there any more information that you would want to see here?

245
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:50.229
P1: I wouldn't want to see any more information, you know, obviously, if I was hoping to get… be eligible for Champ VA, this would be a good sign, and then I would just continue with the application.

246
00:27:51.160 --> 00:28:02.409
Renata: Got it. So across all of the alert messages that you've seen on this page, how confident do you feel that you'd know what to do on a 1 to 5 scale? 1 being not confident, 5 being very confident?

247
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:08.500
P1: I would say 4. I mean, you know, even for the ones that… that,

248
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.130
P1: are a result of ineligibility. It's…

249
00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:13.690
P1: It's not overly confusing as to

250
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:19.220
P1: what the issue may be. You know, you're either having to verify your information you entered is correct.

251
00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:26.809
P1: Or, you know, option D references that, based on what the DEER system reflects.

252
00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.999
P1: you know, it seems like you're eligible for TRICARE, so…

253
00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:34.839
P1: And then 4 is self… E is self-explanatory, so I would feel pretty confident on…

254
00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.119
P1: you know, what I would do next based on all of the alerts.

255
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:42.980
Renata: Got it. Were any of the alerts confusing or unclear?

256
00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:06.649
P1: No, I wouldn't say confusing. Personally, like I said, the ones that say check back later would be more frustrating, if that's an option, but I wouldn't say it's confusing.

257
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:08.319
Renata: Okay, got it.

258
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:23.960
Renata: You can go ahead and scroll down to the bottom of the page again. There should be… yeah, click on that. So, we have one last task for you, on several messages that happen at the end of our scenarios and those prototypes. If you scroll down to Summary Cards, go ahead and click on that button.

259
00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:43.909
Renata: So on this screen, you're going to see four summary cards. Those first two, Card Style A, are from the prototypes that you went through a little earlier. The third and fourth cards, if you scroll a little further down the page, card style B are alternative designs, and we'd like you to look at all four of these, before we talk about them.

260
00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:44.510
P1: Okay.

261
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:15.850
P1: Okay.

262
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:21.509
Renata: All right. So what do you think that each card on this screen is telling you?

263
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:32.930
P1: The top two are in reference to being eligible and not being eligible, pertaining to TRICARE, and that's Card Style B.

264
00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:38.409
P1: is both eligible and not eligible, as it applies to CHAMP VA.

265
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.480
Renata: Got it, okay.

266
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:47.370
Renata: Any questions or confusion there, though?

267
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.900
P1: Yeah. So, you know, again, just…

268
00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:58.659
P1: more from a visual standpoint, you know, the top two reference CHAMP VA in the, you know, in the top two sections.

269
00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:04.180
P1: And then down here, It only, you know, references

270
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:08.350
P1: It does… I'm sorry. Up here, it does not mention CHAMP VA at all.

271
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:12.339
P1: But the second card style, it does mention Champ VA.

272
00:31:12.650 --> 00:31:17.170
P1: For both, and then it also references TRICARE, so… I guess…

273
00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:25.220
P1: Seeing this one would, would, sort of… You know, back.

274
00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:31.200
P1: what's… what program I was actually applying for, sort of like…

275
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:33.880
P1: You know, because it references Champ VA.

276
00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:39.019
P1: And this one doesn't I feel like these are more informative.

277
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:41.410
P1: On whether you're eligible or not eligible.

278
00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:48.760
Renata: Got it, okay. So, which set of cards is easiest to understand at a glance?

279
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.080
P1: Cardstyle B.

280
00:31:51.420 --> 00:32:01.239
Renata: Okay. And, aside from the fact that it references Champ VA, is there anything else specifically that makes cardstyle be clearer to understand?

281
00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:08.780
P1: No, I think they're both… I mean, they look pretty much identical, other than the fact that it, you know, has the reference of,

282
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:13.340
P1: Champ VA. I mean, a little bit of difference as far as your response, your response.

283
00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:18.150
P1: Here, your response is not bold, but it references Champ VA, so I think…

284
00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:23.049
P1: They're pretty, they're pretty much the same, I would just prefer to, you know, to, again.

285
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:30.889
P1: Be able to, sort of acknowledge what system I'm actually, or what program I'm actually applying for.

286
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:32.280
Renata: Got it.

287
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:38.709
Renata: So, was there any part of any of the cards that felt really unclear or confusing?

288
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.290
P1: No, I wouldn't say unclear or confusing.

289
00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:48.470
P1: I think… I think probably the majority would… would know that they are…

290
00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:56.879
P1: are at the login page, and sort of, doing the eligibility check for CHAMPVA, just me personally seeing…

291
00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:06.030
P1: That it references CHAMPVA is… is more, you know, again, sort of, it verifies what I'm actually, what I'm actually applying for.

292
00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:14.599
Renata: Got it, okay. So at this point, we're done with the prototype, so you can stop sharing your screen. I'm gonna take a quick sip of coffee.

293
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.180
P1: Okay.

294
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:23.859
Renata: So, was there any other feedback you'd like to add about the prototypes and messages that you saw today?

295
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:28.229
P1: No, nothing that stands out.

296
00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:36.339
P1: I just… I mean, I think all the work that goes into Trying to continuously improve any…

297
00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:46.609
P1: of the process, or processes that, you know, the VA offers or service members use is certainly beneficial. I think it's come a long way since…

298
00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:51.210
P1: You know, first, you know, ever look into the system many years ago.

299
00:33:52.240 --> 00:34:04.569
Renata: Got it. I know you mentioned that of the prototypes that you saw, you preferred that first one you looked at, the blueberry. Do you have any additional preferences or feedback on the eligibility clarity that should be added to this online form?

300
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.120
P1: Nothing that stands out.

301
00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:09.890
Renata: Okay. Do you have any questions for me?

302
00:34:10.449 --> 00:34:11.459
P1: I do not.

303
00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:29.209
Renata: All right. I wanted to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners, and just to remind you, we'll remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and we'll only share videos with VA partners with the purposes of improving VA.gov and digital experiences.

304
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:30.900
P1: Yes, I'm fine with that.

305
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.950
Renata: Alright, is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?

306
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:37.340
P1: No. Any of it can be shared.

307
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:47.539
Renata: Got it. Well, John, we really appreciate you taking time out of your Friday to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback's super helpful as we continue to work on the site to make sure it really works for veterans, so thank you.

308
00:34:47.540 --> 00:35:00.020
Renata: Lastly, Perigian, the folks who scheduled this session, will be sending you a little thank you note with a blurb that you can pass along to other veterans you may know, just to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies like this one.

309
00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:04.209
Renata: But with that, thank you so much again, enjoy the rest of your day, have a really great weekend.

310
00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.709
Renata: Thank you. And take care.

311
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:07.369
P1: Yeah, you all as well. Thanks again.

312
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.460
Renata: Thanks so much.

313
00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:09.040
P1: Bye-bye.

314
00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:10.180
Renata: Bye.
