1
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:14.659
Renata: Okay, I have started the recording, and I'd just like to confirm, are you comfortable, if we decided… are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.460
P6: Yes.

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:24.830
Renata: Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our session today to share with our other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?

4
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.510
P6: Yes.

5
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.389
Renata: Alright, thank you. So before we look at those prototypes I mentioned, just wanted to start with some warm-up questions.

6
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:39.610
Renata: Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs or CHAMP VA program before?

7
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.250
P6: No.

8
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.679
Renata: All right. Have you ever heard of the CHAMP VA program before?

9
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.380
P6: Yes.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.050
Renata: All right, could you explain to me in your own words what you know about eligibility of that program?

11
00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:05.649
P6: To my knowledge, it's just the civilian side of, health insurance for those who have a veteran spouse. It's our option.

12
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.680
P6: That we can use, should we choose?

13
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.600
P6: Outside of being a veteran.

14
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.439
Renata: Got it. We're not testing knowledge or abilities, like I said before. So, have you ever heard of TRICARE before?

15
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.090
P6: Oh, yes.

16
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:32.709
Renata: All right, and do you, could you explain, in your own words, the difference between TRICARE and Chant VA?

17
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:48.400
P6: Yes, so I believe TRICARE is the insurance that you would use if you were still active duty in the military, Champ VA being the insurance that comes once you are separated or retired from the military.

18
00:01:48.780 --> 00:02:08.700
Renata: Alright, got it, thank you. So at this point, I'm gonna share a link in the Zoom chat for you of a prototype, and I'd like you to open that in your browser and share your screen in Zoom, and I can help with any… walking you through any of that, but just giving you a moment now to close any extra windows or notifications that you have on, and let me know when you're ready for that, that link.

19
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.820
P6: Okay… Alright, ready.

20
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.290
Renata: Alright, popping it in now…

21
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.629
P6: Alright, I've got it up, would you like me to share?

22
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.680
Renata: Yes, please.

23
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.930
P6: Okay.

24
00:02:46.630 --> 00:03:01.879
Renata: Perfect, and you'll see on the left-hand side of the screen, there's a thing that says Flows. You can X that, it'll just give you a little bit more… there you go. Alright, so the… for this first task, if you could please click the orange button that says Pineapple.

25
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.919
Renata: Can you hit the back button for me, please?

26
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.019
Renata: It might have accidentally hit the wrong one. Try clicking pineapple again.

27
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.340
Renata: Alright.

28
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:29.440
Renata: So on this first page, just take a minute to look over the content, and when you're ready, in your own words, tell me what this page means to you.

29
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:26.199
P6: Okay, looks… I mean, the page looks pretty familiar to what I know of, of these, these web pages for the VA. I mean, all very standard, even in the way that it…

30
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.829
P6: Has everything listed out.

31
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:47.489
P6: I mean, to me, this is just the application starting page, making sure it gives you a stopping point for if you've already applied to it. I'm assuming it would take you to a different page if you have. Checking eligibility, making sure you have everything you would need in order to complete it.

32
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.210
P6: Starting that application, what to expect after you apply.

33
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.880
P6: And then, you know, being able to sign in.

34
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:08.719
Renata: All right, got it. So you mentioned who… sort of what the application is for. In your own words, who is eligible to apply?

35
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:25.760
P6: It looks like who's eligible to apply is once you've retired, separated, or have a, a spouse who's deceased, you would be able to apply as… as a spouse to the veteran.

36
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.000
P6: Okay.

37
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.919
Renata: Do you see any reasons you might not be eligible to apply?

38
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.220
P6: You might not be eligible if you've already applied.

39
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:55.589
P6: If you're eligible for TRICARE, you can't apply to it. If you're… and I would… I would gather from that, if you're eligible for TRICARE, then you're not eligible for CHAMPA, because that means you're not actually out of the military.

40
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:02.649
Renata: Got it, okay. And if you weren't sure whether or not you qualify, where on this page would you look for more information?

41
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.849
P6: Checking your eligibility, step one, and clicking on that, link for the open tab.

42
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:24.070
Renata: Okay. I also want to draw your attention to right below that link that opens in a new tab where it says we'll also help you check your eligibility when you complete this form. What are your expectations, if any, when you read this sentence?

43
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.750
P6: Hmm…

44
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:44.309
P6: Well, it does kind of make it sound like the we would be a person who's helping check your eligibility, but I find that hard to believe, so I would assume that…

45
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:58.979
P6: I don't know, it would have some sort of, I don't know, maybe like an AI tool or some sort of mechanism to be checking that, because it does kind of leave you understood that it's a… it's a human being that helps check your eligibility.

46
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:07.509
Renata: Okay, got it. Is there anything here that makes you uncertain about applying, if you were on VA.gov today?

47
00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:08.450
Renata: For real?

48
00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.780
P6: Hmm…

49
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:22.800
P6: I mean, I would probably, when it gets to the point down here for the gathering your information part.

50
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:34.100
P6: I might be hesitant if I feel like I don't have those, necessary supporting documents, ready to go. I would be hesitant of applying today for that.

51
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.299
Renata: Okay, got it. So you may, like…

52
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:43.960
Renata: Collect this as research, and then, you know, go collect your documents to apply at a later point.

53
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:48.789
P6: That… personally, yes, that's how I would always navigate these pages, yep.

54
00:07:48.790 --> 00:08:01.890
Renata: Okay, got it, thank you. Is there anything on this page that makes you uncertain about applying? Or, I already asked that, I'm sorry, I'm trying to cut back on caffeine and it's showing.

55
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:11.190
Renata: So, it sounds like if you were on VA.gov for real today, you'd… you'd sort of stop at this point,

56
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:24.690
Renata: Before continuing. Okay. So next question for ya. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application you're about to begin based on this page's content?

57
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.470
P6: You said it was 1 to 10?

58
00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:33.859
Renata: 1 to 5.

59
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.890
P6: 1 to 5.

60
00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:38.899
P6: I would say that I feel like a…

61
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.070
P6: I'm gonna say… I'm gonna say a 3. 3 out of 5.

62
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.309
Renata: Alright, and why did you give it a… that rating?

63
00:08:48.680 --> 00:09:02.310
P6: So, I think that it's a very helpful page when it comes to what you need and eligibility, but not giving any more information about what… I'd say, like, what

64
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:18.579
P6: what goes into the insurance, or what to expect from, Champ VA on the other side of this, past the application part, what you are going to receive should you be eligible and actually receive CHAMP VA.

65
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:38.010
P6: And that would make it a much longer page than it says. But, if I were… if I were looking to this first before applying, I would personally want to make sure that I had all the information before moving forward with the application, just like I would in, in, you know, the…

66
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:42.549
P6: public sector, where I'm doing this with, like, public insurance,

67
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.260
P6: So, that's why I would do, like, a 3 out of 5. Got it.

68
00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:58.149
Renata: Thank you for sharing. So at this point, you can scroll down the page. There's a big blue box, and you can click anywhere in there. It should take you to the next page, or click on sign in.

69
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:06.120
Renata: Alright, so, at this point,

70
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:27.260
Renata: we've pre-filled a lot of the information that you'd expect to sort of key in with a normal application, but I'd like you to go through thinking aloud as though you were filling this out for real. So, just a couple of things. I'll stop you when we're ready to ask you some more questions, but yeah, just think aloud as you're going through it, anything that comes to mind.

71
00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:52.799
P6: The first thing that, like, just on this page alone, my eyes went directly to the Veterans DD214, and so I think it's very helpful that it says you won't need to upload the Veterans DD214, because that would be my first, like, oh shoot, I need to make sure I have that, and that's, like, that involves another person, so that involves me, you know, with my husband. So, I think that that's helpful there.

72
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.109
P6: We're drawn to that.

73
00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.670
P6: Okay. I'm okay to click continue.

74
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.769
Renata: Go ahead, yeah.

75
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:12.509
P6: okay.

76
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.900
P6: Pretty straightforward.

77
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.370
P6: Okay.

78
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:50.800
P6: Date of birth, social security number, yeah, okay. So, can't remember on that, that page prior when it says, you know, you need to make sure you have these things. I'm sure that social security number was listed on there, but that is, yeah, an important note where that would make me stop, like, oh shoot, let me make sure I have that.

79
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.280
Renata: Got it, okay.

80
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:55.960
P6: Ehh…

81
00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.829
Renata: Alright, so I want to stop you here.

82
00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.419
Renata: How do you feel about, the way this application just checked your eligibility?

83
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.359
P6: I think it's fine. I…

84
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:27.219
P6: I personally am well aware that the VA system would have my husband's, information all already in the system, so I feel confident that

85
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:40.460
P6: giving the information, listed here, that it would be able to check and stop, if he would be eligible or not, or myself would be eligible or not. So, I feel fine about it.

86
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:49.080
Renata: Okay. If you had to use a word to describe, the eligibility check, did it feel helpful, intrusive, something else?

87
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.379
P6: I mean, I… helpful's fine. Helpful's fine.

88
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:02.490
Renata: Okay. And do you trust that this information is accurate?

89
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.270
P6: Yeah.

90
00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.790
Renata: And what would you do after seeing this message?

91
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:25.160
P6: The first thing I'd probably do is scroll back up and make sure that I've filled out everything properly, if I was really certain that we were eligible for it. And then if everything looked properly on my end.

92
00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:37.160
P6: I'd probably talk to my husband and see if he could get in contact with somebody to figure out why… why it was that the box came up saying that we might not be eligible.

93
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.020
Renata: Got it, okay.

94
00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:58.899
Renata: So, if I'm hearing correctly, you'd want to make sure that there weren't any typos or anything in the… in what you've entered. Talk to your husband about it, maybe contact somebody at VA to make sure, like, you're not missing anything about your eligibility. Would you choose to continue with the application, or would you stop at this point?

95
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:10.220
P6: If I was dead certain, then I would continue with the application. If I had any sort of doubt, I would not continue with the application.

96
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:21.970
Renata: Okay, you kind of answered my next question, which was, if you think that this was wrong, that you actually believe that you are eligible, would… would you, would, like, what would you do at this point?

97
00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:24.260
P6: Yeah, I'd keep going. Okay.

98
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:33.270
Renata: Got it. Does it feel like the system is helping you understand your options, or the system is blocking you from applying at this point?

99
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.590
P6: That feels like it's helping me.

100
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:50.590
Renata: It's… it clearly shows with the exclamation mark in the triangle, and kind of the universal sign of, like, whoa, slow down, or, like, a warning, and not a, like, clear-cut, like, meh, you can't go forward.

101
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:58.309
Renata: Got it, okay. So for the purposes of today, you can go ahead and click continue in the application, and I'll tell you when we're gonna stop again.

102
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.360
P6: Okay…

103
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:25.389
Renata: Oh, you might need to click the continue button. Like I said, it's a prototype, so it may, like, accidentally keep you on the same page.

104
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.439
P6: Okay, I was gonna say, I'm like, wait a second, wasn't that what I just read?

105
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.360
Renata: Yeah.

106
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:36.319
P6: Okay, but that's good, so how do we define… I don't remember seeing that on the page before, but that's…

107
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:38.579
P6: a good drop-down. Okay.

108
00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.450
P6: Yep, yep, yep. Okay.

109
00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.070
P6: Okay…

110
00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:12.720
Renata: Alright, so I'm gonna stop you here, take a look at this page, and then in your own words, please tell me what this page means to you.

111
00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:43.269
P6: Yeah, so this, this page would be a summary, yep, okay, yeah, a summary of what you just, what you were just completing, so it's restating how you answered the questions.

112
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:59.550
P6: to show you back, why it's… why you don't meet all the eligibility requirements, and then stating, if you don't, if you got an X up here, then you can exit the application so you can't move forward.

113
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:04.640
P6: Yeah, and then if you were to receive…

114
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.620
P6: Check marks, green checkmarks, then you could continue on.

115
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:19.379
Renata: Okay, I want to make sure I understand you correctly. Based on your understanding of this little gray card, if you are eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMP VA?

116
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.240
P6: Based on my understanding, no.

117
00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:28.579
Renata: Okay, got it. And what is the system telling you right now about your eligibility?

118
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:38.389
P6: That because we marked that, the veteran has TRICARE, and that's… we got an X for that, that they would not be eligible for CHAMPA.

119
00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:44.499
Renata: Okay, and based on this, so, based on this information, do you think that you're eligible?

120
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.510
Renata: For cheap egg.

121
00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:54.990
P6: Me personally, or me the prototype in here? Me the prototype, thank you for asking. Yeah. Me the prototype, no.

122
00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.210
Renata: Okay.

123
00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.710
Renata: And how confident are you in that understanding?

124
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:03.450
P6: I think I'm pretty confident.

125
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:08.410
Renata: Okay, alright. And what would you do next if you were really applying today?

126
00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:20.280
P6: So, at this point, it's clear to me that, you know, we… If we're getting TRICARE,

127
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:30.560
P6: that we can't get CHAM VAs, so we shouldn't be moving forward, and so I shouldn't be continuing with the application. So, I would be exiting the application.

128
00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:37.639
Renata: Okay, got it. Would you do any stop and research or call anybody, or is this just a straight exit?

129
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:47.150
P6: Yeah, I probably would. I probably would do a little more research, talk to my spouse about it, if we were, yeah, if we were pretty certain that we should be receiving it.

130
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:56.200
Renata: Okay, got it. On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this screen?

131
00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.929
P6: Pretty easy. 5?

132
00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.640
P6: Okay, got it.

133
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:18.239
Renata: So you can go ahead and click on the continue button, it's gonna take you back to that original screen that we were looking at. So we're gonna switch gears and look at the other prototype I'd mentioned earlier, so go ahead and click on Prototype Blueberry, that blue button.

134
00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:26.289
Renata: So this is the intro page. We've already looked at this before. You can just scroll down to the blue box, it's most of the way down the page, and click on the sign in button.

135
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:27.600
P6: Okay.

136
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:53.150
Renata: Alright, so please go through the next few questions, and remember to think aloud as much as possible. It's pretty much the same information and content here, but I'll… again, I'll stop you when we have some questions to ask you, but you can go ahead and click the continue button whenever you're ready to proceed to the next page.

137
00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:03.739
P6: Noticing you must meet all the eligibility requirements.

138
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.570
P6: I'm the spouse…

139
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:28.389
P6: K…

140
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:51.990
P6: Okay, veteran status… Not 100%… Okay, so there's that one again…

141
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.719
P6: Now, can I ask a question?

142
00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.700
Renata: Yes, you may.

143
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:10.750
P6: So, with that first page, the answer being no, and with this second page, The answer being yes.

144
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:18.130
P6: how is that… is that correct? Is that supposed to be…

145
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:23.400
P6: Is that a mistake at the way that this was made, or is that done on purpose?

146
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:40.599
Renata: Yeah, I think that that is a glitch in our little prototype, so the screen that you're on right now, we're going to assume that that information is the correct information. The previous screen, we can go ahead and, we can disregard. Imagine we never even saw it. Okay, okay.

147
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:49.780
P6: So, okay, the veteran is permanently, totally disabled from a service-connected disability. Okay, so I'm gonna read that as 100%. Alright.

148
00:21:51.950 --> 00:22:01.770
P6: Is the veteran, or any applicants eligible or enrolled in TRICARE? No, they're not, okay? Yeah, that's what I would expect.

149
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:03.350
P6: Just room.

150
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:14.520
Renata: Alright, so go ahead and read this page, and when you're ready, I have some questions for ya.

151
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.330
P6: Okay.

152
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.620
P6: Veteran is permanently and totally disabled.

153
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:21.830
P6: Yep.

154
00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:35.649
P6: Yep, okay, 100%, if they were… it's not eligible for TRICARE. Okay, yep. If you do not meet, you can exit. If you met… okay, yep.

155
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:42.200
Renata: Alright, so would you take the same or a different action as compared to the other prototype, based on what you're seeing here?

156
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:48.980
P6: I would take a different action. I'm seeing this as, you've got a green light, and you can go ahead and continue.

157
00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.279
Renata: Okay, so you would proceed with the application at this point?

158
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:52.820
P6: Yep.

159
00:22:53.040 --> 00:23:01.969
Renata: Okay. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand the second prototype?

160
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.020
P6: Five.

161
00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:06.529
P6: Okay, anything in particular that made it easy?

162
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:18.720
P6: I just… I think that having the green, checks is important, because it gives that, like, added visual to, yep, this is how you answered it.

163
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:32.489
P6: And, you know, this would… this would mean that you would be eligible. So I think that that's an important add to it. So, I see green checks, I see my answers, and I see, like, yep, you're good to go.

164
00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:41.390
Renata: Okay, got it. So comparing the two prototypes that you went through, which one would you prefer to use if this was a real experience on VA.gov?

165
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:48.880
P6: Well, interesting. That's an interesting question. They both seemed extremely similar.

166
00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.120
Renata: Okay.

167
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:55.489
Renata: You do not have to have a preference if you don't have a strong preference, but…

168
00:23:55.490 --> 00:24:01.039
P6: I don't think I have a preference. I don't know if I notice too many differences.

169
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:08.890
Renata: Okay, got it. So, thinking about everything that you just saw, was there too much, too little, or about the right amount of information?

170
00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:11.769
P6: I'd say about the right information.

171
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:16.909
Renata: Okay, and if you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident doing so?

172
00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.880
P6: But up until this point, yes.

173
00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:27.960
Renata: Okay, got it, thank you. You can go ahead and click the continue button, it'll take you back to that first screen again.

174
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:42.069
Renata: So, at this point, now that we've gone through the second prototype, I want to walk through some scenarios and messaging to get your feedback. So if you scroll down this page a little bit, there's some more buttons. I'd like you to click the one labeled Warning Alerts.

175
00:24:43.780 --> 00:25:02.389
Renata: All right, so I'm going to read some scenarios out loud, and then you'll review the message, and please just respond with any questions or feedback that pops up for you. So, for this first alert, in this scenario, you've entered the veteran's information, and you see the following message.

176
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:09.919
Renata: What thoughts do you have around this alert? And, please let me know what actions you may take if you saw this in this scenario.

177
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:18.400
P6: I think the alert is helpful.

178
00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:34.809
P6: I would be worried and concerned if I came into this confident that my veteran was in the system, and I got an alert that said we couldn't find the veteran's information in our system.

179
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:53.519
P6: I would be checking, like it suggests, I would be checking to make sure that the information I entered was correct, but then I would also probably be looking at who I could contact, if I were certain that they were in there, I'd be looking at how to contact somebody.

180
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:58.620
Renata: Got it, okay, thank you. You can go ahead and scroll down,

181
00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:04.330
Renata: Actually, sorry, I have more ques… I need to have more caffeine today.

182
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:10.999
Renata: In this scenario, with that Alert A, would you still want to apply for CHAMP VA benefits despite this warning?

183
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:21.860
P6: I personally would not… I would want to, but I would not move forward without… with this kind of a warning.

184
00:26:22.090 --> 00:26:31.710
Renata: Okay, got it. So you would first… the actions you would take would be to, again, check that the veteran's information is correct, and then maybe look to call someone. Is there anything else that you would do at this point?

185
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:48.419
Renata: All right, now you can go to Alert B. So sorry about that. So, in this scenario, you've entered the veteran's information just as before, but now you're seeing this message. Would you want to apply for CHAMP VA benefits despite the warning here?

186
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.820
P6: Yes. Yes, I would.

187
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.230
Renata: Okay, why is that?

188
00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:21.149
P6: Because it sounds like it's more or less a VA problem than my own problem, and so if… if my goal was to apply for those benefits, and this was the alert that I got, I would continue moving forward and think that, okay, well, I'll try and get as far as I can in the process, and just save for later.

189
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.020
Renata: Okay.

190
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:27.979
Renata: So, are there any actions that you take before continuing with your application for CHAMP VA benefits?

191
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.550
Renata: Okay.

192
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:47.319
Renata: Thank you. You can go ahead and scroll to Alert C. So, in this third scenario, same as before you've entered the veteran's information, and you see the following alert. In this scenario, would you feel more confident now before applying?

193
00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:14.739
P6: it still, to me, sounds like this is a… a system problem, like a VA side problem.

194
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:22.540
P6: So, I feel the same amount of confidence with this alert as I did to Alert B. It would be a, like…

195
00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.540
P6: Huh.

196
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:33.040
P6: VA side, some system issue is happening and it can't confirm the eligibility, but I'm gonna go ahead and continue and get as far as I can.

197
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:38.460
Renata: Okay, got it. And same actions as with B, like, no additional steps, you're just gonna keep going?

198
00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:53.780
Renata: Okay, thank you. You can scroll to Alert D now. So, in this scenario, again, you've entered the information, and it was located this time. So, you see this message, what would you do? Is there any additional information that you would want to see here?

199
00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:05.169
P6: I think that this is good information, I think the explanation that

200
00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:13.140
P6: we found you in the system, for TRICARE, therefore you can't, enroll into CHAMP VA.

201
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:18.489
P6: So I think that that's necessary. I…

202
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.279
P6: I mean, I feel like this would be fine to not…

203
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:30.330
P6: have me move forward. I might…

204
00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:37.850
P6: ask if I was certain that I was able to. I might ask around, or ask somebody, or talk to my spouse about it.

205
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:46.470
P6: But it does seem very clear to me that I wouldn't be eligible based on the information that was found in the system.

206
00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:51.020
Renata: Okay, and what would you do if you saw this alert? Any actions that you would take?

207
00:29:51.940 --> 00:30:11.470
P6: I would probably… well, if… it would only be, like, a… if I was certain that I'm eligible, that I believed I was eligible for Champ VA, that I would then pursue, speaking to somebody about that. If I was just coming into the system willy-nilly, and without any, like.

208
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:24.270
P6: prior knowledge into any of it, then, you know, I probably wouldn't take any additional steps to move forward. This would be a clear enough sign to be like, nope, okay, I'm not eligible.

209
00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:29.690
Renata: Got it. Thank you for that. You can scroll down, we have one last…

210
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:41.349
Renata: Alert for you to look at. So, same scenario, you've entered the veteran's information and you see this alert, it says success. What would you do at this point? Any additional information that you want to see?

211
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.310
P6: Nope, this would be enough for me to move forward with applying.

212
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:54.260
Renata: Okay, alright. So, across all of the alert messages that you just saw, how confident do you feel that you know what to do on a 1 to 5 scale?

213
00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:55.960
P6: Eth.

214
00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.600
Renata: A 5? Okay.

215
00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:02.620
Renata: And were any of the alerts confusing or unclear?

216
00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:18.839
P6: I think that the alerts that have that first sentence that says we can't confirm the eligibility of the applicants right now.

217
00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:37.680
P6: The way that that sounds is that it's a VA system problem and not a U problem. So, I do think that that can be a little misleading, because it makes it sound like, oh, well, maybe the system's not working right now, so we can't confirm it on our end, but it still might be true.

218
00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.420
P6: Versus a, we can't find you in the system.

219
00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:47.439
P6: At the moment, kind of a thing. That's how it feels.

220
00:31:47.570 --> 00:32:01.239
Renata: So, if we could wave a magic wand, you'd want it to be a little bit clearer if it's, like, the veteran can't be found versus the VA system is having an issue, and it's just not working at the… okay, got it. Thank you.

221
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:05.850
Renata: Any other feedback on these messages before we move forward?

222
00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:06.919
P6: I don't think so.

223
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:11.210
Renata: Alright, you can go ahead and click on the, Continue or Return to Main Screen button.

224
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:19.790
Renata: So, last task, I'd like some feedback on some different messages that happened at the end of our scenarios today, so go ahead and click on the summary cards button for me.

225
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:38.590
Renata: So on this screen, you'll find four summary cards. The first two, card style A, are from the prototypes that we already went through today. And the third and fourth cards, if you scroll down, card style B, are alternative designs. Please take a look, a moment to look at all four of these cards before we talk about them.

226
00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.570
P6: Okay.

227
00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.820
P6: okay.

228
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:20.160
P6: Okay. I'm ready.

229
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:23.869
Renata: Alright, what do you think that each card is telling you?

230
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:38.039
P6: Each card is giving a summary to your responses, and a visual for whether or not, because of your response, you are eligible for Champier.

231
00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:39.800
Renata: Okay.

232
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:53.200
Renata: I want to draw your attention, on the card that there's a slight difference on these. I know I'm… we're not trying to do magic eye here. Spot the difference games.

233
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.040
P6: I caught the difference!

234
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.929
Renata: Yeah, okay, I'm curious,

235
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:04.420
Renata: what do you think is the difference in, like, what they're telling you? If anything, really?

236
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:15.040
P6: So I think that the card style B was more straightforward in that your responses did not

237
00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:21.800
P6: meet all of the requirements, so I can tell that that… those sentences right there, that your responses met.

238
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:37.059
P6: or did not meet was the difference between the two. And, I do think that card style B is more straightforward and more helpful seeing it, up against cardstyle A.

239
00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:54.599
Renata: Got it. So, just want to make sure I'm confirming. Card style B for you is easier to understand at a glance, or… or do you prefer cardstyle… okay, cardstyle B. Got it, thank you. Was there any part of the cards on this screen that feels unclear or confusing?

240
00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:10.540
P6: I think the only thing that I'm drawn to is,

241
00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:17.369
P6: the last sentence on each of these, when it says, the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE.

242
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.519
P6: Or is eligible for TRICARE.

243
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:27.320
P6: I… It can just feel, like…

244
00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:36.949
P6: I guess, harder to understand what the checkmark and the X is in relation to that.

245
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.290
P6: Because it's not…

246
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:55.369
P6: exactly what the person would have recorded as their response. It's like, it's the summary of it, right? So, and I don't know if I'm, like, getting that across correctly, but,

247
00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:15.110
P6: you're saying yes or no up here, and this feels like, when you say, like, the veteran is permanently, totally disabled, this feels like very typical, straightforward VA verbiage up here, that we're used to seeing, but the veteran or applicant is not eligible for TRICARE,

248
00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:19.699
P6: or is eligible for TRICARE, it almost seems like,

249
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:30.569
P6: like, it's paradoxical. So, like, you have the veteran or applicant is eligible, but you have a red X, or the veteran or applicant is not eligible, and you have a green, checkmark.

250
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:55.539
P6: So you have to really understand what the summary is telling you, that, like, you really need to read, based on the information, what's… what you recorded below may be eligible, yes, green, yes, green, may not be eligible, yes, green, no red. You kind of have to understand that and not read too much into that last, sentence. I feel like that could slip you up a little bit.

251
00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.060
P6: bit.

252
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:58.770
P6: Even though it was your response.

253
00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:08.340
Renata: I think, yeah, thank you for that feedback, I appreciate it. Is there anything, if you could wave a magic wand, that would make this clearer so that that wouldn't trip you up?

254
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.809
P6: I like…

255
00:37:24.430 --> 00:37:48.859
P6: so I like that your responses didn't meet. I would… I would probably, if there was bolding around the met and didn't meet, but I also like that it says your responses in there, too, so it's almost like if it was a hybrid of all of them, so that it's saying that, your responses met all of it, yay, and you said this, and you said this.

256
00:37:48.860 --> 00:38:02.489
P6: Therefore, you get a green check, a green check. Your responses didn't meet, but you said this, and you also said this. So, yeah, so almost like a hybrid of the two maybe would make that a little bit clearer.

257
00:38:02.490 --> 00:38:11.680
Renata: Gotcha. So, like, if where it says your responses met, all of that was in that little header bit, and then we still had responses below, or something. Okay.

258
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:12.980
P6: Yeah, yeah.

259
00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:21.280
Renata: Okay, great. Thank you for that feedback, that's really helpful. At this point, we're done with the screen sharing portion, so you can end your screen share.

260
00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:26.550
P6: Cammon.

261
00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.840
P6: Well… I'm trying.

262
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:43.140
Renata: If it's being difficult, we are almost at the end of the session, so you can leave it up too, that's totally fine.

263
00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.139
P6: Here, let me see, maybe if I bring it up this way. Stop share, did that work?

264
00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:51.579
P6: No, now it's having me share again. Can you still see? Oh, you can't.

265
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.220
Renata: I can still see.

266
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:59.610
P6: Okay, it is being difficult, and not doing anything when I click stop share.

267
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:12.670
Renata: Love that for us, thank you, Zoom! That's totally fine, we'll just leave the screen share up for now, we're almost finished. Is there any other feedback you'd like to add about the prototypes and messages that you saw today?

268
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.630
P6: Bill?

269
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:25.710
Renata: Alright, and do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

270
00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.440
P6: Hmm…

271
00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:38.789
P6: I don't think so. I tend to, lean towards…

272
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:48.390
P6: lists, so I like when things are listed out, just like, you know, that has the bullets. That's how I prefer to see it.

273
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.220
Renata: Okay, got it.

274
00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:58.370
Renata: I'm just gonna check to see if our observers have any questions. I'm not seeing any, but do you have any questions for me at this point?

275
00:39:59.000 --> 00:39:59.660
P6: No.

276
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:17.239
Renata: All right, I want to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners. And just to remind you, we remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and we only share videos with VA partners for the purposes of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.

277
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:22.309
Renata: Okay. Alright. Is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?

278
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.550
P6: Nope.

279
00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:36.620
Renata: Okay, well, we really appreciate you taking time out of your day and your week to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback's super helpful as we continue to work on the site to make sure it works for veterans and their family members, so thank you.

280
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:44.759
Renata: Lastly, the folks who set up this call, Paragian, will be sending you a thank-you note with a little blurb, and you can pass that along to other veterans or,

281
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:55.300
Renata: family members of veterans you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in future research studies, but with that, thank you so much again. I hope you feel better soon, and enjoy the rest of your day and your week.

282
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:56.470
P6: Thank you!

283
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.179
Renata: Alright, take care.

284
00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:58.940
P6: Bye-bye.

285
00:40:58.940 --> 00:40:59.590
Renata: Bye.
