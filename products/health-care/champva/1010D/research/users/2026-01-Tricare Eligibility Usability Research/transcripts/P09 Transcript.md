1
00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:10.450
Renata: All right, I have started the recording, and I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

2
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.260
P9: Yes, ma'am.

3
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:20.919
Renata: Alright, and are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that could be used to identify you?

4
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.659
P9: Yes, ma'am.

5
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:34.569
Renata: Thank you. All right, so before we look at those prototypes I mentioned, we just have a few warm-up questions. Have you ever applied for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs or CHAMP VA program?

6
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.270
P9: Yeah, ma'am.

7
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.800
Renata: All right. Have you ever heard of the CHAMP VA program before?

8
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.110
P9: I have, yes ma'am.

9
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.169
Renata: Got it. Could you explain to me, in your own words, what you know about eligibility of that program?

10
00:00:50.570 --> 00:01:07.040
P9: Man, that's a great question. I know I looked at… so I retired in 2019, so I had, you know, TRICARE benefits, but I know… but I'm also, 100%, service disabled, so it was certainly something I looked at.

11
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:17.130
P9: But I think when we were just kind of weighing a lot of options, I think I was eligible, but I can't remember, but it just seemed because of where I was with

12
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.350
P9: TRICARE, it just seemed like a better option. That all said.

13
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.889
P9: Yeah, I'd be… I'm not that crystal clear on the requirements.

14
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.329
Renata: Got it. That's totally fine, thank you. So you mentioned TRICARE. Do you know what the difference between TRICARE and Champ VA is at all?

15
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.490
P9: Well, I know TRICARE, you know, you go to civilian doctors and, the VAs through, VA facilities.

16
00:01:43.490 --> 00:02:06.379
P9: And I… I'm usually better prepared. I should have looked up Champ VA before this meeting, but, anyway, yeah. Yeah, I know that because of the VA, because I, again, doing the service disabled, I know that's why I inquired and checked it out. But, I'm on TRICARE Select, because I'm kind of in the country here, so it's kind of out of… I pay a little bit of out-of-pocket, but…

17
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.230
P9: It's not that bad.

18
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.199
Renata: Okay, got it. And we do not expect anybody to do research before they come to these sessions.

19
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.259
P9: I'm into lobster, that's very bad on me.

20
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:33.160
Renata: So, at this point, I'm gonna share a link in the Zoom chat of one of the prototypes. Once I share that, I'd like you to open your browser and share your screen in Zoom. I just wanted to confirm before I drop that link in, are you on a mobile, tablet, desktop device?

21
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.750
P9: a laptop.

22
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.099
Renata: Got it, okay.

23
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.379
Renata: Let me find the right…

24
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.510
P9: Connected to a monitor, so if I ever look up, I'm just looking at my…

25
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.510
P9: My big monitor here.

26
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:53.949
Renata: Totally fair. So I've dropped the link in the chat, go ahead and open that in your browser, and once it's loaded, if you could please share your screen, and I can help you with that if you have any issues. Absolutely.

27
00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.590
P9: It says… oh, I'm sorry, it's not… oh, there we go.

28
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.100
P9: Did I do that right?

29
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.939
Renata: Don't see anything yet. You might need to click… there's, like, a smaller share button once you select which window or screen you wanna…

30
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.400
Renata: broadcast.

31
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.909
P9: Alright, let me put you up here. Apologies here.

32
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.490
Renata: worries.

33
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.700
P9: No, I just see the… prototype blueberry and pineapple, but I don't see…

34
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.670
Renata: And then I just see your screen.

35
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.119
P9: Okay, if you click back into the Zoom application, oh, yep, let me do that.

36
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:48.300
Renata: Within the Zoom, there's a bunch of icons at the bottom of the screen, like audio, video, etc. Sort of towards the right-hand side of the screen, there should be an icon that's, like, a box with an up arrow that says share. Do you see that?

37
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.069
P9: Sorry, I'm a Microsoft Teams guy.

38
00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.250
Renata: I… look, every time I use Zoom, they've moved something around, and I don't know where it is anymore, and it's… it's a nightmare, so…

39
00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.880
P9: You know what I'm talking about, alright.

40
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.510
Renata: Yeah.

41
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.190
P9: Apologies here. I work in cyber, so I'm having to jump through these.

42
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.840
Renata: Oop, it looks like you might be frozen.

43
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.789
Renata: Will, are you still able to hear me?

44
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:10.770
Renata: Well, if you're able to hear me, sometimes Zoom causes some issues. You may need to leave the Zoom and come back in. Oh, I see you in the waiting room. You're already ahead of me.

45
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:27.609
Renata: You're muted again. I'm so sorry about that. That's fine, I was just saying, it looks like you're in the room twice now, I was just saying to you, I was like, if you can hear me, you might need to leave and come back.

46
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.950
P9: Oh, apologies, yeah, I didn't even see that.

47
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.230
Renata: No, no worries. Were you able to get screen sharing to work?

48
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:35.160
Renata: It can be…

49
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:47.490
P9: Let me get that started, and if you want to send me the… oh, I don't see… oh, there it is. That link again, I'll get that started. Okay, perfect. So there's my big screen.

50
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.500
P9: And if you want to send me the, link…

51
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.739
Renata: Yeah, I can do that.

52
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.910
P9: And I apologize, I'm looking in…

53
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.710
Renata: Oh, no, you're totally fine.

54
00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:00.699
P9: Hide… Chat, there it is, sorry. I got it.

55
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:08.289
P9: Allow… Revisit… there we go. Let me move this up.

56
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.420
P9: This is probably what you're looking…

57
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.670
Renata: That is… Yes.

58
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.860
P9: Alright, sorry about that. Not the sharp drawer.

59
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:33.379
Renata: No worries. So on… if you could go ahead and click the blue button that says Prototype Blueberry for me. Alright, so on this page, just take a minute or so to look over the instructions, and when you're ready, in your own words, tell me what this page means to you.

60
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:46.610
P9: Yeah, this is… I mean, this looks familiar, this is kind of what I remember, like, I'm, you know, having…

61
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:53.820
P9: I have 3 kids and everything, you're always trying to look for the best, you know, health, options.

62
00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.920
P9: you know, checking out the eligibility, and I…

63
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:07.779
P9: TRICARE, you can't get CHAMP VA benefits. I didn't know that, honestly.

64
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.069
P9: Well, like most things, it's a VA, it's… That's a lot of stuff.

65
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:46.600
P9: I do remember… I'm gonna… because I'm recording, the one thing about getting an account and signing an account, it seemed the VA, when they use, I think it's the DS logon, it gets very confusing across a lot of other websites, and it was,

66
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:58.459
P9: I know I brought… and again, I'm in cyber, like, this… I'm used to this stuff, and GUI is a big thing for me, so the GUI is very, you know, that user interface is just…

67
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.980
P9: the front end. But anyway.

68
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.969
P9: Yeah, I think that's kind of what I've…

69
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:12.920
P9: I mean, again, very well done. It has the links to what… exactly what I would want, especially having the,

70
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.490
P9: Eligibility right up front.

71
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:21.859
Renata: Got it. So, I have a few questions for you about this page. In your own words, what is this application for?

72
00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:33.110
P9: For, to… benefits, I'm sorry, health… medical benefits for, dependents, spouses, and children.

73
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:38.600
Renata: Got it. And if you weren't sure whether you qualified, where on this page would you look?

74
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.050
P9: Number one there, you know, check your eligibility.

75
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:55.670
Renata: Okay, and I want to draw your attention to underneath the link that's in Step 1. There's a line that says, we'll also help you check your eligibility when you complete this form. What are your expectations, if any, when you read this sentence?

76
00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:09.400
P9: That's interesting. I mean, is that…

77
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:19.060
P9: Is that using… when you say we will also, you know, I'm just thinking from, hey, I'm… you know, Joe Schmuckatelli here, looking at it,

78
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:29.799
P9: I don't know, I mean, is it… are they using AI? Are you using some sort of… like, if I'm just checking the eligibility, I'm sure there's checkboxes actually in the form, and if I don't hit those, then…

79
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:35.020
P9: I would think I would determine and not waste my time, but…

80
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:52.670
P9: I don't know, I find that interesting. I guess if you're questionable, or questioning if you are eligible, then that gives you some reassurance to, you know, as a backup, if you're 50-50 on the fence. That lets you know that, hey, somebody else is gonna at least,

81
00:10:52.760 --> 00:11:00.430
P9: back that up for you. So… Okay. You know, talk… I kind of… sorry, I kind of talked through things, and yeah, I can see the benefit of that.

82
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:05.599
Renata: Okay, is there anything here that would make you uncertain about applying?

83
00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:23.169
P9: You know, for me personally, or, you know, for me, you know, yeah, being eligible for TRICARE because, you know, as a retiree, you know, 20 years, you're eligible for that TRICARE, so when I see that, you know, you can't get CHAMP VA benefits, then, yeah.

84
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.679
Renata: Okay, so if you were on VA.gov for real today, if you saw that, you'd go, okay, I'm not applying.

85
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:36.470
P9: I'm not applying, right. And that's a funny thing, I just don't even remember… I don't remember applying for CHAMP VA, but I don't even remember that.

86
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:39.889
P9: Seeing that, that would have been probably saved me a lot of time.

87
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:58.290
Renata: I just lost my place in my questions. No, you're totally fine. So would you want any more information before, like, stopping the application process? What would you do at this point, once you've read that line about TRICARE?

88
00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.719
P9: I'd probably want a, well…

89
00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.539
P9: You know, a phone number if…

90
00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:13.090
P9: you know, I wasn't gonna be on hold for, you know, 30 minutes. You know, if I was gonna get ahold of somebody, like, hey, quick question.

91
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:31.970
P9: am I eligible here? You know, if you're just trying to find that eligibility up front, like, I get it, we'll check it at the end, but I'm more of a front, like, don't waste my time, you know, can you tell me? This is my situation. I have a dependent father-in-law, you know, along those lines, you know, there's just so many scenarios I've seen.

92
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.070
P9: That, I would definitely have the questions.

93
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:45.079
Renata: Got it, okay. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poorly and 5 being very well, how informed do you feel about the application based on this page's content?

94
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:49.619
P9: This page, I mean, I'd put it at a… really at a…

95
00:12:50.890 --> 00:13:05.469
P9: Again, only because I don't see a phone number, and I… there might not even be a phone number, or might not even be useful, you know, I'd give this… this is very well done. I love the amp… where you amplify,

96
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:22.250
P9: certain keywords, like when you list yourself, and then you bold AND, that's, that's huge, you know, AND, ORs are huge. So, sometimes when people are scanning, they're gonna, you know, skip over that, so I think emphasizing those words are huge.

97
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:28.389
P9: Using the lists, you know, talking about health insurance card, Medicare, when you put it in that kind of… that's…

98
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:37.969
P9: military guys, we love lists. You know, break it down in, that kind of… that kind of, military guys and gals, not,

99
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:49.759
P9: Scooting there, but… and links. Links are huge, you know, redirecting me to, right to that, information, so I'm not having to Google it on the side. So…

100
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.639
P9: 4.8. I feel like I'm doing a piece of review.

101
00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:59.449
Renata: If I… if I had to force you to choose a whole number, would it be more of a 4, or more of a.

102
00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.249
P9: You're gonna do that. Come on, let me split hairs.

103
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:10.689
P9: I mean, this is pretty online. I'd put this at a 5. Okay. Because it's, you know, rounding up.

104
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:20.799
Renata: Got it, got it. Okay. So at this point, you can scroll down, and there's a blue box where it says sign in with a verified account. Go ahead and just click on anywhere in that box.

105
00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:41.409
Renata: All right. So we're gonna imagine that you saw the intro page, and you decided to continue applying anyways today. I know that you mentioned that you wouldn't continue because of the TRICARE information, but just for the sake of today's scenario, we're gonna imagine you were like, good, we're going. Yep. At this point, I'd like you to just…

106
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:58.210
Renata: start reading and filling through. Because it's a prototype, we've pre-filled some of the information you'd normally be typing in yourself. But just think out loud as you go along, and I'll stop you when I have questions, but whenever you're ready, you can click continue and sort of start filling out the form.

107
00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.000
P9: Awesome. Sounds good.

108
00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.149
P9: Sorry, clicked that.

109
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:12.360
P9: Okay.

110
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:47.790
Renata: Alright, so I'm gonna stop you here. Go ahead and just take a look at the content on this screen, and then I have some questions for you.

111
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:48.790
P9: Okay.

112
00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.029
Renata: Alright, so, in your own words, tell me what this page means.

113
00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:06.689
P9: It means I'm, based on my input, that I would be eligible for CHAMP VA.

114
00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:09.289
P9: Okay. Myself and my dependents.

115
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:22.810
Renata: Got it. And I know that you already saw this on the intro page, but just based on the content on this screen, if you are eligible for TRICARE, can you still get CHAMPA, just based on what you're seeing on this screen? No. Okay.

116
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:30.000
Renata: Alright, and I want to draw your attention to the little icons or check marks inside that gray box. What do those mean to you?

117
00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.589
P9: you know, you're good to go. Green check is good, red X, no good.

118
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:40.109
Renata: Okay. And what is the system telling you about your eligibility?

119
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:46.130
P9: that I'm eligible. You know, if I see green checks down the side, it says, you know,

120
00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:54.879
P9: the applicant may be eligible. I should point that out, kind of overlook that, but based on my responses.

121
00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:01.010
P9: I'd say if you've met all the eligibility, or you think, yeah, select and continue, yeah.

122
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:06.040
Renata: Okay. And how confident are you in that understanding about your eligibility?

123
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.360
P9: I'd be pretty on… I mean…

124
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:16.089
P9: again, I'm a simple guy, but if I'm seeing green checks, based on my input, I'm pretty confident.

125
00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:21.429
Renata: Okay, so what would you do next if you were really applying today and you saw this screen?

126
00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.609
P9: I'd continue.

127
00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:31.319
Renata: Alright, and on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being very hard and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand this screen?

128
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.039
P9: Oh, this is very easy. 5.

129
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.889
Renata: Okay, go ahead and click the continue button at the bottom of the screen for me.

130
00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:47.599
Renata: So, now we're gonna, switch gears and go through the second prototype I'd mentioned earlier. Again, not everything's gonna work, but yeah, go ahead and click on Prototype Pineapple.

131
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:56.600
Renata: So, this is the introduction page to the form, which you've already seen before, so you can go ahead and scroll down to that blue box again and click Start Your Form, or sign in.

132
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.420
P9: Yes, ma'am.

133
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:10.130
Renata: So, for this prototype, I'd like you to proceed the same way you did, with the last one. I'll let you know when I want to stop and ask you some questions, but just think aloud as you're going through this.

134
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:10.730
P9: We'll do.

135
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.999
Renata: Click continue whenever you're ready.

136
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.880
P9: Alright.

137
00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.099
P9: I like that you mentioned I don't have to…

138
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.370
P9: find my DD214. It's always nice.

139
00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:33.790
P9: whenever we think, like, VA, and they ask for the 214, like, I've submitted to you guys 3,000 times, how do you not have a copy of my 214? Sorry, you said think aloud, but…

140
00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.840
Renata: No.

141
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:36.790
Renata: Fair, it's fair.

142
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:56.319
Renata: Alright, so I'm gonna stop you here. Take a look at that alert that just popped up at the bottom of the screen, and once you're done reviewing it, let me know, I have some questions for you.

143
00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.150
P9: Okay.

144
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:03.850
P9: Yes, ma'am.

145
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.969
Renata: Alright. How do you feel about the way this application just checked your eligibility?

146
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:22.249
P9: Well, it's good. I mean, it automatically checked it through the deer system, and I'm a former yeoman, you know, kind of a guy, so I know that deer system well from many years ago. It's nice.

147
00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:28.009
P9: that it, automatically, you know, verified through, you know, I can tell…

148
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:34.339
P9: Every vet's gonna understand the deer system. So, while it might be frustrating that,

149
00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:49.950
P9: you know, you're… you're trying to apply for CHAM VA, or say you don't think you're eligible for TRICARE, then you know you got a lot of work to do, but in any case, the fact that it verified through DEERS, I…

150
00:19:50.100 --> 00:20:01.879
P9: I think that just saved me a lot of time and work. One, it answered the question of maybe I don't know if I'm eligible for DEERS, so now it, that would notify me and, you know.

151
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:09.889
P9: go, go online and make an appointment for the, ID office, and, and they can,

152
00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.330
P9: Verify and adjust your deers.

153
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.350
Renata: Got it.

154
00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:25.409
Renata: If you had to use a word to describe how, this eligibility check made you feel, was it helpful, intrusive, some other word?

155
00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:43.509
P9: No, very helpful. Again, just kind of saved me the time. Again, if I wasn't certain of my TRICARE eligibility, or, you know, or CHAMP VA eligibility, kind of like what I was going through a few years back, this helps me understand that.

156
00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.140
Renata: Okay. And do you trust that this information is accurate?

157
00:20:47.320 --> 00:21:04.210
P9: Well, you know, yeah, I do. There are always going to be exceptions, of course, and that's why I kind of brought up the, like, oh man, what if you know you're not eligible for DEERS, but it's still populating because of, you know, some sort of

158
00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:18.109
P9: yeoman error, you know, that made that error. That can be a pain. So, do I trust it? I mean, yeah, not to put a number, but it's gonna be 95% accurate, so he's just gonna have those.

159
00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:22.700
P9: Those poor souls that have to go, make some calls.

160
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.019
Renata: Got it. So what would you do after seeing this message?

161
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720
P9: for me.

162
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:48.809
P9: I would click the little red X up in the corner and probably go back to day drinking. I'm kidding. No, at this point, I would, you know, cease the application, understanding that I'm eligible for TRICARE. Then I'd go apply for TRICARE.

163
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:56.809
Renata: Okay, got it. And if you believe that this alert was wrong, that you're not actually eligible for TRICARE, what would you do at this point?

164
00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:11.949
P9: Yeah, great question. I mean, that's where, like I was saying earlier, a phone number or some sort of, you know, right here, like, I'm stuck. Like, okay, now what do I do with my hands? You know, I don't… who do I call? Who do I… you know, hey, if you…

165
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:18.730
P9: don't think you're… if you don't think you're eligible for DEERS, here's a link, because there is a link where you can,

166
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:35.589
P9: To all the, ID card offices for… across the services and make an appointment. That's how I did mine when I moved here, as a civilian. So… and as my kids are turning 10, you know, it's not a hard thing. So making that online appointment.

167
00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:41.210
P9: As you're close. Most folks are gonna be near some sort of…

168
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:51.820
P9: you know, military base, National Guard center, whatever. If they're near VA, particularly, they're gonna be able to, make those,

169
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:57.489
P9: contacts, so… Got it. Sorry, I was a little bit of rambling there, did I answer the question?

170
00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:08.119
Renata: Not a problem at all, we love rambling. I just want to repeat back to make sure that I understand, though. You mentioned that there are ID card offices through TRICARE, so some sort of link here, maybe.

171
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:21.679
P9: Yeah, absolutely, or if you think, you know, again, through the VA, phone number, but I know there are… there's definitely links, like, hey, if you think you're not eligible, or if you have questions about your deer status.

172
00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:33.820
P9: here's a link to, you know, find your local, ID slash deer's office, I think is what they call them, and make an… for… to make an appointment, so…

173
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.360
Renata: Okay.

174
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:41.339
P9: Something along… that's my suggestion, or… and on the flip side, the VA, if there's a VA contact link.

175
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:43.959
P9: Phone number, and the such.

176
00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:52.529
Renata: Got it, okay. So, sounds like you would sort of take steps to verify your information in DEERS or at VA to make sure that this was.

177
00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.949
P9: Join me somewhere. I'm kind of stuck here, so a couple helpful vectors would be nice.

178
00:23:57.330 --> 00:24:03.840
Renata: Got it. And does it feel like the system is helping you understand your options, or is the system blocking you at this point?

179
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:12.109
P9: Well, at this point, I would say it's a block. It's just not providing, like I said, any sort of options here. Like, you're not eligible.

180
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.670
P9: Alright.

181
00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:20.619
Renata: I'm gonna have you go ahead and click continue as if you saw this and went, okay, but I still want to apply today.

182
00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:34.429
P9: I understand, and I should backtrack. I understand it says may not be eligible, I… words mean things, I get it, but and again, for me, if I were to see this, I'd probably want to contact my dears, figure out what's.

183
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:35.080
Renata: Got it.

184
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.850
P9: Got it.

185
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:58.779
P9: Again, a big… oh, there you go, a little how to check for TRICARE eligibility, that's good. I probably would have used that… not saying it's not bad here, but maybe also back there as well, because that's the first thing I did. I probably would have Googled.

186
00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:05.200
P9: I started Googling that stuff, you know, TRICARE eligibility, so if I had that link earlier, you'd have just saved me a step.

187
00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.580
Renata: And again, I'm sorry. No, no, please, I want to hear your thoughts.

188
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:19.419
P9: Again, seeing that, like I described, the red X, you know, it's always bad.

189
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:24.269
P9: It's never a good thing, especially when you're flying planes, so…

190
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.629
P9: Yeah, at this point, I would think I'm probably not eligible.

191
00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:34.210
Renata: Okay, so would you take the same or a different action as compared to the other prototype that you looked at?

192
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.720
P9: What was my action there? I'm trying to recall.

193
00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.800
Renata: I think you said green means go, so you.

194
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.139
P9: Yeah, oh yeah, so I continued here.

195
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:44.710
P9: Hmm.

196
00:25:47.110 --> 00:26:00.520
P9: Well, it depends on how strongly I felt about, you know, my eligibility with, DEERS. If I, like, hey, if I'm in Deers and I'm eligible, man, I just don't… I don't think I'm eligible, you know, why even apply?

197
00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.220
P9: But if I'm, you know.

198
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.630
P9: Again, words mean things, doesn't… it may, but…

199
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:18.950
P9: Yeah, again, it's just breaking down, I guess, your personal situation. You know, some people say an X, and that's not going to stop them, you know. There's a waiver for everything, as we say in the military.

200
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:27.680
P9: Yeah. So, you know, again, for me personally, I probably would exit at this point.

201
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.970
P9: But…

202
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:41.239
P9: certainly if I was looking for options, particularly for my dependents, so if I was in a different situation, I would probably continue until somebody told me no.

203
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:42.220
Renata: Okay.

204
00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:51.920
Renata: On a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very hard, and 5 being very easy, how difficult or easy was it to understand the second prototype of the form that you just went through?

205
00:26:52.370 --> 00:27:03.249
P9: I'd say it's just as easy, yeah. Did I say 5 last time? I think I said 5 for being easy. Whatever the easiest is, so I apologize if I… Sorry.

206
00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:10.820
Renata: No, you're totally fine. Comparing the two prototypes that you've just been to… been through, which would you prefer to use?

207
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:28.870
P9: Probably the second one, only because I saw, like I said, some of those, and I apologize if I missed those links earlier, talking about the VA eligibility, or I'm sorry, TRICARE eligibility, how to determine TRICARE eligibility. If I missed that in the first one, I apologize, but it seemed to…

208
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:38.410
P9: You know, this is almost like, you know, what do you find in the different things?

209
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:39.030
Renata: Yeah.

210
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:45.019
P9: You know, the famous, office space, office, meme, they're both the same image.

211
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:54.920
P9: I mean, I can only think of subtle differences, so they're very subtle differences, but if I had to choose, it'd probably be this one.

212
00:27:55.150 --> 00:27:57.969
Renata: Okay, got it. Thank you for that.

213
00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:00.489
P9: Frequency bias, but that's alright.

214
00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:07.760
Renata: It's totally fine. So, thinking about everything that you've just seen, was there too much, too little, or just the right amount of information?

215
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:23.339
P9: No, I think there's a good… I mean, you… it's easy to get overwhelming with the information. I know you're trying to put 10 pounds of stuff in a 5-pound sock, so… And you gotta… and thinking of senior, you know, VA, veterans.

216
00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:35.930
P9: you can't overwhelm them with information, or they're just gonna, you know, shut down. So I think this is a great, you know, you'll highlight your… and it's along what I've seen with the VA, the highlighted big blue buttons.

217
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:53.289
P9: You have those links. I think it was the right amount of information, and not requiring too much information. You know, like I said, the 214 and all that. It was just bang, bang, bang. You guys determined it through tiers. I think that was really a huge step, and

218
00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.429
P9: Yeah, I think it was the right amount of information.

219
00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.399
Renata: Got it. And if you had to explain this to a friend, would you feel confident doing so?

220
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:06.510
P9: I think so, yeah. Particularly, like I said, the, the,

221
00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:11.430
P9: Understanding that it just… there's a determinant… it's…

222
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:18.099
P9: That even if it's… if it, determines that you, Might not be eligible

223
00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:28.750
P9: You… there are… you can continue the application and, you know, again, for that person, if they wanted a…

224
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:31.340
P9: a…

225
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:43.300
P9: true determination, you know, a person, actually, or a, you know, a letter saying, no, you're not eligible. But I think this is a great process, and certainly anybody I'd rec… I would recommend this to anybody, for sure.

226
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:49.749
Renata: Got it, thank you. Go ahead and click on the continue button, it's gonna take you back to that main screen that we have.

227
00:29:50.090 --> 00:30:00.459
Renata: So now that we've gone through the second prototype, I want to walk you through some scenarios and messaging with you, just to get your feedback. So, if you click on that Warning Alerts button, the gray button at the top there, yeah.

228
00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:08.059
Renata: So, I'm going to read some scenarios to you out loud, and I'll have you review these messages.

229
00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:24.609
Renata: State any questions or feedback or any actions that you might take based on the information. So we're gonna start with the first alert, Alert A. In this scenario, I want you to imagine that you've entered your information, and then you see the following message, Alert A.

230
00:30:24.610 --> 00:30:31.069
Renata: Please, think aloud. Let me know what your thoughts are around what this alert means, and explain what you might do if you saw this.

231
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:40.089
P9: That's a very frustrating alert in the sense of, you know, check your information. I don't know how many times I've gotten that, and my information's correct.

232
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:45.620
P9: So… and then, you know, bam, I'm just right back to that alert, and I'm stuck in a loop.

233
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.150
Renata: Okay. So…

234
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:57.660
Renata: You've seen this before, it's frustrating, you check your information, anything that you do beyond that, other than checking to make sure that it's all correct.

235
00:30:57.660 --> 00:30:58.910
P9: Yep.

236
00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:03.550
Renata: Okay, so I'm gonna, yeah, you already scrolled down to Alert B.

237
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:13.919
P9: So in this scenario, again, you've entered your information just as before, but now you see this message. Think aloud, let me know your thoughts around what the alert means and what actions you might take.

238
00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:19.050
P9: Same… same thoughts. You know, if I… if I…

239
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:32.239
P9: Although, when it's saying right now, I get the thought, like, is this a server issue, you know, something I need to come back to. That can certainly be internal,

240
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.250
P9: So…

241
00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:42.209
P9: I get that sometimes, you know, just close it all out, and then come back to it. That can be frustrating, but understandable.

242
00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:50.759
Renata: Okay, so if I'm hearing you correctly, this one's frustrating, but it sounds like it's a server system site issue, so you'd close out and you'd come back at some point.

243
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.379
P9: Yeah, and I guess I, you know, right, and the difference is, I guess…

244
00:31:56.030 --> 00:32:05.320
P9: because the first one says, we can't find your veteran's information. That tells me that they're in the server. This one tells me they can't even get in the server. Does that make sense? That's what it tells me.

245
00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:19.210
Renata: Got it, alright. You can go to Alert C now. So, same scenario as Alert B, you've entered your information and you see this alert. Again, let me know any impressions you have about this, and sort of what actions you might take.

246
00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:20.990
P9: I think it goes back to,

247
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.460
P9: My first one, on Alert A.

248
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:27.480
Renata: Okay.

249
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:33.729
P9: or select continue. Now, if it let me select continue, we can't confirm the eligibility.

250
00:32:35.140 --> 00:32:35.880
P9: of…

251
00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:45.129
P9: Now, if it let me click continue the application, I'd just continue it. I guess it's whether that's an alert that's, you know, a stop.

252
00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:54.070
P9: Or it's an alert, it's just a, you know, more of a notice, where it lets me continue, because it does say, or select continue to complete your application.

253
00:32:54.550 --> 00:33:01.160
P9: so I guess it depends on what this alert makes me do. Does that make sense?

254
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:07.979
Renata: Yeah, that does. If you saw this after you'd entered your information in, would you click continue if you saw this?

255
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:22.559
P9: Well, I verify my information, you know, check the information, or going back to my first point, like, I usually do, I'm usually pretty good on that, but if I did that, and I clicked continue, and I got this alert again, I'd be very frustrated.

256
00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:35.710
P9: Got it. But if it let me continue, it'd be like, okay, maybe it was just kind of verifying, yes, I can't confirm my eligibility right now for whatever information, but it's allowing me to continue that, eligibility process, or that

257
00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:37.940
P9: application process.

258
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:45.740
Renata: For this scenario, would you feel more confident now, before continuing applying than the other alerts that you saw?

259
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:56.370
P9: Hmm, that's a good question. Yes, probably.

260
00:33:56.650 --> 00:34:03.729
P9: Yeah, I think I would, just because it couldn't be confirmed now.

261
00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.199
P9: Yeah, I think I would.

262
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.210
Renata: Okay, got it. We're gonna move on to Alert D.

263
00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:25.669
P9: So in this scenario, you entered your information, and your information was located, and you see this message. So what would you do? Is there any additional information that you'd want to see here?

264
00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:39.719
P9: I think, yeah, as I mentioned earlier, just maybe… I love this alert. This is a much more informative, alert. I ate those ones, just like, we can't check it. No, we, you know, we got it, you know, you may not be eligible.

265
00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:53.599
P9: For this, but as I mentioned earlier, maybe a link to where, Deere's offices are located, so if you needed to con… you know, start giving them some vectors, is this… is this a deer's problem? Is this a VA problem? Kind of,

266
00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:55.689
P9: Helping them along those lines.

267
00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:56.170
Renata: Got it.

268
00:34:56.179 --> 00:35:00.299
P9: That's my feedback on that, but I really like that alert.

269
00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:13.339
Renata: All right, thank you. And we're going to go to that last alert there, Alert E. So, you've entered everything in, you see this alert, what would you do? Is there any additional information that you'd want to see here?

270
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.460
P9: Green is good. I'm continuing.

271
00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:23.980
Renata: Okay, across all the alert messages that you've seen here, how confident you feel that you'd know what to do based on what the alerts are telling you?

272
00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:30.050
P9: Yeah, I… like I said, you know, I think I expressed my,

273
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:47.689
P9: where I'd be a little frustrated, I guess, depending on the response, after I corrected my, you know, checked my information, all that kind of stuff. If I was able to continue, okay, that's great, but this was a, you know, a stop, like, you can't continue until this is fixed. Particularly the one, I think it said,

274
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:57.190
P9: You can try again later. I'm like, son of a… okay, that's probably a server issue, I'll just come back. But, you know, it happens. Hopefully, people understand that.

275
00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.310
Renata: Yeah.

276
00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:02.089
Renata: Were any of the alerts confusing or unclear?

277
00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:11.349
P9: Well, I think A would be, you know, certainly confusing, particularly if I checked my info, you know,

278
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:25.820
P9: we couldn't find the, veteran information in the system. What do you mean? You know, for me personally, you know, I just did 25 years and can't find my information in there. That'd be a little frustrating. But…

279
00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:43.599
P9: again, going to just the more information, I think, in these alerts, the better. Or at least vectors, you know, providing links, or where to, you know, hey, go check this, go check this. I think that would definitely help a little bit.

280
00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:57.990
Renata: Got it. So, if I'm hearing you correctly, like, any links to actionable steps that you can take to make sure that, like, hey, if I'm in Deers and I'm not supposed to be, or hey, the veteran's not showing up in the system, what can I do to, like.

281
00:36:58.410 --> 00:36:59.959
Renata: Make this problem go away.

282
00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.129
P9: You said it better than I did. Yep.

283
00:37:02.130 --> 00:37:05.010
Renata: Or Dad, write that down, alright?

284
00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:06.010
P9: That's exactly right.

285
00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:09.759
Renata: Tributed to you, In the, in the.

286
00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.820
P9: There's AI by your words over my mouth.

287
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:20.270
Renata: So at this point, you can scroll down to the bottom, and there should be a little blue button that says to return to the, yeah, the prototype menu.

288
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:41.889
Renata: So we have one more task for you. I'd like your feedback on several messages that you saw towards the end of our prototypes, yeah. So, on this screen, you're gonna see four summary cards. The first two, card style A, are from the prototypes that you already went through, and the third and fourth cards, card style B, are alternative designs. I'd like you to just take a look at all four, and then I have some questions for you.

289
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:43.200
P9: Yes, ma'am.

290
00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:01.590
P9: Sorry, apologies there.

291
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:02.670
Renata: Oh, it's okay.

292
00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.740
P9: Let me just mute that real quick, apologies, mom's getting home.

293
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:53.469
P9: All right, for me, it's probably the Card B style, you know, that second, that sub-paragraph heading, you know, your responses met all the eligibility requirements. That's a very definitive statement, where instead of, you know, your responses in the Card A style, I, I really like that definitive, statement, and…

294
00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.820
P9: Again, on the second one, where, you know, the,

295
00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.139
P9: it didn't mean it, you know, it clearly explains it. I think that's a very,

296
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.500
P9: Good explanation, explanatory, subheading.

297
00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:21.340
Renata: Okay, so card style B is easier to understand at a glance to you, and it's that, that, that subhead that's helping you. Okay, got it. Is there any part of any of the cards here that is unclear or confusing to you?

298
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:33.609
P9: No, ma'am. The only thing I would… and this… it's just, you know, happy to glad stuff, just the alignment of those checks and X's, you know, just making sure they kind of line up.

299
00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:41.979
P9: We're an annual bunch in the military. How it's up a little bit, just making sure it's on that same line.

300
00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.879
Renata: Yeah, we will… we will get into the pixels when.

301
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.240
P9: I know.

302
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.520
Renata: First thing's over.

303
00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.680
P9: It's just… again, I hope that helps.

304
00:39:49.680 --> 00:40:00.640
Renata: Yeah, no, I appreciate it. So we're done with the screen share portion. You can go ahead and exit out of the screen share, and I have just a few more questions for you before we wrap up.

305
00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:01.460
P9: Yes, ma'am.

306
00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:15.550
Renata: All right. So, is there any other feedback you'd like to add about any of the prototypes or messages that you saw today?

307
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:25.929
P9: No, no, very online, very, I think they're very useful, and you guys can… you can tell you guys have put in the hard work on it.

308
00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:33.020
Renata: All right. Do you have a preference for how eligibility clarity should be added to an online form?

309
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:39.940
P9: Well, I certainly like the, inter, interact and,

310
00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:58.659
P9: interoperability with deers. Certainly, in my world, that's a big issue, is interoperability between systems. So, kind of seeing some of that success, is going to make things way more efficient. So, continue progressing in that realm.

311
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:07.310
Renata: Got it, thank you. I'm just gonna check to see if any of the observers have any questions, but I don't see any, so do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?

312
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:13.349
P9: No, no, I appreciate your time. That was, I hope… hopefully… hopefully this was helpful to your study.

313
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:24.659
Renata: everything is helpful at this point, we just… we love gathering feedback on folks' experiences. I want to circle back and reconfirm that you're comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?

314
00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.580
P9: Yes, ma'am.

315
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:30.019
Renata: Alright, is there any part of our discussion you would not want shared in a video clip?

316
00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:31.980
P9: Mmm… no, ma'am.

317
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:43.939
Renata: All right. Well, Will, we really appreciate you taking time out of your day and your week to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback's super helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans and their families, so thank you.

318
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:59.380
Renata: Lastly, Paragian, the folks who set this, interview up, will be sending you a little thank you note with a blurb that you can pass along to other veterans that you may know, providing them the chance to participate in future research studies, but with that, thank you so much again. Enjoy the rest of your week. I hope you have a good weekend, too.

319
00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.900
P9: Thank you. You, exactly. You as well, guys.

320
00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:05.280
Renata: Alright, thank you, have a good one.

321
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.390
P9: Aches, guys.

322
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.160
Renata: Bye.
