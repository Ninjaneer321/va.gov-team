# Research Plan for IVC, 10-10D/10-7959c merge Usability Study

## Background üèóÔ∏è
<details><summary>Briefly describe the background of your product.</summary>

Applicants seeking CHAMPVA benefits must complete and submit VA Form 10-10d for benefits enrollment and VA Form 10-7959c for Other Health Insurance (OHI) certification separately. To enhance user experience and streamline operations, we propose merging these two forms into a single, cohesive digital application process.‚Äã

Applicants are required to submit VA Form 10-10d and VA Form 10-7959c separately, leading to potential redundancy and increased processing times. This dual-submission process can be burdensome for users and may delay the overall application process. Our goal is to merge the submission processes to reduce the load on both the time it takes a veteran to submit, and the time it takes the approval team to process and approve applications.

* How might we simplify the CHAMPVA application and OHI supporting docs process to allow applicants to submit both benefits enrollment and OHI certification seamlessly in a single digital experience?

* How can we reduce processing times by merging the CHAMPVA and OHI forms?
  
`Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)`

The CHAMPVA Benefits application and OHI forms are available both as authenticated and unauthenticated forms.
  
`What is Veterans‚Äô familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?`

We have already successfully launched CHAMPVA Benefits applications and OHI forms. This process will merge them together so veterans can complete both in the same experience.

## Research Goals ü•Ö	

### Goals

1. Understand whether the placement of the 10-7959c within the 10-10D application for CHAMPVA benefits works better, as it relates to form submission and time on task.

2. Understand if the placement of the 10-7959c within the 10-10D form works better for users, specifically as it relates to providing all necessary and required supporting evidence.

### Research questions
> [!NOTE]
> Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the` [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md)

***Consider bucketing research questions under research goals and think about:***

### Hypotheses
> [!NOTE]
> Remember to constrain the hypotheses to the goals of your study!
 
**Think through these prompts to develop strong hypotheses:**
	
`What do you intend to learn and measure from this study?` 

`What do you already know about this problem space?`
 
`What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don‚Äôt skip this step!)`
  
`Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.`

## Recruitment üéØ	
*OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.*

> [!NOTE]
> Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources: 
> - [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
> - [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
*Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them?* 
- Perigean **CANNOT** recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, [unmoderated studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/perigean-recruiting-process-for-unmoderated-studie), however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. 
- Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

- **Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants.**
- Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

- The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria.
- Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria.
- Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Review an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/pre-mhv-prototype/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md)

### List the ideal completed sessions and total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study:
> [!NOTE]
> Your total number should equal **1.5x** your ideal completed sessions number *(e.g. for 10 ideal completed sessions, request 15 total participants)*

- `Caregivers:` **[n]**
- `Dependents:` **[n]**

## Timeline üóìÔ∏è
> [!NOTE]
> **Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.** 

### Optional Kick-off Call with Perigean

- `Suggested dates and times:` **[Enter dates and times MM/DD HH:MM]**

### Prepare
*When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).*

**A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.** 
> [!NOTE]
> **Send pilot participant email in study Slack channel**

- `Date and time of pilot session:` **[Enter time]** 

### Research sessions
- `Planned dates of research:` **[Enter dates MM/DD-MM/DD]**

### Length of sessions
- `Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)` **[Enter time length]**
  
- `Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)` **[Enter buffer time]**
  
- `Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)` **[Enter NUM per day]**

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. 

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. 

> [!TIP]
> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. **(e.g. 3/17, Monday 9:00AM-1:00PM, 3:00PM-6:00PM EST; 3/18, Tuesday 9:00AM-6:00PM EST, etc.;** ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
