# Should we pursue requesting a PoA doc on the 1010d if third party/VSO for MVP? 


## What we know



- The PDF does not ask or mention a PoA needed. 
- Stakeholders were unaware of the alternate signer forms. As of now they don't ask for any additional forms to be filed by Alt signers or additional docs to be uploaded. \
In a March update luke had mentioned that If you include a POA as an optional form and state if you do not have a POA in with the VBA please attach one with your 10 10 D application
- There may be a case that they need to contact the signer if the applicant is incapacitated and the signer is the Power of Authority.
- Only a spouse can fill out for another spouse or child under 23. Anyone else would need a POA
- Need to be at least 18 to be a PoA
- CHAMPVA can accept non-VA PoA forms


## What we don’t know 



- What is the equivalent form VA to use for PoA and when direct confirmation of what is acceptable to use for CHAMPVA enrollment.
    Here’s what I found on VA.gov
    - VA Form 10-0137
    - VA form 2122
    - VA Form 2122a
- What form should a non-VSO third party fill out?
    - Is it the 21-22a or something different?
- What is the process and/or info needed for VSO to fill out the form for someone else. 
   - Do they need to fill out a specific form that is different then what a non-VSO third party needs to fill out. 
- Does a parent need a PoA if there is child is over 18 or over 23 and rated as a “helpless child”
- Does adding this violate PRA?
- Do we need to only ask for a PoA on the enrollment form or do you need this on the OHI and Claims form as well. What if the person filling out the enrollment form for the beneficiary is different then someone filling out the claims. 
- How do we tell if a person needs to submit a POA versus someone that already has on file for CHAMPVA/VA
- What is the volume of people submitting a PoA?
- What is the volume of VSO that needs to submit a PoA?
- Are there documents required to prove that the parent can fill out the form on behalf of that child that is over 23? 
- Will the PoA be filed with VBA eventually.  Do we want to encourage them to send the POA to IVC or somehow send them to VBA instead?


## What would need to happen to include the PoA in the workflow



- Add the additional upload screen/ workflows
- Add a branch of screener questions/ doc upload screen for VSO versus third party signers
- Write specific content to inform people how to obtain of send a PoA
- If it violates the PRA we will need to build a business case and get permission to add it.
