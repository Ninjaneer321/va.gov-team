## Background / Problem Statement  
CHAMPVA beneficiaries currently receive their benefits card exclusively via postal mail. This delivery model introduces delays, creates friction when cards are lost or damaged, and limits beneficiary access compared to other public and private health insurance programs that provide digital or self-service card options. Beneficiaries lack the ability to view, retrieve, or request a card digitally, which can delay access to care and generate repeated outreach to the program.

Operational data highlights the scale of this issue. In October 2025 alone, CHAMPVA sent 8,536 replacement benefits cards, 65,432 ID card packets, and 1,999 send-back letters. These volumes reflect both high beneficiary need and significant operational effort tied to mail-based fulfillment. Together, this indicates a clear opportunity to improve beneficiary experience, reduce rework, and modernize CHAMPVA service delivery through digital access to benefits card information.

## Opportunity  
Providing digital access to CHAMPVA benefits card information—through viewing, requesting, or retrieving a card online—would align the program with modern health insurance expectations and VA digital standards. This initiative has the potential to reduce mail dependency, shorten time to benefit use, and lower operational burden, while improving clarity and confidence for beneficiaries.

This initiative encompasses discovery, design, and delivery work necessary to responsibly enable digital benefits card access, informed by policy, technical feasibility, and user needs.

## Goals & Outcomes  

### User Outcomes  
- Beneficiaries can access benefits card information without waiting for mail delivery  
- Reduced need to request replacement cards due to loss or delivery delays  
- Increased confidence in enrollment status and readiness to access care  

### Business / Platform Outcomes  
- Reduced volume of mailed ID cards and replacement requests  
- Lower operational costs and staff time spent on reissuance and follow-up  
- A scalable, standards-aligned digital capability that can evolve over time

## OKR Alignment  

This initiative directly supports Health Applications and VES Program OKRs related to faster access to benefits, improved digital experiences, and reduced reliance on manual workflows.

### Supports Objective 1: All form experiences help Veterans and family members get benefits faster  
- Reduces dependence on mailroom and manual fulfillment processes by enabling digital access to benefits cards  
- Shortens time between enrollment and ability to use benefits by eliminating mailing delays  

### Supports Objective 2: Digital experiences allow Veterans and family members to find and access benefits faster than manual methods  
- Provides a digital alternative that beneficiaries can access on demand, reducing preference for manual or mailed options  
- Improves beneficiary satisfaction by increasing flexibility, transparency, and control  

### Supports Objective 3: Ensure accurate transaction status for Veterans and family members  
- Enables clearer confirmation and visibility into benefits card availability or issuance status  
- Reduces errors and rework associated with lost, misdelivered, or outdated cards

## Proposed Solution / Approach  

This initiative will be delivered in phased stages to manage risk and ensure alignment with policy, security, and VA.gov standards:

1. **Discovery and Feasibility**  
   - Validate policy and compliance constraints related to digital card access  
   - Identify technical dependencies and integration points  
   - Understand beneficiary and operational needs  

2. **Design and Validation**  
   - Define user experience patterns aligned with VA.gov standards  
   - Validate concepts with beneficiaries and CHAMPVA stakeholders  
   - Confirm operational workflows and support models  

3. **Incremental Delivery**  
   - Implement approved digital access capabilities (e.g., view, download, request)  
   - Integrate monitoring, metrics, and support processes  
   - Iterate based on usage and feedback

## Scope  

### In Scope  
- Digital access to CHAMPVA benefits card information via VA.gov  
- Policy, technical, and UX work required to enable and sustain access  
- Instrumentation to measure usage, satisfaction, and operational impact  

### Out of Scope  
- Changes to CHAMPVA eligibility, enrollment criteria, or benefit rules  
- Replacement of all physical cards without an approved policy decision  
- Non-VA.gov distribution channels  

---

## Dependencies and Assumptions  

### Key Dependencies  
- Policy and compliance approval for digital benefits card access  
- VA.gov platform capabilities and integration support  
- Coordination with CHAMPVA operations and communications teams  

### Assumptions  
- Digital access will complement, not immediately replace, mailed cards  
- VA.gov will serve as the primary beneficiary-facing channel

## Risks and Mitigations  

| Risk | Mitigation |
|-----|-----------|
| Policy limitations restrict digital delivery options | Identify compliant alternatives (e.g., view-only, request-based models) |
| Technical complexity delays delivery | Use phased delivery and leverage existing VA.gov patterns |
| Uneven beneficiary adoption | Maintain mail as a fallback and provide clear guidance |

---

## Success Metrics / Outcomes  

Success will be measured by:  
- Reduction in replacement card requests and mailed ID packets  
- Decrease in beneficiary complaints or inquiries related to card access  
- Increased beneficiary satisfaction with CHAMPVA digital experiences  
- Reliable, monitored digital access meeting Health Applications and VES reliability expectations
