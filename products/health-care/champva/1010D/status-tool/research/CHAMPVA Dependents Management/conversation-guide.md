# Conversation Guide for CHAMPVA Dependents Management Discovery

## Intro - 5 minutes

Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Alyssa and I'm a UX Designer at OCTO working with Amanda on CHAMPVA. 

We're working on creating a tool for CHAMPVA applicants that would enable them to look up the status of their application, instead of calling the contact center. Today, we're trying to learn what information we can share with different types of dependents. 

I also just started on this project a couple months ago, so I'm still getting up to speed on acronyms. I'd really appreciate if you could share as much detail as you can -- so I can make sure I'm getting enough context and understanding you correctly. 

- Any questions before we get started?
- Is it okay to record this conversation for notetaking purposes? 

## Questions

1. Could you each tell me about your role and what you do?   

2. Could you walk me through, step-by-step, what you do when you receive a call from a veteran asking for their CHAMPVA application status?
    - How do you verify who they are?
      - What system or documents are you referencing?
    - What types of questions do you normally receive?
    - How do you decide what you are allowed to share with them?
  
3. As I mentioned earlier, we'd love your help understanding case by case what information we can share with different types of dependents. To structure our conversation, I've made these two tables of all the different cases we'd like to learn about. [Share screen] I'm going to take notes in each box as we chat.
  
4. Let's say the Veteran applied for ChampVA benefits on behalf of his entire family. The Veteran calls in for a status update on their application and we are missing documents from their spouse.
      - What information are we able to share about their spouse?
      - What if we are missing a school certification for a 19 year old daughter in college? What information are we able to share about the daughter?
      - Or a child under the age of 18?
      - What if the daughter, spouse, or minor child was the applicant?   

5. What about if it's a spouse calling?
    - How often does this happen?
    - How do you verify who they are?
    - What types of questions do you normally receive?
    - If they are calling about their own application, how do you decide what you are allowed to share with them?
      - Can they know any of the Veteran's information that wasn't already in their application?
    - If they are calling about another dependent's application (i.e. their child who filled out a separate application), how do you decide what you are allowed to share with them?
      - Does this differ based on the child’s age?

6. What if it's a child over 18 calling?

7. What if it's a child under 18 calling?

8. Do you have any documentation for these guidelines? Would you be able to share them with me?
  
9. Who makes these guidelines?
    - What laws or policies inform the guidelines?
    - Is there any room to change these guidelines based on insights from user research?
  
10. If only one beneficiary is missing information, can the other beneficiaries on the application be marked as complete/eligible? Or does the entire application go back to the end of the queue? 

11. If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about this process, what would it be?

12. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me? 

Thanks so much for your time!
