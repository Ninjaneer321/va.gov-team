# Research Plan for CHAMPVA Dependents Management Discovery, 09/2025

## Research Goals 🥅	

### Goals

Talk to 3 CHAMPVA business stakeholders for 1 hour to see how they currently manage sharing information with dependents for the call center, which may give us better insight for specific CHAMPVA business rules for sharing information across family members

### Research questions
	
`1.` How does the contact center share information between Veterans and different family members?  

`2.` What rules and business processes do they have for sharing information?  

`3.` How might rules of sharing application status to a Veteran change depending on if they’re asking about:  

  - a child 18-23 and currently enrolled in college?
  - minor children?
  - their spouse?   

`4.` How might rules of sharing application status to a Veteran’s spouse change depending on if they’re asking about:  

  - a child 18-23 and currently enrolled in college?
  - minor children?
  - the Veteran?   

`5.` Who is responsible for creating business process rules for dependent management and sharing across family members?   

`6.` What are their legal barriers? 

## Team Roles  🕵️👩‍💻👩‍🔬

- `Moderator:` **Alyssa Li and Amanda Klausmeier**	
- `Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):` **Alyssa Li and Amanda Klausmeier**		
- `Participant recruiting & screening:`	**Amanda Klausmeier**
