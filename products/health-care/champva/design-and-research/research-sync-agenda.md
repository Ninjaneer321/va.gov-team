# Running Design and Research Agenda

## June 6, 2024
Attendees: Rachael Penfil, Steven Straily, Lois Lewis, Mary Wang, Premal Shah, Devi Hill

### Agenda topics
- Andy is out starting next Monday until week of July 1, and the design CoP presentation isn't until July 8. With this in mind, I would to suggest that Steven and I focus on the 10-10d report this sprint and the readouts next sprint.
  - This is good to go.
- Priority: CHAMPVA claims stakeholder interviews vs. CHAMPVA user journey map. I would suggest that we focus on stakeholder interviews because we don't really know anything about the CHAMPVA claims backend systems and processes.
  - Stakeholder research: 10-7959a
  - Lois is not sure that the journey map is not as useful as a task flow map that we could get from stakeholders - that's the product and engineering need.
  - Happy to have Jamie and Syd work on the stakeholder research
  - Do we need the behavioral notes on this?
  - Focus on process. Can't change their jobs that much.
  - Will be doing 4 interivews. Will need after actions.
  - Might even want to say: we want to diagram this process.
  - Make it less formal, more conversational.
  - Include: ask probing questions about OHI, content questions, how you know there's fraud, etc.
  - Premal wants the workflow diagram. Maybe we hand off to product to do a workflow diagram while Jamie and Syd work on the larger findings.
  - Main object needs to be: how does a claim get processed?

### Decisions and action items
- Steven and I will focus on 10-10d analysis and do readout decks next sprint.
- We can start scheduling stakeholder interviews for CHAMPVA claims.
- First thing to come out of CHAMPVA claims is workflow diagram. Perhaps can be informed by what Bo and Mary have already done, if they have questions aren't on our list.

### Agenda topics
- 10-10d update - [analysis Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1712766096062/a4141cf44d7867853fb69698ea6003aa2216d5d4?wid=0-1717015651965&sender=u3844370d13a440a7859d3526)
- July 8 FMP readout at Monday meeting / currently unscheduled stakeholder readout
- CHAMPVA claim stakeholder interviews
  - Lois: We have a prototype, we have screens. What is the goal for stakeholder interviews? We may not need the process from FMP, with full affinity mapping. 
  - Rachael + Steven: Biggest pieces of info that we're missing: service and process. How does a claim get processed? How are things functioning on the back end? What are the most common errors from the perspectives of stakeholders?
  - Lois: Wants to see a research plan.
  - Lois: Maybe use CHAMPVA Monday meeting to see who we need to talk to to answer those questions. Some of our stakeholders have changed.
- Future research: I'm wondering if it makes sense to watch forms / claims processors once we have a form in production or maybe pre-production to understand the new digital form experience from the processor perspective.

### Decisions and action items
- Work on 10-10d GH report first, then after that we can stakeholder readout
- Stakeholder readout: aim for delivering in Sprint 20.
  - 8 hours for drafts of both decks, to 2 hrs to make any changes after Lois and Premal's review
  - Shorter is better. After the first readout, two weeks later, come back with specific workshop items where we present findings and design changes and work on them together.
  - Work on research plan for CHAMPVA claims (7959a).
    - Look at the questions Syd had for 59a and see if we can roll them into stakeholder interviews, and if we even need  to ask them at all.
  - Add future research item to backlog.
