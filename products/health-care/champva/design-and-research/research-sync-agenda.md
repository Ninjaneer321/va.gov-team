# Running Design and Research Agenda

## May 30, 2024
### Agenda topics
- 10-10d update
- July 8 FMP readout at Monday meeting / currently unscheduled stakeholder readout
- CHAMPVA claim stakeholder interviews
- Future research: I'm wondering if it makes sense to watch forms / claims processors once we have a form in production or maybe pre-production to understand the new digital form experience from the processor perspective.
