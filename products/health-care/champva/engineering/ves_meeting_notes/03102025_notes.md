# VES meeting notes - March 10th, 2025 @ 3pm ET

## Our questions/VES team answers:
- Question: _What is VES expecting in the `application_type` field?_
  - Answer: There is an enum (currently just one value: ‘CHAMPVA’)
- Question: _Is there a specific format we need to use for dates? Based off of testing, it looks like yyyy-dd-mm, but there's no regex in the schema (unlike SSNs and Phone numbers) ._
  - Answer: The proper format is YYYY-MM-DD

API Schema field `SignatureAadress` typo will get fixed by the VES team.

Based on a test submit made from our end to VES on February 7, this is what the submission data looks like in their system:

```javascript
{
  "applicationType": "some_application_type",
  "applicationUUID": "some_unique_uuid",
  "sponsor": {
    "personUUID": "some_unique_uuid",
    "lastName": "Johnson",
    "firstName": "Joe",
    "ssn": "123123123",
    "vaFileNumber": "",
    "dateOfBirth": "2000-01-01",
    "isDeceased": true,
    "dateOfDeath": "2000-01-01",
    "isDeathOnActiveService": false,
    "address": {
      "streetAddress": "NA",
      "city": "NA",
      "state": "NA",
      "zipCode": "NA"
    }
  },
  "beneficiaries": [
    {
      "personUUID": "some_unique_uuid",
      "lastName": "Alvin",
      "firstName": "Johnny",
      "middleInitial": "T",
      "ssn": "345345345",
      "emailAddress": "johnny@alvin.gov",
      "phoneNumber": "(123) 123-1234",
      "gender": "MALE",
      "enrolledInMedicare": true,
      "hasOtherInsurance": true,
      "relationshipToSponsor": "CHILD",
      "address": {
        "streetAddress": "456 Circle Street",
        "city": "Clinton",
        "state": "AS",
        "zipCode": "56790"
      },
      "dateOfBirth": "2000-01-01"
    }
  ],
  "certification": {
    "signature": "certifier jones",
    "lastName": "Jones",
    "firstName": "Certifier",
    "middleInitial": ""
  }
}

```

Currently, they're having technical issues with their development server. Once their technical issues are resolved we're clear to send some more test submits through and verify the data flow works as expected.
