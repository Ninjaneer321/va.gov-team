key_findings:
  - "5/6 participants recalled getting the 1095-B form in the mail from the VA when explained in the context of it being 'proof of health insurance' or 'health coverage' form"
  - "Many explained that when they got it in the mail, they filed it away for safe keeping until it was time for them to file their taxes or send their files to a tax preparer. Some made electronic copies of it"
  - "4/6 participants preferred digital delivery. The remaining 2 participants, who were both over 65 years old, were comfortable with digital but preferred paper due to a sense of security and ease"
  - "Reasons cited for preferring digital were: ease of use / less hassle than paper, efficiency, ability to organize, and environmental benefits of saving paper"
  - "Participants generally liked the ability to sign up for paperless delivery, with many of the same reasons cited as preferring digital download"
  - "5/6 participants were negative towards calling a customer service phone number"
  - "Expectation that there would be a long wait if they needed to call to update the form. Digital is seen as an opportunity to avoid the hassle, with an expectation they could update the form via online methods"
  - "2/6 participants said they wouldn't bother calling the customer service number if their address was wrong on the document"
  - "4/6 Participants were unclear if they actually needed the 1095-B to submit with their taxes"
  - "All participants reported keeping the 1095-B document with their other files, in preparation for filing their taxes themselves or sending it to a tax preparer"
  - "Only one participant lived in a state where it was needed to file with their State taxes"
  - "4/6 Participants went to the Records panel first, with the remaining 2/6 participants going to the Health care panel first"
  - "There was no clear link under Records where participants might expect to find the 1095-B without the title being changed"
  - "Only one participant said they would try 'search' unprompted, and only 2 went to the main navigation in the header unprompted"
  - "The main flow from sign-in to download was well understood, participants found the download CTA quickly"
  - "Method to fix errors with the 1095-B PDF was clear - Participants generally saw the FAQ question and associated telephone number regarding incorrect information, before they opened the actual 1095-B form"
  - "Design and content was well received, clear and easy to use"
recommendations:
  - "The design for downloading the 1095-B is clear and well understood, with all participants easily completing the task of viewing the document. No major design changes needed"
  - "Reduced some written content to be more direct and less redundant; Clarified content on state requirements and included the affordable care act link in body copy"
  - "Improved visual hierarchy in high fidelity designs"
  - "For next round of user testing with high fidelity designs, further explore preferences around updating the form (if information is incorrect) and how the participants understand the requirements of filing"
  - "Keeping directions with how to fix information near the download CTA is likely important going forward"
  - "It is likely that most traffic to the 1095-B landing page will result from emails directly linking the 1095-B page, as well as Google searches. A top level link on the homepage is not necessary nor recommended"

# Background

Currently, form 1095-B is mailed to Veterans. Sending it out costs the VA approximately $1.5 million, and an additional $400,000 if they have to re-send it due to an error on the form. What&#39;s more, the form isn&#39;t available online, so if a Veteran loses the form, they have no easy way to get an immediate replacement. [Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/product/1095B-Tax-Form-Product-Outline.md)

## Research Goals

- Better understand how Veterans might find, use, and edit a digital copy of the 1095b form
- Discover needs, pain points and preferences for physical or digital delivery of the form
- Test usability of proposed solution

## Research Questions

- Are Veterans familiar with the 1095b form, why they might need it and what is their experience of receiving it in the past?
- Do Veterans prefer a physical or digital copy of the form? Why might a Veteran opt out of future physical delivery of a form?
- What are the strategies and touchpoints a Veteran might use for locating the form online?

## Overview &amp; Methods

- 10 45-minute research sessions with Veterans scheduled
  - After no shows and cancellations, we completed **6 full sessions successfully meeting our minimum**.
  - A 7th session was conducted but shortened and modified to meet participant capabilities.
- 3 Parts of the session included: 15 minute interview, 20 minute think aloud usability test with prototype of proposed solution, 10 minute VA.gov wayfinding activity
- All sessions conducted remotely via Zoom

# Overall Findings

- Design and content was well received, clear and easy to use
- The main flow from sign-in to download was well understood, participants found the download CTA quickly
- Method to fix errors with the 1095-B PDF was clear
  - Participants generally saw the FAQ question and associated telephone number regarding incorrect information, before they opened the actual 1095-B form. This was likely due to it being a usability test, and not indicative of real world behavior.
  - Keeping directions with how to fix information near the download CTA is likely important going forward

# Themes

- Recall &amp; Recognition
- Digital vs Physical Delivery
- Paperless Opt-In Delivery
- Nobody wants to make a call
- Do I need this?
- Finding the 1095-B document

### Recall &amp; Recognition

- **5/6 participants recalled getting the 1095-B form** in the mail from the VA when explained in the context of it being &quot;proof of health insurance&quot; or &quot;health coverage&quot; form.
- Many explained that when they got in the mail, they filed it away for safe keeping until it was time for them to file their taxes or send their files to a tax preparer. Some made electronic copies of the paper form for easier access or the ability to use it on their computer during tax preparation.

Participant 8 Quote:

&quot;_Every year with the healthcare law, I get the 1095 [mentioned by name, unprompted] that I provide to my accountant when he does all our taxes…_

_I just collect all that, then I create a pdf and then I drop an envelop of the hard copies off to the accountant. So that&#39;s where everything gets tucked: the 1095s, W2s, 1099&#39;s, all of it.&quot;_

### Digital vs Physical Delivery

- **4/6 participants preferred digital delivery**. The remaining 2 participants, who were both over 65 years old, were comfortable with digital but preferred paper due to a sense of security and ease
- Reasons cited for preferring digital were: ease of use / less hassle than paper, efficiency, ability to organize, and environmental benefits of saving paper

Participant 3 Quote:

&quot;_I don&#39;t need the hardcopy mail and I prefer to do things electronically. It&#39;s just a lot quicker and efficient. And saves trees and hopefully taxpayer dollars.&quot;_

Participant 7 Quote:

&quot;_I do both [physical and digital] but I probably prefer the physical mail, because then it&#39;s reminding me of these things I might need… [and] I probably am not going to lose it.&quot;_

### Paperless Opt-In Delivery

- A second version of the authenticated download screen was shown with an option to sign up for paperless delivery. **Version shown was to test concept, not execution.**
- Participants generally liked the ability to sign up for paperless delivery, with many of the same reasons cited as preferring digital download
- We didn&#39;t test larger, complex issues connected with paperless delivery: whether setting it at an individual page level vs profile/preferences level, how paperless delivery should be managed across all VA documents or in relation to email, SMS and other notification preferences.

Participant 2 Quote:

&quot;_This looks different. This is great (paperless). Less mail I get, the better. With mail, stuff gets missed our lost, so having e-delivery is great. I love to get that option…_

_I do all my bills if there&#39;s an option for paperless. I get an email and then go get it&quot;_

### Nobody Wants to Make a Call

- The prototype was tested with the MVP solution – calling a 1-800 number to the enrollment center - for updating information on the 1095-B document if some of the information was wrong.
- **5/6 participants were negative towards calling a customer service phone number.**
- Expectation that there would be a long wait if they needed to call to update the form. **Digital is seen as an opportunity to avoid the hassle** , with an expectation they could update the form via messaging or online tool
- **2/6 participants said they wouldn&#39;t bother calling the customer service number** if their address was wrong on the document. Under real world conditions, outside of usability testing, this is likely to be more common behavior.

Participant 3 Quote:

&quot;_I&#39;m not going to get on the phone for an hour and talk to somebody just to change my address...

 but if I was [going to fix it], I&#39;d be more likely to do it if there was just like an online form… Because, if it takes more than a couple days and you want to file your tax return then [the VA will] have to be pretty fast I think.&quot;_

Participant 8 Quote:

&quot;_Because you&#39;re talking about a phone number for a government entity. And some people are gonna place that in the same category as calling Comcast because their internet&#39;s out… So maybe maybe an option also to, to email, if it&#39;s feasible._

### Do I need this?

- **4/6 Participants were unclear if they actually needed the 1095-B to submit with their taxes.**
- Participant 3 attended law school and understood the legal requirements clearly.
- There seemed to be a general attitude that if the VA sends it to me its of some importance and it was connected to filing taxes.
- All participants reported keeping the 1095-B document with their other files, in preparation for filing their taxes themselves or sending it to a tax preparer.
- Only one participant lived in a state where it was needed to file with their State taxes. The remaining participants didn&#39;t need it to file.

Participant 2 Quote:

&quot;_In Turbotax, there&#39;s a checkbox that says do you need a 1095-B? I always say I got one. Guessing there&#39;s probably some kind of penalty if I didn&#39;t get one.&quot;_

Participant 6 Quote

&quot;_This particular form [1095-B], I&#39;m not sure I even need it.&quot;_

Participant 7 Quote

&quot;_It seems like they probably send me something that says I&#39;m covered for Obamacare, or or something.&quot;_

### Finding the 1095-B Document

<img width="448" alt="Example of VA.gov homepage" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22205441/155230571-4566a875-c786-47c7-8dbf-7fa3e891b540.png">

- Participants were prompted to visit the VA.gov website and asked where they might look for the 1095-B form.
- **4/6 Participants went to the Records panel first** , with the remaining 2/6 participants going to the Health care panel first.
- Asked for additional areas they might look for the document, 2 participants who initially selected Records said they might try Health care.
- Only one participant said they would try &quot;search&quot; unprompted, and only 2 went to the main navigation in the header unprompted.
- There was no clear link under Records where participants might expect to find the 1095-B without the title being changed
- It is likely that most traffic to the 1095-B landing page will result from emails directly linking the 1095-B page, as well as Google searches. A top level link on the homepage is not necessary nor recommended.
- Our team will discuss and review options with IA team going forward.

# Recommendations &amp; Next Steps

- The design for downloading the 1095-B is clear and well understood, with all participants easily completing the task of viewing the document. No major design changes needed.
- Reduced some written content to be more direct and less redundant; Clarified content on state requirements and included the affordable care act link in body copy.
- Improved visual hierarchy in high fidelity designs
- For next round of user testing with high fidelity designs, further explore preferences around updating the form (if information is incorrect) and how the participants understand the requirements of keeping the 1095-B document and including it their taxes.

### Further Research Needed
Recruitment Checker Matrix

<img width="650" alt="Round 1 Recruitment Checker Matrix" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22205441/155230641-4ecc0f54-16e8-4940-986c-25da497179d1.png">

In the next round of research we need to specify recruiting from the following groups:

1. General: cognitive disability, rural, no degree (bachelor&#39;s or above), other than honorable, immigrant origin and women
2. Race: Black, Latinx, Biracial, Asian, Native
3. Confirm LGBTQ Status
