# Research Plan for Team MOVE, 1095-B tax form February 1, 2022

## Background

Currently, form 1095-B is mailed to Veterans. Sending it out costs the VA approximately $1.5 million, and an additional $400,000 if they have to re-send it due to an error on the form. What&#39;s more, the form isn&#39;t available online, so if a Veteran loses the form, they have no easy way to get an immediate replacement.

[Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/product/1095B-Tax-Form-Product-Outline.md)

### OCTO Objectives

[See reference here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)

This project supports the OCTO goals of &quot;Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly&quot;, and &quot;Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.&quot;

### Veteran Journey

[_See Reference Here_](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

Phase 2: Living Civilian Life
 Life Stage: Putting down roots

Moment: Engaging VA to access benefits and services

## Research Goals

- Better understand how Veterans might find, use, and edit a digital copy of the 1095b form
- Discover needs, pain points and preferences for physical or digital delivery of the form
- Test usability of proposed solution

## Research Questions

- Are Veterans familiar with the 1095b form, why they might need it and what is their experience of receiving it in the past?
- Do Veterans prefer a physical or digital copy of the form? Why might a Veteran opt out of future physical delivery of a form?
- What are the strategies and touchpoints a Veteran might use for locating the form online?

### Hypothesis and Assumptions

- Mailing and receiving returned 1095b forms costs the VA a lot of money. It is not a valuable service touchpoint for Veterans, but satisfies a requirement for record keeping.
- Posting the digital form online will save the VA money and provide better service to Veterans so that they can immediately get it in the moment they need it.
- Veterans may be unsure why they need the form and not know where to look for it, as it has been previously mailed to them and not posted online.
- If the option is given to them, Veterans will be likely to select for digital delivery of the form and opt out of receiving a paper version in the future.

## Methods &amp; Location

For this round of research, we will conduct an interview followed by a moderated usability testing session with a clickable prototype. Sessions will be 45 minutes each, with a 15-minute buffer afterwards and conducted via Zoom.

## Research Materials

Prototype in Progress

## Participants &amp; Recruitment

[See Template Here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-plan.md) | [See Example Here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-plan.md)

**Participant Must Haves (Primary Criteria):**

- 10 participants scheduled (minimum 6 completed session)
  - 6-8 Participants who currently utilize VA healthcare as their primary insurance
  - 2-4 Participants who use primarily access healthcare outside the VA system

- We will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.

**Secondary Criteria:**

- Mix of users who file their taxes themselves (manually or software such as turbo tax), and those who use the services of a tax preparer or accountant.
