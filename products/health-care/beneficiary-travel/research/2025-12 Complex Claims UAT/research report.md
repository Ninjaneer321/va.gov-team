## Research Goals
Travel Pay Complex Claims UAT tested whether Veterans can easily use the new travel-claims functionality and submit claims successfully. Our goals in conducting UAT on complex claims were to:
1. Ensure a beneficiary can file a complex claim on VA.gov from start to finish. We want to ensure a user can understand the steps and limitations, start a claim, add expenses to their claim, and file a claim.
2. Test that the content, including error messages and redirects, appear properly and are clear to users.
3. Validate that users can leave, and re-enter, a claim in progress.   

**Guiding Questions:**  
- What are the key moments this tool supports in the Veteran’s journey?
  * In the Veteran journey, this work primarily falls under starting up, taking care of myself, putting down roots, and retiring.   
- What outcomes are we aiming to achieve for Veterans and stakeholders?
  * We want Veterans to successfully able to file claims with attachments on VA.gov, the first step in consolidating systems in order to eventually sunset the Beneficiary Travel Self Service System (BTSSS) portal.

## Research Questions

1. Does the user understand the qualifications around filing on VA.gov, and if they are unable to file on VA.gov, does our process successfully route them to BTSSS?
2. Are participants able to add mileage, as well as additional expenses with documentation, to their claim?
3. Can the participant successfully edit and delete an expense?
4. How does the participant navigate within the tool?
5. Can a participant leave their claim and then return to it at a later time to add expenses or submit?
6. Can the participant successfully submit a claim?   

## Methodology 

- Method 1: User acceptance testing (UAT) in production with live appointment and claims data
- Method 2: Remote, moderated. Participants were observed and guided by researchers as they filed travel reimbursement claims

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom between January 20-23, 2026. Participants were asked to login to the VA.gov accounts and file travel claims for eligible past medical appointments. We used a series of pre-determined metrics to monitor success. Because the tests were live and we had no way of knowing what scenario each participant might have, our standards determined that we needed 1 successful instance of each metric to consider the UAT complete.

Our primary metrics tracked the following scenarios:     
1. User starts a claim.    
2. User adds mileage to their claim.   
3. User continues to the additional expense flow.   
4. User uploads a file.   
5. User adds metadata to an expense.   
6. User successfully adds an additional expense (with attachment) and views it on the unsubmitted expenses page.   
7. User successfully submits a simple mileage-only claim.
8. User exits and re-enters the flow.
9. User successfully submits a claim with 1+ file (a complex claim).

We also monitored additional scenarios, or subtasks, that were not considered critical to submission:   
1. User edits an expense.
2. User cancels the editing of an expense.
3. User deletes an expense.
4. User cancels the deletion of an expense.
5. User exits the expense page before submitting.   


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

*List hypotheses explored in the research and the conclusions drawn. If applicable, list the success or task completion rate.*

> [!TIP]
> Place true or false statements in bold for easier scanability

- **Hypothesis Statement:** We hypothesize that a beneficiary will be able to complete a claim on VA.gov from start to finish. Beneficiaries may be confused by some of the nuances of complex claims, but our content and direction will allow them to successfully add expenses, edit expenses, leave a claim, re-enter, and submit a claim on VA.gov.  
  - A beneficiary will be able to complete a claim on VA.gov from start to finish.
  - A beneficiary will be able to successfully add expenses.
  - A beneficiary will be able to successfully edit expenses.
  - A beneficiary will be able to leave a claim and re-enter a claim.

  - **"Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”**
  - Supporting evidence

## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

> [!TIP]

> - "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health.'"  
> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."  
>
