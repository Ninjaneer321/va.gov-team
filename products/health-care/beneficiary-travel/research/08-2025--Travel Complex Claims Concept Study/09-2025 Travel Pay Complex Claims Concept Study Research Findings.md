## Research Goals 
As the Beneficiary Travel Team integrates complex claim submission with appointments on VA.gov, we want to understand how our users organize and approach filing travel claims with different expense types. The concept study was designed to help us understand what Veterans focus on first: the expense types or the trip itself. The study was a moderated and counterbalanced prototype study. Veterans walked through two different prototypes, one that started with expense type and one that started from the trip, and compared the ease of use and overall preference.   
Our goals were to:   
- Understand Veterans' mental models around complex claims for travel pay
- Learn whether Veterans focus primarily on their trip first or the types of expenses first as they prepare to submit

**Guiding Questions:**  
- Key Moments: This tool supports key moments in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) : Starting up, taking care of myself, putting down roots, and retiring.
- Outcomes: After learning Veterans' preference and expectations around complex claim submission, we will have research to support our higher fidelity designs. 

## Research Questions

* Based on the Intro page, do participants understand what to expect from the Claim submission process (what they will need, if they are eligible, steps)?
* When looking to get reimbursed for travel expenses, do users focus on the trip first or on what they want to be reimbursed for first?   
* Can users accomplish the key task (submitting a travel claim) using the different concepts provided?   
       a. What steps or language confuses them?   
       b. Where do they stumble in the process?   
* What do participants think will happen to the Claim after they submit?

## Methodology 

- Method 1: We conducted 45-60 minute long interviews via Zoom from August 25 - September 5, 2025. We gave participants a short hypothetical scenario around filing for travel pay.
- Method 2: Based upon the scenario provided, Veterans navigated a mid-fidelity coded [prototype](https://tfclkd.csb.app/). The study was counterbalanced, so some participants started with Version A and others started with Version B. All participants saw both versions. After each version, we asked participants about ease of use, parts of the process that they liked or didn't like, and provided the opportunity to speak further about their experience. Once participants had completed both prototypes, we asked if they had a preference or found one of the versions easier than the other. 

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

*List hypotheses explored in the research and the conclusions drawn. If applicable, list the success or task completion rate.*

> [!TIP]
> Place true or false statements in bold for easier scanability

- **Hypothesis Statement:** [Insert statement]  
  - **"Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”**  
  - Supporting evidence

## Key Findings

*Summarize the 5–10 most impactful findings from your study.* 

> [!TIP] 
> Write findings as stand-alone insights that are easy to scan. For example:  
> - "Most participants used the search field to locate forms, often searching for 'veteran health.'"  
> - "Participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form."
