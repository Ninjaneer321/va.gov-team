# VA Travel Reimbursement Interview Questions

## First Version

### Past Experiences

1. How do you typically get to your VA medical appointments?
  - Personal vehicle, usually with my wife
  - Changes who is driving

3. Have you ever submitted to be reimbursed for traveling for your VA medical appointment?
  - Yes, has past experience submitting for reimbursement
  - For the first couple years, I didn't even know I could do it. Then I had an appointment at a satellite clinic 50 miles from home and they handed me a form and asked about claiming mileage and I hadn’t known I could. Asked if it was because it was this far. But learned I should be eligible to claim mileage on all appointments. 
  - Logged into VA.gov the following week, using ID.me. Looked around for it and found mileage reimbursement and tried a past appointment. Too much time had passed and I couldn't submit anymore. But then figured it out and have been doing it for 6 months
  - Changed system. They updated it, easier now. Highlighted thing to click on mileage only.
    - Take our calculation, dispute mileage - that part works good
    - Awkward part is if you want to do more than one appointment, you get lost sometimes. Have to start over to do more then one. Try to remember which one you just got done filing, When there are a lot of appointments on there it is really easy to get lost. 

5. If you have submitted to be reimbursed for traveling before, did you have to upload evidence like receipts? Please describe your experience.
  - No, only ever done mileage
7. What are your expectations about Veterans being reimbursed for traveling for VA medical care?
  - I think it seems pretty logical, straightforward that they are allowing Veterans to claim mileage. I assume because there are other fields that there are certain cases where people can claim lodging and meals etc just because of what he has seen as options and the prompting questions.

### Questions from: “Trip Info” page

1. Tell me what you are looking at.
  - Now it gives me 4 steps. It is recapping the appointment date, time, location. 
  - Actually surprising to me that it doesn't have the address of the appointment. I would expect a street address because I go to 3 different addresses depending who I am seeing, so there would be 3 different calculations to reimburse for mileage. So   - I would want to see the address, not just city, VA medical center
  - I see it has the address on file for me. Assume you leave from home or the address on file
  - Has it auto filled in, not taking bus, round trip and telling me already calculated, which is what I am used to with the current system.
  - Current system asks if you want to argue/dispute it
2. What do you think you can do here? What tells you that?
  - Primary travel method..what else would you find?
      - Bus, train, taxi, or ride share maybe
      - Clicks on that - meets expectation
3. What do you think you need to do here? Why?
  - Next button: To number 2 on the form, chance to upload the receipts
  - Gets stopped because has to fill in all required fields, goes back and confirms the starting address. Makes sense for accurate calculation
