# VA Travel Reimbursement Interview Questions (Order BA)- participant on their mobile phone

## First Version A (Second in this interview)

### Past Experiences

1. How do you typically get to your VA medical appointments?
  - 99% drive 
  - Sometimes someone else drives or I ride with someone going to a same appointment the same day. At that point, two people can't double dip so only one of us can take the travel miles
2. Have you ever submitted to be reimbursed for traveling for your VA medical appointment?
  - Yes - photograph attach files, sometimes they allow it, sometimes they disallow it. Dance around with it as the VA sometimes does. It is one of those things, I had a parking thing that was disallowed, every once and a while they will counter the mileage. But I susa;;y do the mileage based on their map. I have 3 different routes (very a lot), usually do the longer miles because it is faster. Worth it for the level of care I get
  - Challenged or appealed - no, one time it was $30 for parking, just figured it was a donation to Vanderbilt and not worth fooling with 
3. If you have submitted to be reimbursed for traveling before, did you have to upload evidence like receipts? Please describe your experience.
4. What are your expectations about Veterans being reimbursed for traveling for VA medical care?
  - Well, the current BTSSS is kind of funny. It was a little bit weird to get engaged with it, but I've got it down and really know how to do it and know the ins and outs and its not chinese arithmetic at this point
  - I really like the system now. I can check out of my appointment at the VA and sit down and hit the thing and it is good to go
  - Receipts:
    - I've been doing this for so long. I used to go to a window and you submit your travel claim and they pay you in cash. Phased out about 15 years ago. Not they do direct deposit. When they went from cash to mailing a check, threw a lot of Veterans off, go to the VA expecting to have cash to pay for gas on the way home. Caught people in that situation and just pay someone $20 and then he would get that money back from them. Hey, I am short, this is what is going on. 
    - I think at the time I may have submitted the receipt straight across or mailed it in. THe one or two times that I submitted by taking the photograph and sending it in they just…it cost them more to send me a letter to deny it then it would have to pay me,, but I just tossed up my hands and said whatever

### Questions from: Intro page

1. Tell me what you are looking at.
  - This time notes the mileage rate for info page
2. Do you think you can be reimbursed? What tells you that?
3. What do you think that you need to know in order to get reimbursed? What tells you that?
4. What items or information do you think that you will need to complete this process? What tells you that?
5. Looking at this page, what do you expect to happen next? What tells you that?
  - I would put helpful tips and past appointments above “here is what we would do together” - talk to them about what they are doing, submitting a travel claim for this date and this appointment and then go into trip details and here is what we will do
  - Would go - helpful tips and past appointments, then get started and skip over the 4 boxes. Had 5 boxes before if memory serves
    - Doesn’t recall what is different 
  - Categorize expenses got squeezed into trip details

### Questions from: “Trip Info” page

1. Tell me what you are looking at.
  - You consolidated it 
  - It is doing all of that in one shot and that is a great thing. It is a truly great thing
  - Digging in on categories/expense types:
    - Nope, not on this screen - where might you see it in this process?
      - On the next screen
2. What do you think you can do here? What tells you that?
3. What do you think you need to do here? Why?
  - Check boxes for various additional expenses. If I was just doing mileage I would hit next and it would ask tolls, parking, etc, and wouldn’t check anything and just hit next again

---

### Questions from: “Receipts” page

1. Tell me what you are looking at.
  - Not asking for the types of receipts. Not asking toll, parking, just asking for the receipt itself, which I would have screen between last one and this one where they do the check boxes for type of receipt
  - If I just add a receipt it isn’t annotated as to what type of receipt. Wants to put toll receipt in toll receipt box and parking in the parking box
  - What do you think you will see when dragging in receipts:
    - Go into a review scenario where I have to check on which each receipt is for (predicated on the menu up top)
    - Expecting to see?
      - Yeah, but I am having to key in that it is a toll when I could have checked a box and that would have been done already. At this point I am having to remember what the receipts are because I can’t see them. I may be having to guess and I may guess wrong 
2. What do you think you can do here? What tells you that?
3. What do you think you need to do here? Why?
  - It should be a compilation of the two receipts plus the mileage in some sort of a format that reaps all the clicks and balances

### Questions from: “Review” page

1. Tell me what you are looking at.
  - The appointment, good, facility, good, starting address, yes, personal vehicle, yes…mileage still one way. Have 47 miles as total, which is incorrect, I had to put in the receipt titles and guess which was which based on the photos I clicked on. WOuld probably have trouble remember which was which and would need to go back and look again and do one at a time
2. What do you think you can do here? What tells you that?
3. What do you think you need to do here? Why?
4. What do you think is next?
  - Submitting and predicated on the other one and submitting it as true and correct without having to express it is true and correct

---

### Questions from: “Submission confirmed” page

1. Tell me what you are looking at.
  - Which could mean I submitted fake receipts
  - Every military person in the world, whenever they have a document to sign there is always boiler plate, they have to initial and sign. There is a whole process for executing a form in the military, I certify everything is true and correct whether I read it or not. Protects chain of command 
2. What do you think happens next? What tells you so?
3. What do you think you can do from here?

### Reflection Questions

1. On a scale of 1 to 10, how easy or difficult would you say this process was? What makes you say so? *Probe*

  - Let’s call it a 3. 
2. What would you add, change, or remove about this process? *Probe*
