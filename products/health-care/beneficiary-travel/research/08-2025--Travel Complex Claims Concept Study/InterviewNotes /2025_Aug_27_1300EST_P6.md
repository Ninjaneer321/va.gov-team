# **Intro \- 5 minutes**

## **Past experiences**

1. How do you typically get to your VA medical appointments?  
- Normally i get a link from VA on my text messages. Most of the time i go there to do my travel because it prompts me immediately to go in. recently didn’t get that so I found it on the app. And wound up getting it there because it was easier there
- Typically travel by car. One time used ride share - didn’t claim travel for it can’t remember by, might have been before I was service connected

2. Have you ever submitted to be reimbursed for traveling for your VA medical appointment?  
- See above response
3. If you have submitted to be reimbursed for traveling before, did you have to upload evidence like receipts? Please describe your experience.
-  No have never done that
4. What are your expectations about Veterans being reimbursed for traveling for VA medical care?
- I think it’s a very nice added bonus so to speak. For me I only travel 5 miles down the road, not that bad. But my spouse works at the VA and knows people who travel for 2 hours. If had to travel 2 hours would definitely want to be compensated. If travelling to the main VA closest to her would want to be compensated
