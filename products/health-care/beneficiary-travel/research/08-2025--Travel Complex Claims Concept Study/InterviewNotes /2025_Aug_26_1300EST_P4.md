# VA Travel Reimbursement Interview Questions

## First Version

### Past Experiences

1. How do you typically get to your VA medical appointments?
  - I would say, a fairly distributed three ways, public transportation, driving, and getting a ride through a nonprofit organization
  - Ride share or VA service?
    - Veteran service organization. Nonprofit but they offer that to Veterans 
2. Have you ever submitted to be reimbursed for traveling for your VA medical appointment?
  - Yes
3. If you have submitted to be reimbursed for traveling before, did you have to upload evidence like receipts? Please describe your experience.
  - No, just mileage and receipts weren’t required
  - I believe the portal is called BTSSS, I forgot what it stands for, but it looks like a VA website. It isn’t part of Va.gov portal, it looks like it is separate or external. 
  - The past two years (using portal) before that it was just at the local travel claim office by paper
4. What are your expectations about Veterans being reimbursed for traveling for VA medical care?
  - It should be a bit simpler and more direct
  - How would you imagine that?
    - Maybe bring back the kiosk check-in at the clinic. Each clinic check-in desk. 
    - You know, I am guessing the rule is that you have to show up. Showing up already, if you check-in why. I guess another request when you come back home after. 
  - Kiosk experience?
    - My local VA took it (kiosk) away. They eliminated it. I do remember the kiosk you check in and it would ask you, “do you want to claim travel” I think those were much simpler times.
