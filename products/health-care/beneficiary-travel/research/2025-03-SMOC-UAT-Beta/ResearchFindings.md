## **Details of Findings**

**Finding 1:**  



**Finding 2:** 


**Finding 3:** 

**Finding 4** 



## **Recommendations**



**Recommendation 1:** 


**Recommendation 2:** 

**Recommendation 3:** Amplify the entry point from the unauth VA Travel Reimbursement page, especially on mobile

Finding: Participants satisfice.  The majority - 6 or 9 - participants don't think too deeply from the start, but take the first thing that looks available and start their path from the unauth Top Pages section.
- Of the 2 mobile participants who ended up on the top pages path, neither saw the entry point on their own.
- Of the 3 on desktop, 2 saw the entry point on their own, while 1 went back to sign in after they could not sign in on that page.

**Recommendation 4:** Amplify the visibility of the entry point on the Claims manager tool

Finding: As seen in the tree test, expected entry locations were scattered across multiple locations.  Primary locations are Top Pages, My VA: Manage all claims and appeals, My VA
-  Every mobile user required direction. Neither of the 2 who landed on the My VA page saw the MyHealtheVet tab without direction.  The 2 desktop participants 
   who ended up on the Claims manager tool struggled to find entry point, 1 never found it and 1 almost gave up before finding it
