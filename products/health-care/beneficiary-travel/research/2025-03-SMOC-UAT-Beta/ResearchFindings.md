## **Research Goals**

The desired outcome of this study is to test key flows a Veteran user would use when submitting a simple mileage-only claim for travel for  VA medical care on VA.gov.  Broadly, the user experience research areas are around a) if and how users find the entry point to simple mileage-only claim submission from Past Appointments, b) if and how users understand what type of expenses they can submit for on VA.gov, c) if participants understand the simple mileage-only claim submission flow as designed and d) if participants understand when and why they are being redirected to BTSSS for more complex claims.  


## **Research Questions**

1. Do participants find the entry point to submission from past Appointments?

2. Do participants understand that they can only submit for simple mileage reimbursement on VA.gov?
       a. Does being redirected to a second system (BTSSS) confuse participants?
       b. When participants are redirected to BTSSS, do they understand why they are being redirected?
   
3. Do participants know if, when, and where to submit their complex claims?
     a. Do participants know how to go to BTSSS?
     b. Do participants recognize that they are being redirected to BTSSS?
   
4. Are participants accurately re-directed if they are trying to submit a complex claim?
   
5. Are participants able to complete a simple mileage-only claim submission if applicable?
   
6. Can participants differentiate between starting a claim and confirming that a claim has already been submitted?
