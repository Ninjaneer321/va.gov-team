## **Intro - max 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Cara and I'm a Researcher with the VA. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today, I’d like to ask you some questions about managing your VA claims for travel reimbursement for medical care.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:



* This entire session should take about 45 - 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. We may also end sooner than that, and if we have covered everything I want to cover I'd love to give your time back to you.
* Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
* During the session, I'll ask you to login to VA.gov and test some features using your own account. I'll be asking you to share your screen, which means we'll be seeing parts of your account, and potentially other health information. We will not use your personal health information for the study, and will redact it from any notes we take.  
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
* We like to record to confirm that we’ve captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at the VA to show user feedback. If we do this, we don’t link anything you choose to share in the session to any information that identifies you, and we remove your face and name from any videos that we share.

Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? Are you comfortable with it if we share **anonymized** video clips with our VA colleagues for research purposes?



* I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    * If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    * If yes: Admit observers.
    * Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
    * Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
* Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?


## **Section 1: Warm up questions (max 10 min)**



1. What type of device are you using right now?
2. If you have submitted for travel pay in the past, how have you done so?
    1. How often have you submitted for travel pay?
3. When it comes to your travel reimbursement claims, what would you expect to be able to do on VA.gov?
4. I know that you recently traveled to a VA facility for a medical appointment.  How did you get to your medical appointment (drive, public transit. etc)?  
    2. If drove: did you have to take any tolls or have any parking fees?
5. Do you think travel is something you can be reimbursed for? What do you think would be covered? What makes you say so?
6. If you wanted to submit for reimbursement for traveling for your appointment, where would you expect to do that?
    3. Do you think you could submit for travel reimbursement on VA.gov?


## **Section 2: Screen share (5 minutes)**

Next, I will need you to share your screen so I can see how you use the tool. Can I help walk you through how to start the screen share?

*Help participant share screen:*



* [iOS: Zoom screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)
* [Android: Zoom screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)

*If successful*



* Great, I’m seeing your screen.  
* Go to: [https://www.va.gov/](https://www.va.gov/) and help them login 


## **Section 3: UAT Tasks (30-40 min)**

**Task 1A: Find the entry point to submission:** Now, you want to submit for reimbursement for the cost of your most recent trip for a VA medical visit.  From here, where would you expect to be able to do that?  Can you show me where you would expect to start this process.



* What are you looking for?
* What do you see that makes you think that you can submit here?

**Task 2 Start submission** [on Past Appointments page]: Looking at this page, what, if anything do you think you could do here related to travel pay?



* Probe: what do you think would happen if you clicked that?
* ESTABLISHED CLAIMANT PROBE: [Do they understand that they have already submitted?] 

**Task 3 Capabilities comprehension **[on first submission screen]: Can you describe for me what you are looking at.  What do you think you can and cannot do from here? What are you looking at that makes you say so?



* Probe: What would you expect to happen if you clicked that?
* SKIP IF ESTABLISHED CLAIMANT PROBE

**Task 4 Submit SMOC** [first screen in qualifier questions]:  Ok, can you please go ahead and complete the submission.  [On each question screen ask:]



* Tell me what you are looking at
* What can you do from here
* What do you expect to happen next
* SKIP IF ESTABLISHED CLAIMANT PROBE

**Task 5 Confirm Submission**[submission confirmation page]: Can you describe for me what you are looking at.  



* Probe: What tells you that?
* What do you expect to happen next? 


## **Consent to use video clips and Closing ( 5min)**



* I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
    * If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!


## **Emergency Exit**

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
