## OCTO Priorities 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
3. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
4. Logged-in users have a personalized experience with relevant and time-saving features
5. Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of[ VA.gov](http://va.gov/)

## Veteran Journey 

1. Starting up
2. Taking care of myself
3. Putting down roots
4. Retiring

## **Research Goals**

1. To gauge if users’ mental models about a travel claim changes over the lifespan of the claim
2. To gauge if users associate a travel claim more strongly with the event that generated the claim of with other claim types supported by the VA
3. To identify where users expect to find information on the status of their Travel claim on[ VA.gov](http://va.gov/). More specifically, to evaluate the 1. Overall Success 2. Overall Directness 3. Time Taken to locate information on about a Travel Claim
4. To identify what labels or terminology for claim information resonates with users

### **Outcome**

This study will give us insight into where we should put and how we should group information/updates on post-submission Travel Claims on VA.gov. This will give us insight into where users expect to find information about…

1. A specific claim in the process of evaluation (post submission but before completion of evaluation)
2. Travel Claims (general) that have been submitted for evaluation
3. What users expect that page to be called

### **Research Questions**

1. Do users associate information about a Travel Claim with other information about the event that triggered the claim (ie, the Appointment) or with information about other types of Claims with the VA?
2. Where do users look for information about the status of their Travel Claims on VA.gov?
    1. Do users differentiate between where they expect to find information on a specific travel claim from information on travel claims in general?
3. What names or labels for information about their personal Travel Claims resonate with users?

## **Methodology**


Methodology had 3 main parts:



1. Tree test tasks in Optimal Workshop, **alternating task order** with 66 total Veteran participants:
    1. Task 1 (**Recent claim**):  You submitted a request to be paid back for gas after traveling to your last VA doctor visit on January 12, 2024 and want to get an update on that request. Where would you find this information?
    2. Task 2 (**Historical claim**): You have submitted several requests to be reimbursed for gas for traveling to see your VA doctor multiple times following surgery in Spring 2023. You want to know what happened to those requests. Where would you find this information?
    3. Post - task questions rating how confidence and ease on a scale of 1 to 7 
        1. Overall, how difficult did you find this task? Rating scale, 1 - Very difficult, 7 - Very easy
        2. Overall, how confident are you that you completed this task successfully? Rating scale, 1 - Not at all confident, 7 - Extremely confident
2. Labeling open ended question
3. Forced ranking question of potential labels of travel reimbursement status

## **Key Findings and Hypotheses**


### Findings

1. No single destination  signaled particularly high as a destination for travel claim status information.  The highest performer was the “File a claim for travel reimbursement” page at ~30% followed by ‘Manage all claims and appeals” at ~12%
3. Participants did not appear to differentiate between where to look for the recent claim and the historical claim, indicating that users would expect to find the two types in the same general area or they did not understand the nuances between the scenarios
4. Location signal was split between MyHealtheVet, My VA and VA Benefits and Health Care
5. “Travel Reimbursement Status” was the highest performing label for this information, echoing participants desire for a simple and straightforward term.

### Hypotheses

**1.**  We hypothesize that participants will look for more recent Travel Claims associated with the **Appointment** that generated the claim.

**Finding:** Not supported.  For the recent claim task, only 1 in 66 participants went to the Appointments area.  

**5.** We hypothesize that users will look for information on Travel Claims - recent or historical - in the My VA health benefits section of MyHealtheVet (**Home > MyHealtheVet > My VA health benefits**).

**Finding:** Not supported.  Only 1 of 66 participants selected this path (MyHealtheVet > My VA health benefits > Update health benefits info.

**3.**  We hypothesize that participants will look for an overview of their past Travel Claims history in their **Profile** or **Payments** section.

**Finding:** Payments is partially supported.  Profile is not supported.

For the historic task, 24% of all participants (29% of historic first participants) selected Home > MyHealtheVet > **Payments** > **File a claim for travel reimbursement **as their destination 

For the historic task, 3% of all participants  selected Home > Profile as their destination

**2.** We hypothesize that participants will look for **older claims** (6+ months ago) in the **Claim status tool** or **Payments** section.

**Finding:** Partially supported.  

For the historic task, 24% of all participants (29% of historic first participants) selected Home > MyHealtheVet > Payments > File a claim for travel reimbursement as their destination 

For the historic task, 15% of all participants (but only 7% of historic first participants) selected Home > My VA > Claims and appeals > Manage all claims and appeals as their destination 

**6.**  We hypothesize that participants will look to check the status of a travel claim on the **page where they submit** travel claims.

**Finding:** Supported.  This was the most popular destination for participants.

For the historic task, 24% of all participants (29% of historic first participants) selected Home > MyHealtheVet > Payments > File a claim for travel reimbursement as their destination 

For the recent task, 30% of all participants (30% of recent first participants) selected Home > MyHealtheVet > Payments > **File a claim for travel reimbursement **as their destination 

**4.** We hypothesize that participants will look for status updates on Travel Pay claims on its **own distinct page**.

**Finding:** Supported.  The absence of a clear leader in the existing structure  indicates that the current structure may not support an easily findable location as is.  


## **Details of Findings**

**Finding 1:** No single destination  signaled particularly high as a destination for travel claim status information.  The highest performer was the “File a claim for travel reimbursement” page at ~30% followed by ‘Manage all claims and appeals” at ~12%

**Finding 2:** Participants did not appear to differentiate between where to look for the recent claim and the historical claim, indicating that users would expect to find the two types in the same general area or they did not understand the nuances between the scenarios.  

Based on the destinations participants selected, it appears users’ mental model associates a Travel claim most strongly first with travel claim submission and secondly with the management of other claims.
